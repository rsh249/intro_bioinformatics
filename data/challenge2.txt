   843	CHAPTER I
   844	
   845	âWell, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the
   846	Buonapartes. But I warn you, if you donât tell me that this means war,
   847	if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that
   848	AntichristâI really believe he is AntichristâI will have nothing
   849	more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my
   850	âfaithful slave,â as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I
   851	have frightened youâsit down and tell me all the news.â
   852	
   853	It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna PÃ¡vlovna
   854	SchÃ©rer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress MÃ¡rya FÃ«dorovna.
   855	With these words she greeted Prince VasÃ­li KurÃ¡gin, a man of high
   856	rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna
   857	PÃ¡vlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering
   858	from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used
   859	only by the elite.
   860	
   861	All her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered
   862	by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:
   863	
   864	âIf you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the
   865	prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible,
   866	I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10âAnnette
   867	SchÃ©rer.â
   868	
   869	âHeavens! what a virulent attack!â replied the prince, not in the
   870	least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an
   871	embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on
   872	his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that
   873	refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and
   874	with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance
   875	who had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna PÃ¡vlovna,
   876	kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head,
   877	and complacently seated himself on the sofa.
   878	
   879	âFirst of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friendâs
   880	mind at rest,â said he without altering his tone, beneath the
   881	politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony
   882	could be discerned.
   883	
   884	âCan one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times
   885	like these if one has any feeling?â said Anna PÃ¡vlovna. âYou are
   886	staying the whole evening, I hope?â
   887	
   888	âAnd the fete at the English ambassadorâs? Today is Wednesday. I
   889	must put in an appearance there,â said the prince. âMy daughter is
   890	coming for me to take me there.â
   891	
   892	âI thought todayâs fete had been canceled. I confess all these
   893	festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.â
   894	
   895	âIf they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have
   896	been put off,â said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force
   897	of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.
   898	
   899	âDonât tease! Well, and what has been decided about NovosÃ­ltsevâs
   900	dispatch? You know everything.â
   901	
   902	âWhat can one say about it?â replied the prince in a cold, listless
   903	tone. âWhat has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has
   904	burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.â
   905	
   906	Prince VasÃ­li always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale
   907	part. Anna PÃ¡vlovna SchÃ©rer on the contrary, despite her forty years,
   908	overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast had
   909	become her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not
   910	feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the
   911	expectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile which, though it
   912	did not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed,
   913	as in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect,
   914	which she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to
   915	correct.
   916	
   917	In the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna PÃ¡vlovna burst
   918	out:
   919	
   920	âOh, donât speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I donât understand
   921	things, but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war. She
   922	is betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracious sovereign
   923	recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it. That is the one
   924	thing I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform
   925	the noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble that God will
   926	not forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of
   927	revolution, which has become more terrible than ever in the person of
   928	this murderer and villain! We alone must avenge the blood of the just
   929	one.... Whom, I ask you, can we rely on?... England with her commercial
   930	spirit will not and cannot understand the Emperor Alexanderâs
   931	loftiness of soul. She has refused to evacuate Malta. She wanted to
   932	find, and still seeks, some secret motive in our actions. What answer
   933	did NovosÃ­ltsev get? None. The English have not understood and cannot
   934	understand the self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for
   935	himself, but only desires the good of mankind. And what have they
   936	promised? Nothing! And what little they have promised they will not
   937	perform! Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and
   938	that all Europe is powerless before him.... And I donât believe a
   939	word that Hardenburg says, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian
   940	neutrality is just a trap. I have faith only in God and the lofty
   941	destiny of our adored monarch. He will save Europe!â
   942	
   943	She suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity.
   944	
   945	âI think,â said the prince with a smile, âthat if you had been
   946	sent instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the King
   947	of Prussiaâs consent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will you give me
   948	a cup of tea?â
   949	
   950	âIn a moment. Ã propos,â she added, becoming calm again, âI am
   951	expecting two very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart, who
   952	is connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of the best
   953	French families. He is one of the genuine Ã©migrÃ©s, the good ones. And
   954	also the AbbÃ© Morio. Do you know that profound thinker? He has been
   955	received by the Emperor. Had you heard?â
   956	
   957	âI shall be delighted to meet them,â said the prince. âBut
   958	tell me,â he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just
   959	occurred to him, though the question he was about to ask was the chief
   960	motive of his visit, âis it true that the Dowager Empress wants
   961	Baron Funke to be appointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all
   962	accounts is a poor creature.â
   963	
   964	Prince VasÃ­li wished to obtain this post for his son, but others were
   965	trying through the Dowager Empress MÃ¡rya FÃ«dorovna to secure it for
   966	the baron.
   967	
   968	Anna PÃ¡vlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor
   969	anyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or was
   970	pleased with.
   971	
   972	âBaron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her
   973	sister,â was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone.
   974	
   975	As she named the Empress, Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs face suddenly assumed an
   976	expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with
   977	sadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious
   978	patroness. She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron Funke
   979	beaucoup dâestime, and again her face clouded over with sadness.
   980	
   981	The prince was silent and looked indifferent. But, with the womanly and
   982	courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, Anna PÃ¡vlovna
   983	wished both to rebuke him (for daring to speak as he had done of a man
   984	recommended to the Empress) and at the same time to console him, so she
   985	said:
   986	
   987	âNow about your family. Do you know that since your daughter came
   988	out everyone has been enraptured by her? They say she is amazingly
   989	beautiful.â
   990	
   991	The prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude.
   992	
   993	âI often think,â she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer
   994	to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political
   995	and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate
   996	conversationââI often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life
   997	are distributed. Why has fate given you two such splendid children?
   998	I donât speak of Anatole, your youngest. I donât like him,â she
   999	added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows.
  1000	âTwo such charming children. And really you appreciate them less than
  1001	anyone, and so you donât deserve to have them.â
  1002	
  1003	And she smiled her ecstatic smile.
  1004	
  1005	âI canât help it,â said the prince. âLavater would have said I
  1006	lack the bump of paternity.â
  1007	
  1008	âDonât joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you know
  1009	I am dissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselvesâ (and her
  1010	face assumed its melancholy expression), âhe was mentioned at Her
  1011	Majestyâs and you were pitied....â
  1012	
  1013	The prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly,
  1014	awaiting a reply. He frowned.
  1015	
  1016	âWhat would you have me do?â he said at last. âYou know I did all
  1017	a father could for their education, and they have both turned out fools.
  1018	Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active one. That
  1019	is the only difference between them.â He said this smiling in a way
  1020	more natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles round
  1021	his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and
  1022	unpleasant.
  1023	
  1024	âAnd why are children born to such men as you? If you were not a
  1025	father there would be nothing I could reproach you with,â said Anna
  1026	PÃ¡vlovna, looking up pensively.
  1027	
  1028	âI am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my
  1029	children are the bane of my life. It is the cross I have to bear. That
  1030	is how I explain it to myself. It canât be helped!â
  1031	
  1032	He said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a
  1033	gesture. Anna PÃ¡vlovna meditated.
  1034	
  1035	âHave you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole?â she
  1036	asked. âThey say old maids have a mania for matchmaking, and though I
  1037	donât feel that weakness in myself as yet, I know a little person who
  1038	is very unhappy with her father. She is a relation of yours, Princess
  1039	Mary BolkÃ³nskaya.â
  1040	
  1041	Prince VasÃ­li did not reply, though, with the quickness of memory and
  1042	perception befitting a man of the world, he indicated by a movement of
  1043	the head that he was considering this information.
  1044	
  1045	âDo you know,â he said at last, evidently unable to check the sad
  1046	current of his thoughts, âthat Anatole is costing me forty thousand
  1047	rubles a year? And,â he went on after a pause, âwhat will it be in
  1048	five years, if he goes on like this?â Presently he added: âThatâs
  1049	what we fathers have to put up with.... Is this princess of yours
  1050	rich?â
  1051	
  1052	âHer father is very rich and stingy. He lives in the country. He is
  1053	the well-known Prince BolkÃ³nski who had to retire from the army under
  1054	the late Emperor, and was nicknamed âthe King of Prussia.â He is
  1055	very clever but eccentric, and a bore. The poor girl is very unhappy.
  1056	She has a brother; I think you know him, he married Lise Meinen lately.
  1057	He is an aide-de-camp of KutÃºzovâs and will be here tonight.â
  1058	
  1059	âListen, dear Annette,â said the prince, suddenly taking Anna
  1060	PÃ¡vlovnaâs hand and for some reason drawing it downwards. âArrange
  1061	that affair for me and I shall always be your most devoted slave-slafe
  1062	with an f, as a village elder of mine writes in his reports. She is rich
  1063	and of good family and thatâs all I want.â
  1064	
  1065	And with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him, he raised the
  1066	maid of honorâs hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to and fro
  1067	as he lay back in his armchair, looking in another direction.
  1068	
  1069	âAttendez,â said Anna PÃ¡vlovna, reflecting, âIâll speak to
  1070	Lise, young BolkÃ³nskiâs wife, this very evening, and perhaps the
  1071	thing can be arranged. It shall be on your familyâs behalf that Iâll
  1072	start my apprenticeship as old maid.â
  1073	
  1074	
  1075	
  1076	
  1077	
  1078	CHAPTER II
  1079	
  1080	Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs drawing room was gradually filling. The highest
  1081	Petersburg society was assembled there: people differing widely in age
  1082	and character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged.
  1083	Prince VasÃ­liâs daughter, the beautiful HÃ©lÃ¨ne, came to take her
  1084	father to the ambassadorâs entertainment; she wore a ball dress and
  1085	her badge as maid of honor. The youthful little Princess BolkÃ³nskaya,
  1086	known as la femme la plus sÃ©duisante de PÃ©tersbourg, * was also there.
  1087	She had been married during the previous winter, and being pregnant did
  1088	not go to any large gatherings, but only to small receptions. Prince
  1089	VasÃ­liâs son, Hippolyte, had come with Mortemart, whom he introduced.
  1090	The AbbÃ© Morio and many others had also come.
  1091	
  1092	     * The most fascinating woman in Petersburg.
  1093	
  1094	To each new arrival Anna PÃ¡vlovna said, âYou have not yet seen my
  1095	aunt,â or âYou do not know my aunt?â and very gravely conducted
  1096	him or her to a little old lady, wearing large bows of ribbon in her
  1097	cap, who had come sailing in from another room as soon as the guests
  1098	began to arrive; and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her
  1099	aunt, Anna PÃ¡vlovna mentioned each oneâs name and then left them.
  1100	
  1101	Each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not
  1102	one of them knew, not one of them wanted to know, and not one of them
  1103	cared about; Anna PÃ¡vlovna observed these greetings with mournful and
  1104	solemn interest and silent approval. The aunt spoke to each of them in
  1105	the same words, about their health and her own, and the health of Her
  1106	Majesty, âwho, thank God, was better today.â And each visitor,
  1107	though politeness prevented his showing impatience, left the old woman
  1108	with a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not
  1109	return to her the whole evening.
  1110	
  1111	The young Princess BolkÃ³nskaya had brought some work in a
  1112	gold-embroidered velvet bag. Her pretty little upper lip, on which a
  1113	delicate dark down was just perceptible, was too short for her teeth,
  1114	but it lifted all the more sweetly, and was especially charming when she
  1115	occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip. As is always the case
  1116	with a thoroughly attractive woman, her defectâthe shortness of her
  1117	upper lip and her half-open mouthâseemed to be her own special and
  1118	peculiar form of beauty. Everyone brightened at the sight of this pretty
  1119	young woman, so soon to become a mother, so full of life and health, and
  1120	carrying her burden so lightly. Old men and dull dispirited young ones
  1121	who looked at her, after being in her company and talking to her a
  1122	little while, felt as if they too were becoming, like her, full of life
  1123	and health. All who talked to her, and at each word saw her bright smile
  1124	and the constant gleam of her white teeth, thought that they were in a
  1125	specially amiable mood that day.
  1126	
  1127	The little princess went round the table with quick, short, swaying
  1128	steps, her workbag on her arm, and gaily spreading out her dress sat
  1129	down on a sofa near the silver samovar, as if all she was doing was a
  1130	pleasure to herself and to all around her. âI have brought my work,â
  1131	said she in French, displaying her bag and addressing all present.
  1132	âMind, Annette, I hope you have not played a wicked trick on me,â
  1133	she added, turning to her hostess. âYou wrote that it was to be quite
  1134	a small reception, and just see how badly I am dressed.â And she
  1135	spread out her arms to show her short-waisted, lace-trimmed, dainty gray
  1136	dress, girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast.
  1137	
  1138	âSoyez tranquille, Lise, you will always be prettier than anyone
  1139	else,â replied Anna PÃ¡vlovna.
  1140	
  1141	âYou know,â said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in
  1142	French, turning to a general, âmy husband is deserting me? He is going
  1143	to get himself killed. Tell me what this wretched war is for?â she
  1144	added, addressing Prince VasÃ­li, and without waiting for an answer she
  1145	turned to speak to his daughter, the beautiful HÃ©lÃ¨ne.
  1146	
  1147	âWhat a delightful woman this little princess is!â said Prince
  1148	VasÃ­li to Anna PÃ¡vlovna.
  1149	
  1150	One of the next arrivals was a stout, heavily built young man with
  1151	close-cropped hair, spectacles, the light-colored breeches fashionable
  1152	at that time, a very high ruffle, and a brown dress coat. This stout
  1153	young man was an illegitimate son of Count BezÃºkhov, a well-known
  1154	grandee of Catherineâs time who now lay dying in Moscow. The young man
  1155	had not yet entered either the military or civil service, as he had only
  1156	just returned from abroad where he had been educated, and this was his
  1157	first appearance in society. Anna PÃ¡vlovna greeted him with the nod she
  1158	accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room. But in spite of
  1159	this lowest-grade greeting, a look of anxiety and fear, as at the sight
  1160	of something too large and unsuited to the place, came over her face
  1161	when she saw Pierre enter. Though he was certainly rather bigger than
  1162	the other men in the room, her anxiety could only have reference to
  1163	the clever though shy, but observant and natural, expression which
  1164	distinguished him from everyone else in that drawing room.
  1165	
  1166	âIt is very good of you, Monsieur Pierre, to come and visit a poor
  1167	invalid,â said Anna PÃ¡vlovna, exchanging an alarmed glance with her
  1168	aunt as she conducted him to her.
  1169	
  1170	Pierre murmured something unintelligible, and continued to look round as
  1171	if in search of something. On his way to the aunt he bowed to the little
  1172	princess with a pleased smile, as to an intimate acquaintance.
  1173	
  1174	Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs alarm was justified, for Pierre turned away from the
  1175	aunt without waiting to hear her speech about Her Majestyâs health.
  1176	Anna PÃ¡vlovna in dismay detained him with the words: âDo you know the
  1177	AbbÃ© Morio? He is a most interesting man.â
  1178	
  1179	âYes, I have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace, and it is very
  1180	interesting but hardly feasible.â
  1181	
  1182	âYou think so?â rejoined Anna PÃ¡vlovna in order to say something
  1183	and get away to attend to her duties as hostess. But Pierre now
  1184	committed a reverse act of impoliteness. First he had left a lady before
  1185	she had finished speaking to him, and now he continued to speak to
  1186	another who wished to get away. With his head bent, and his big feet
  1187	spread apart, he began explaining his reasons for thinking the abbÃ©âs
  1188	plan chimerical.
  1189	
  1190	âWe will talk of it later,â said Anna PÃ¡vlovna with a smile.
  1191	
  1192	And having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave, she
  1193	resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch, ready
  1194	to help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag. As
  1195	the foreman of a spinning mill, when he has set the hands to work, goes
  1196	round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that
  1197	creaks or makes more noise than it should, and hastens to check the
  1198	machine or set it in proper motion, so Anna PÃ¡vlovna moved about her
  1199	drawing room, approaching now a silent, now a too-noisy group, and by a
  1200	word or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady,
  1201	proper, and regular motion. But amid these cares her anxiety about
  1202	Pierre was evident. She kept an anxious watch on him when he approached
  1203	the group round Mortemart to listen to what was being said there, and
  1204	again when he passed to another group whose center was the abbÃ©.
  1205	
  1206	Pierre had been educated abroad, and this reception at Anna
  1207	PÃ¡vlovnaâs was the first he had attended in Russia. He knew that all
  1208	the intellectual lights of Petersburg were gathered there and, like a
  1209	child in a toyshop, did not know which way to look, afraid of missing
  1210	any clever conversation that was to be heard. Seeing the self-confident
  1211	and refined expression on the faces of those present he was always
  1212	expecting to hear something very profound. At last he came up to Morio.
  1213	Here the conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an
  1214	opportunity to express his own views, as young people are fond of doing.
  1215	
  1216	
  1217	
  1218	
  1219	
  1220	CHAPTER III
  1221	
  1222	Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs reception was in full swing. The spindles hummed
  1223	steadily and ceaselessly on all sides. With the exception of the aunt,
  1224	beside whom sat only one elderly lady, who with her thin careworn face
  1225	was rather out of place in this brilliant society, the whole company had
  1226	settled into three groups. One, chiefly masculine, had formed round
  1227	the abbÃ©. Another, of young people, was grouped round the beautiful
  1228	Princess HÃ©lÃ¨ne, Prince VasÃ­liâs daughter, and the little Princess
  1229	BolkÃ³nskaya, very pretty and rosy, though rather too plump for her age.
  1230	The third group was gathered round Mortemart and Anna PÃ¡vlovna.
  1231	
  1232	The vicomte was a nice-looking young man with soft features and polished
  1233	manners, who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out of
  1234	politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in
  1235	which he found himself. Anna PÃ¡vlovna was obviously serving him up as
  1236	a treat to her guests. As a clever maÃ®tre dâhÃ´tel serves up as a
  1237	specially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in
  1238	the kitchen would have cared to eat, so Anna PÃ¡vlovna served up to
  1239	her guests, first the vicomte and then the abbÃ©, as peculiarly choice
  1240	morsels. The group about Mortemart immediately began discussing the
  1241	murder of the Duc dâEnghien. The vicomte said that the Duc dâEnghien
  1242	had perished by his own magnanimity, and that there were particular
  1243	reasons for Buonaparteâs hatred of him.
  1244	
  1245	âAh, yes! Do tell us all about it, Vicomte,â said Anna PÃ¡vlovna,
  1246	with a pleasant feeling that there was something Ã  la Louis XV in the
  1247	sound of that sentence: âContez nous Ã§ela, Vicomte.â
  1248	
  1249	The vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness to
  1250	comply. Anna PÃ¡vlovna arranged a group round him, inviting everyone to
  1251	listen to his tale.
  1252	
  1253	âThe vicomte knew the duc personally,â whispered Anna PÃ¡vlovna to
  1254	one of the guests. âThe vicomte is a wonderful raconteur,â said she
  1255	to another. âHow evidently he belongs to the best society,â said she
  1256	to a third; and the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest
  1257	and most advantageous style, like a well-garnished joint of roast beef
  1258	on a hot dish.
  1259	
  1260	The vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile.
  1261	
  1262	âCome over here, HÃ©lÃ¨ne, dear,â said Anna PÃ¡vlovna to the
  1263	beautiful young princess who was sitting some way off, the center of
  1264	another group.
  1265	
  1266	The princess smiled. She rose with the same unchanging smile with which
  1267	she had first entered the roomâthe smile of a perfectly beautiful
  1268	woman. With a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss
  1269	and ivy, with a gleam of white shoulders, glossy hair, and sparkling
  1270	diamonds, she passed between the men who made way for her, not looking
  1271	at any of them but smiling on all, as if graciously allowing each the
  1272	privilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders,
  1273	back, and bosomâwhich in the fashion of those days were very much
  1274	exposedâand she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as
  1275	she moved toward Anna PÃ¡vlovna. HÃ©lÃ¨ne was so lovely that not only
  1276	did she not show any trace of coquetry, but on the contrary she even
  1277	appeared shy of her unquestionable and all too victorious beauty. She
  1278	seemed to wish, but to be unable, to diminish its effect.
  1279	
  1280	âHow lovely!â said everyone who saw her; and the vicomte lifted his
  1281	shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinary
  1282	when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with her
  1283	unchanging smile.
  1284	
  1285	âMadame, I doubt my ability before such an audience,â said he,
  1286	smilingly inclining his head.
  1287	
  1288	The princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considered
  1289	a reply unnecessary. She smilingly waited. All the time the story was
  1290	being told she sat upright, glancing now at her beautiful round arm,
  1291	altered in shape by its pressure on the table, now at her still more
  1292	beautiful bosom, on which she readjusted a diamond necklace. From time
  1293	to time she smoothed the folds of her dress, and whenever the story
  1294	produced an effect she glanced at Anna PÃ¡vlovna, at once adopted just
  1295	the expression she saw on the maid of honorâs face, and again relapsed
  1296	into her radiant smile.
  1297	
  1298	The little princess had also left the tea table and followed HÃ©lÃ¨ne.
  1299	
  1300	âWait a moment, Iâll get my work.... Now then, what are you
  1301	thinking of?â she went on, turning to Prince Hippolyte. âFetch me my
  1302	workbag.â
  1303	
  1304	There was a general movement as the princess, smiling and talking
  1305	merrily to everyone at once, sat down and gaily arranged herself in her
  1306	seat.
  1307	
  1308	âNow I am all right,â she said, and asking the vicomte to begin, she
  1309	took up her work.
  1310	
  1311	Prince Hippolyte, having brought the workbag, joined the circle and
  1312	moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her.
  1313	
  1314	Le charmant Hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary resemblance
  1315	to his beautiful sister, but yet more by the fact that in spite of
  1316	this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly. His features were like his
  1317	sisterâs, but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous,
  1318	self-satisfied, youthful, and constant smile of animation, and by the
  1319	wonderful classic beauty of her figure, his face on the contrary
  1320	was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen
  1321	self-confidence, while his body was thin and weak. His eyes, nose, and
  1322	mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant, wearied grimace, and his arms
  1323	and legs always fell into unnatural positions.
  1324	
  1325	âItâs not going to be a ghost story?â said he, sitting down beside
  1326	the princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette, as if without this
  1327	instrument he could not begin to speak.
  1328	
  1329	âWhy no, my dear fellow,â said the astonished narrator, shrugging
  1330	his shoulders.
  1331	
  1332	âBecause I hate ghost stories,â said Prince Hippolyte in a tone
  1333	which showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he
  1334	had uttered them.
  1335	
  1336	He spoke with such self-confidence that his hearers could not be sure
  1337	whether what he said was very witty or very stupid. He was dressed in
  1338	a dark-green dress coat, knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nymphe
  1339	effrayÃ©e, as he called it, shoes, and silk stockings.
  1340	
  1341	The vicomte told his tale very neatly. It was an anecdote, then current,
  1342	to the effect that the Duc dâEnghien had gone secretly to Paris to
  1343	visit Mademoiselle George; that at her house he came upon Bonaparte,
  1344	who also enjoyed the famous actressâ favors, and that in his presence
  1345	Napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was
  1346	subject, and was thus at the ducâs mercy. The latter spared him, and
  1347	this magnanimity Bonaparte subsequently repaid by death.
  1348	
  1349	The story was very pretty and interesting, especially at the point
  1350	where the rivals suddenly recognized one another; and the ladies looked
  1351	agitated.
  1352	
  1353	âCharming!â said Anna PÃ¡vlovna with an inquiring glance at the
  1354	little princess.
  1355	
  1356	âCharming!â whispered the little princess, sticking the needle into
  1357	her work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the story
  1358	prevented her from going on with it.
  1359	
  1360	The vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully
  1361	prepared to continue, but just then Anna PÃ¡vlovna, who had kept a
  1362	watchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her, noticed that he was
  1363	talking too loudly and vehemently with the abbÃ©, so she hurried to the
  1364	rescue. Pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbÃ© about
  1365	the balance of power, and the latter, evidently interested by the young
  1366	manâs simple-minded eagerness, was explaining his pet theory. Both
  1367	were talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally, which was why
  1368	Anna PÃ¡vlovna disapproved.
  1369	
  1370	âThe means are ... the balance of power in Europe and the rights of
  1371	the people,â the abbÃ© was saying. âIt is only necessary for one
  1372	powerful nation like Russiaâbarbaric as she is said to beâto place
  1373	herself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its object
  1374	the maintenance of the balance of power of Europe, and it would save the
  1375	world!â
  1376	
  1377	âBut how are you to get that balance?â Pierre was beginning.
  1378	
  1379	At that moment Anna PÃ¡vlovna came up and, looking severely at Pierre,
  1380	asked the Italian how he stood Russian climate. The Italianâs
  1381	face instantly changed and assumed an offensively affected, sugary
  1382	expression, evidently habitual to him when conversing with women.
  1383	
  1384	âI am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the
  1385	society, more especially of the feminine society, in which I have had
  1386	the honor of being received, that I have not yet had time to think of
  1387	the climate,â said he.
  1388	
  1389	Not letting the abbÃ© and Pierre escape, Anna PÃ¡vlovna, the more
  1390	conveniently to keep them under observation, brought them into the
  1391	larger circle.
  1392	
  1393	
  1394	
  1395	
  1396	
  1397	CHAPTER IV
  1398	
  1399	Just then another visitor entered the drawing room: Prince Andrew
  1400	BolkÃ³nski, the little princessâ husband. He was a very handsome young
  1401	man, of medium height, with firm, clearcut features. Everything about
  1402	him, from his weary, bored expression to his quiet, measured step,
  1403	offered a most striking contrast to his quiet, little wife. It was
  1404	evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing room, but had
  1405	found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen to
  1406	them. And among all these faces that he found so tedious, none seemed
  1407	to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife. He turned away from
  1408	her with a grimace that distorted his handsome face, kissed Anna
  1409	PÃ¡vlovnaâs hand, and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company.
  1410	
  1411	âYou are off to the war, Prince?â said Anna PÃ¡vlovna.
  1412	
  1413	âGeneral KutÃºzov,â said BolkÃ³nski, speaking French and stressing
  1414	the last syllable of the generalâs name like a Frenchman, âhas been
  1415	pleased to take me as an aide-de-camp....â
  1416	
  1417	âAnd Lise, your wife?â
  1418	
  1419	âShe will go to the country.â
  1420	
  1421	âAre you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife?â
  1422	
  1423	âAndrÃ©,â said his wife, addressing her husband in the same
  1424	coquettish manner in which she spoke to other men, âthe vicomte has
  1425	been telling us such a tale about Mademoiselle George and Buonaparte!â
  1426	
  1427	Prince Andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away. Pierre, who from
  1428	the moment Prince Andrew entered the room had watched him with glad,
  1429	affectionate eyes, now came up and took his arm. Before he looked round
  1430	Prince Andrew frowned again, expressing his annoyance with whoever was
  1431	touching his arm, but when he saw Pierreâs beaming face he gave him an
  1432	unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile.
  1433	
  1434	âThere now!... So you, too, are in the great world?â said he to
  1435	Pierre.
  1436	
  1437	âI knew you would be here,â replied Pierre. âI will come to supper
  1438	with you. May I?â he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the
  1439	vicomte who was continuing his story.
  1440	
  1441	âNo, impossible!â said Prince Andrew, laughing and pressing
  1442	Pierreâs hand to show that there was no need to ask the question. He
  1443	wished to say something more, but at that moment Prince VasÃ­li and his
  1444	daughter got up to go and the two young men rose to let them pass.
  1445	
  1446	âYou must excuse me, dear Vicomte,â said Prince VasÃ­li to the
  1447	Frenchman, holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent
  1448	his rising. âThis unfortunate fete at the ambassadorâs deprives me
  1449	of a pleasure, and obliges me to interrupt you. I am very sorry to leave
  1450	your enchanting party,â said he, turning to Anna PÃ¡vlovna.
  1451	
  1452	His daughter, Princess HÃ©lÃ¨ne, passed between the chairs, lightly
  1453	holding up the folds of her dress, and the smile shone still more
  1454	radiantly on her beautiful face. Pierre gazed at her with rapturous,
  1455	almost frightened, eyes as she passed him.
  1456	
  1457	âVery lovely,â said Prince Andrew.
  1458	
  1459	âVery,â said Pierre.
  1460	
  1461	In passing Prince VasÃ­li seized Pierreâs hand and said to Anna
  1462	PÃ¡vlovna: âEducate this bear for me! He has been staying with me
  1463	a whole month and this is the first time I have seen him in society.
  1464	Nothing is so necessary for a young man as the society of clever
  1465	women.â
  1466	
  1467	
  1468	Anna PÃ¡vlovna smiled and promised to take Pierre in hand. She knew his
  1469	father to be a connection of Prince VasÃ­liâs. The elderly lady who
  1470	had been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook Prince
  1471	VasÃ­li in the anteroom. All the affectation of interest she had assumed
  1472	had left her kindly and tear-worn face and it now expressed only anxiety
  1473	and fear.
  1474	
  1475	âHow about my son BorÃ­s, Prince?â said she, hurrying after him into
  1476	the anteroom. âI canât remain any longer in Petersburg. Tell me what
  1477	news I may take back to my poor boy.â
  1478	
  1479	Although Prince VasÃ­li listened reluctantly and not very politely
  1480	to the elderly lady, even betraying some impatience, she gave him an
  1481	ingratiating and appealing smile, and took his hand that he might not go
  1482	away.
  1483	
  1484	âWhat would it cost you to say a word to the Emperor, and then he
  1485	would be transferred to the Guards at once?â said she.
  1486	
  1487	âBelieve me, Princess, I am ready to do all I can,â answered Prince
  1488	VasÃ­li, âbut it is difficult for me to ask the Emperor. I should
  1489	advise you to appeal to RumyÃ¡ntsev through Prince GolÃ­tsyn. That would
  1490	be the best way.â
  1491	
  1492	The elderly lady was a Princess DrubetskÃ¡ya, belonging to one of the
  1493	best families in Russia, but she was poor, and having long been out of
  1494	society had lost her former influential connections. She had now come to
  1495	Petersburg to procure an appointment in the Guards for her only son.
  1496	It was, in fact, solely to meet Prince VasÃ­li that she had obtained an
  1497	invitation to Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs reception and had sat listening to
  1498	the vicomteâs story. Prince VasÃ­liâs words frightened her, an
  1499	embittered look clouded her once handsome face, but only for a moment;
  1500	then she smiled again and clutched Prince VasÃ­liâs arm more tightly.
  1501	
  1502	âListen to me, Prince,â said she. âI have never yet asked you
  1503	for anything and I never will again, nor have I ever reminded you of my
  1504	fatherâs friendship for you; but now I entreat you for Godâs sake to
  1505	do this for my sonâand I shall always regard you as a benefactor,â
  1506	she added hurriedly. âNo, donât be angry, but promise! I have asked
  1507	GolÃ­tsyn and he has refused. Be the kindhearted man you always were,â
  1508	she said, trying to smile though tears were in her eyes.
  1509	
  1510	âPapa, we shall be late,â said Princess HÃ©lÃ¨ne, turning her
  1511	beautiful head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she
  1512	stood waiting by the door.
  1513	
  1514	Influence in society, however, is a capital which has to be economized
  1515	if it is to last. Prince VasÃ­li knew this, and having once realized
  1516	that if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him, he would soon be
  1517	unable to ask for himself, he became chary of using his influence. But
  1518	in Princess DrubetskÃ¡yaâs case he felt, after her second appeal,
  1519	something like qualms of conscience. She had reminded him of what was
  1520	quite true; he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in
  1521	his career. Moreover, he could see by her manners that she was one of
  1522	those womenâmostly mothersâwho, having once made up their minds,
  1523	will not rest until they have gained their end, and are prepared if
  1524	necessary to go on insisting day after day and hour after hour, and even
  1525	to make scenes. This last consideration moved him.
  1526	
  1527	âMy dear Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna,â said he with his usual familiarity and
  1528	weariness of tone, âit is almost impossible for me to do what you
  1529	ask; but to prove my devotion to you and how I respect your fatherâs
  1530	memory, I will do the impossibleâyour son shall be transferred to the
  1531	Guards. Here is my hand on it. Are you satisfied?â
  1532	
  1533	âMy dear benefactor! This is what I expected from youâI knew your
  1534	kindness!â He turned to go.
  1535	
  1536	âWaitâjust a word! When he has been transferred to the Guards...â
  1537	she faltered. âYou are on good terms with Michael IlariÃ³novich
  1538	KutÃºzov ... recommend BorÃ­s to him as adjutant! Then I shall be at
  1539	rest, and then...â
  1540	
  1541	Prince VasÃ­li smiled.
  1542	
  1543	âNo, I wonât promise that. You donât know how KutÃºzov is pestered
  1544	since his appointment as Commander in Chief. He told me himself that
  1545	all the Moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as
  1546	adjutants.â
  1547	
  1548	âNo, but do promise! I wonât let you go! My dear benefactor...â
  1549	
  1550	âPapa,â said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before,
  1551	âwe shall be late.â
  1552	
  1553	âWell, au revoir! Good-by! You hear her?â
  1554	
  1555	âThen tomorrow you will speak to the Emperor?â
  1556	
  1557	âCertainly; but about KutÃºzov, I donât promise.â
  1558	
  1559	âDo promise, do promise, VasÃ­li!â cried Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna as he
  1560	went, with the smile of a coquettish girl, which at one time probably
  1561	came naturally to her, but was now very ill-suited to her careworn face.
  1562	
  1563	Apparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employed
  1564	all the old feminine arts. But as soon as the prince had gone her face
  1565	resumed its former cold, artificial expression. She returned to the
  1566	group where the vicomte was still talking, and again pretended to
  1567	listen, while waiting till it would be time to leave. Her task was
  1568	accomplished.
  1569	
  1570	
  1571	
  1572	
  1573	
  1574	CHAPTER V
  1575	
  1576	âAnd what do you think of this latest comedy, the coronation at
  1577	Milan?â asked Anna PÃ¡vlovna, âand of the comedy of the people of
  1578	Genoa and Lucca laying their petitions before Monsieur Buonaparte, and
  1579	Monsieur Buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of
  1580	the nations? Adorable! It is enough to make oneâs head whirl! It is as
  1581	if the whole world had gone crazy.â
  1582	
  1583	Prince Andrew looked Anna PÃ¡vlovna straight in the face with a
  1584	sarcastic smile.
  1585	
  1586	ââDieu me la donne, gare Ã  qui la touche!ââ * They say he was
  1587	very fine when he said that,â he remarked, repeating the words in
  1588	Italian: ââDio mi lâha dato. Guai a chi la tocchi!ââ
  1589	
  1590	     * God has given it to me, let him who touches it beware!
  1591	
  1592	âI hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run
  1593	over,â Anna PÃ¡vlovna continued. âThe sovereigns will not be able to
  1594	endure this man who is a menace to everything.â
  1595	
  1596	âThe sovereigns? I do not speak of Russia,â said the vicomte, polite
  1597	but hopeless: âThe sovereigns, madame... What have they done for Louis
  1598	XVII, for the Queen, or for Madame Elizabeth? Nothing!â and he became
  1599	more animated. âAnd believe me, they are reaping the reward of their
  1600	betrayal of the Bourbon cause. The sovereigns! Why, they are sending
  1601	ambassadors to compliment the usurper.â
  1602	
  1603	And sighing disdainfully, he again changed his position.
  1604	
  1605	Prince Hippolyte, who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time
  1606	through his lorgnette, suddenly turned completely round toward the
  1607	little princess, and having asked for a needle began tracing the CondÃ©
  1608	coat of arms on the table. He explained this to her with as much gravity
  1609	as if she had asked him to do it.
  1610	
  1611	âBÃ¢ton de gueules, engrÃªlÃ© de gueules dâazurâmaison CondÃ©,â
  1612	said he.
  1613	
  1614	The princess listened, smiling.
  1615	
  1616	âIf Buonaparte remains on the throne of France a year longer,â the
  1617	vicomte continued, with the air of a man who, in a matter with which
  1618	he is better acquainted than anyone else, does not listen to others but
  1619	follows the current of his own thoughts, âthings will have gone too
  1620	far. By intrigues, violence, exile, and executions, French societyâI
  1621	mean good French societyâwill have been forever destroyed, and
  1622	then....â
  1623	
  1624	He shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands. Pierre wished to
  1625	make a remark, for the conversation interested him, but Anna PÃ¡vlovna,
  1626	who had him under observation, interrupted:
  1627	
  1628	âThe Emperor Alexander,â said she, with the melancholy which
  1629	always accompanied any reference of hers to the Imperial family, âhas
  1630	declared that he will leave it to the French people themselves to choose
  1631	their own form of government; and I believe that once free from the
  1632	usurper, the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the arms
  1633	of its rightful king,â she concluded, trying to be amiable to the
  1634	royalist emigrant.
  1635	
  1636	âThat is doubtful,â said Prince Andrew. âMonsieur le Vicomte quite
  1637	rightly supposes that matters have already gone too far. I think it will
  1638	be difficult to return to the old regime.â
  1639	
  1640	âFrom what I have heard,â said Pierre, blushing and breaking into
  1641	the conversation, âalmost all the aristocracy has already gone over to
  1642	Bonaparteâs side.â
  1643	
  1644	âIt is the Buonapartists who say that,â replied the vicomte without
  1645	looking at Pierre. âAt the present time it is difficult to know the
  1646	real state of French public opinion.â
  1647	
  1648	âBonaparte has said so,â remarked Prince Andrew with a sarcastic
  1649	smile.
  1650	
  1651	It was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his
  1652	remarks at him, though without looking at him.
  1653	
  1654	ââI showed them the path to glory, but they did not follow
  1655	it,ââ Prince Andrew continued after a short silence, again quoting
  1656	Napoleonâs words. ââI opened my antechambers and they crowded
  1657	in.â I do not know how far he was justified in saying so.â
  1658	
  1659	âNot in the least,â replied the vicomte. âAfter the murder of the
  1660	duc even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero. If to some
  1661	people,â he went on, turning to Anna PÃ¡vlovna, âhe ever was a hero,
  1662	after the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and one
  1663	hero less on earth.â
  1664	
  1665	Before Anna PÃ¡vlovna and the others had time to smile their
  1666	appreciation of the vicomteâs epigram, Pierre again broke into the
  1667	conversation, and though Anna PÃ¡vlovna felt sure he would say something
  1668	inappropriate, she was unable to stop him.
  1669	
  1670	âThe execution of the Duc dâEnghien,â declared Monsieur Pierre,
  1671	âwas a political necessity, and it seems to me that Napoleon
  1672	showed greatness of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole
  1673	responsibility of that deed.â
  1674	
  1675	âDieu! Mon Dieu!â muttered Anna PÃ¡vlovna in a terrified whisper.
  1676	
  1677	âWhat, Monsieur Pierre... Do you consider that assassination shows
  1678	greatness of soul?â said the little princess, smiling and drawing her
  1679	work nearer to her.
  1680	
  1681	âOh! Oh!â exclaimed several voices.
  1682	
  1683	âCapital!â said Prince Hippolyte in English, and began slapping his
  1684	knee with the palm of his hand.
  1685	
  1686	The vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders. Pierre looked solemnly at his
  1687	audience over his spectacles and continued.
  1688	
  1689	âI say so,â he continued desperately, âbecause the Bourbons fled
  1690	from the Revolution leaving the people to anarchy, and Napoleon alone
  1691	understood the Revolution and quelled it, and so for the general good,
  1692	he could not stop short for the sake of one manâs life.â
  1693	
  1694	âWonât you come over to the other table?â suggested Anna
  1695	PÃ¡vlovna.
  1696	
  1697	But Pierre continued his speech without heeding her.
  1698	
  1699	âNo,â cried he, becoming more and more eager, âNapoleon is great
  1700	because he rose superior to the Revolution, suppressed its abuses,
  1701	preserved all that was good in itâequality of citizenship and freedom
  1702	of speech and of the pressâand only for that reason did he obtain
  1703	power.â
  1704	
  1705	âYes, if having obtained power, without availing himself of it to
  1706	commit murder he had restored it to the rightful king, I should have
  1707	called him a great man,â remarked the vicomte.
  1708	
  1709	âHe could not do that. The people only gave him power that he might
  1710	rid them of the Bourbons and because they saw that he was a great
  1711	man. The Revolution was a grand thing!â continued Monsieur Pierre,
  1712	betraying by this desperate and provocative proposition his extreme
  1713	youth and his wish to express all that was in his mind.
  1714	
  1715	âWhat? Revolution and regicide a grand thing?... Well, after that...
  1716	But wonât you come to this other table?â repeated Anna PÃ¡vlovna.
  1717	
  1718	âRousseauâs Contrat Social,â said the vicomte with a tolerant
  1719	smile.
  1720	
  1721	âI am not speaking of regicide, I am speaking about ideas.â
  1722	
  1723	âYes: ideas of robbery, murder, and regicide,â again interjected an
  1724	ironical voice.
  1725	
  1726	âThose were extremes, no doubt, but they are not what is most
  1727	important. What is important are the rights of man, emancipation from
  1728	prejudices, and equality of citizenship, and all these ideas Napoleon
  1729	has retained in full force.â
  1730	
  1731	âLiberty and equality,â said the vicomte contemptuously, as if at
  1732	last deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words
  1733	were, âhigh-sounding words which have long been discredited. Who does
  1734	not love liberty and equality? Even our Saviour preached liberty and
  1735	equality. Have people since the Revolution become happier? On the
  1736	contrary. We wanted liberty, but Buonaparte has destroyed it.â
  1737	
  1738	Prince Andrew kept looking with an amused smile from Pierre to the
  1739	vicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess. In the first moment of
  1740	Pierreâs outburst Anna PÃ¡vlovna, despite her social experience, was
  1741	horror-struck. But when she saw that Pierreâs sacrilegious words
  1742	had not exasperated the vicomte, and had convinced herself that it was
  1743	impossible to stop him, she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte in
  1744	a vigorous attack on the orator.
  1745	
  1746	âBut, my dear Monsieur Pierre,â said she, âhow do you explain the
  1747	fact of a great man executing a ducâor even an ordinary man whoâis
  1748	innocent and untried?â
  1749	
  1750	âI should like,â said the vicomte, âto ask how monsieur explains
  1751	the 18th Brumaire; was not that an imposture? It was a swindle, and not
  1752	at all like the conduct of a great man!â
  1753	
  1754	âAnd the prisoners he killed in Africa? That was horrible!â said the
  1755	little princess, shrugging her shoulders.
  1756	
  1757	âHeâs a low fellow, say what you will,â remarked Prince Hippolyte.
  1758	
  1759	Pierre, not knowing whom to answer, looked at them all and smiled. His
  1760	smile was unlike the half-smile of other people. When he smiled,
  1761	his grave, even rather gloomy, look was instantaneously replaced by
  1762	anotherâa childlike, kindly, even rather silly look, which seemed to
  1763	ask forgiveness.
  1764	
  1765	The vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that
  1766	this young Jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested. All were
  1767	silent.
  1768	
  1769	âHow do you expect him to answer you all at once?â said Prince
  1770	Andrew. âBesides, in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish
  1771	between his acts as a private person, as a general, and as an emperor.
  1772	So it seems to me.â
  1773	
  1774	âYes, yes, of course!â Pierre chimed in, pleased at the arrival of
  1775	this reinforcement.
  1776	
  1777	âOne must admit,â continued Prince Andrew, âthat Napoleon as a man
  1778	was great on the bridge of Arcola, and in the hospital at Jaffa where he
  1779	gave his hand to the plague-stricken; but ... but there are other acts
  1780	which it is difficult to justify.â
  1781	
  1782	Prince Andrew, who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness of
  1783	Pierreâs remarks, rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to
  1784	go.
  1785	
  1786	Suddenly Prince Hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend,
  1787	and asking them all to be seated began:
  1788	
  1789	âI was told a charming Moscow story today and must treat you to it.
  1790	Excuse me, VicomteâI must tell it in Russian or the point will be
  1791	lost....â And Prince Hippolyte began to tell his story in such Russian
  1792	as a Frenchman would speak after spending about a year in Russia.
  1793	Everyone waited, so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their
  1794	attention to his story.
  1795	
  1796	âThere is in Moscow a lady, une dame, and she is very stingy. She must
  1797	have two footmen behind her carriage, and very big ones. That was her
  1798	taste. And she had a ladyâs maid, also big. She said....â
  1799	
  1800	Here Prince Hippolyte paused, evidently collecting his ideas with
  1801	difficulty.
  1802	
  1803	âShe said.... Oh yes! She said, âGirl,â to the maid, âput on a
  1804	livery, get up behind the carriage, and come with me while I make some
  1805	calls.ââ
  1806	
  1807	Here Prince Hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before his
  1808	audience, which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator. Several
  1809	persons, among them the elderly lady and Anna PÃ¡vlovna, did however
  1810	smile.
  1811	
  1812	âShe went. Suddenly there was a great wind. The girl lost her hat and
  1813	her long hair came down....â Here he could contain himself no
  1814	longer and went on, between gasps of laughter: âAnd the whole world
  1815	knew....â
  1816	
  1817	And so the anecdote ended. Though it was unintelligible why he had told
  1818	it, or why it had to be told in Russian, still Anna PÃ¡vlovna and the
  1819	others appreciated Prince Hippolyteâs social tact in so agreeably
  1820	ending Pierreâs unpleasant and unamiable outburst. After the anecdote
  1821	the conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about the last
  1822	and next balls, about theatricals, and who would meet whom, and when and
  1823	where.
  1824	
  1825	
  1826	
  1827	
  1828	
  1829	CHAPTER VI
  1830	
  1831	Having thanked Anna PÃ¡vlovna for her charming soiree, the guests began
  1832	to take their leave.
  1833	
  1834	Pierre was ungainly. Stout, about the average height, broad, with huge
  1835	red hands; he did not know, as the saying is, how to enter a drawing
  1836	room and still less how to leave one; that is, how to say something
  1837	particularly agreeable before going away. Besides this he was
  1838	absent-minded. When he rose to go, he took up instead of his own, the
  1839	generalâs three-cornered hat, and held it, pulling at the plume,
  1840	till the general asked him to restore it. All his absent-mindedness and
  1841	inability to enter a room and converse in it was, however, redeemed by
  1842	his kindly, simple, and modest expression. Anna PÃ¡vlovna turned toward
  1843	him and, with a Christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of his
  1844	indiscretion, nodded and said: âI hope to see you again, but I also
  1845	hope you will change your opinions, my dear Monsieur Pierre.â
  1846	
  1847	When she said this, he did not reply and only bowed, but again everybody
  1848	saw his smile, which said nothing, unless perhaps, âOpinions are
  1849	opinions, but you see what a capital, good-natured fellow I am.â And
  1850	everyone, including Anna PÃ¡vlovna, felt this.
  1851	
  1852	Prince Andrew had gone out into the hall, and, turning his shoulders
  1853	to the footman who was helping him on with his cloak, listened
  1854	indifferently to his wifeâs chatter with Prince Hippolyte who had also
  1855	come into the hall. Prince Hippolyte stood close to the pretty, pregnant
  1856	princess, and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglass.
  1857	
  1858	âGo in, Annette, or you will catch cold,â said the little princess,
  1859	taking leave of Anna PÃ¡vlovna. âIt is settled,â she added in a low
  1860	voice.
  1861	
  1862	Anna PÃ¡vlovna had already managed to speak to Lise about the match she
  1863	contemplated between Anatole and the little princessâ sister-in-law.
  1864	
  1865	âI rely on you, my dear,â said Anna PÃ¡vlovna, also in a low tone.
  1866	âWrite to her and let me know how her father looks at the matter. Au
  1867	revoir! ââand she left the hall.
  1868	
  1869	Prince Hippolyte approached the little princess and, bending his face
  1870	close to her, began to whisper something.
  1871	
  1872	Two footmen, the princessâ and his own, stood holding a shawl and
  1873	a cloak, waiting for the conversation to finish. They listened to
  1874	the French sentences which to them were meaningless, with an air of
  1875	understanding but not wishing to appear to do so. The princess as usual
  1876	spoke smilingly and listened with a laugh.
  1877	
  1878	âI am very glad I did not go to the ambassadorâs,â said Prince
  1879	Hippolyte ââso dullâ. It has been a delightful evening, has it
  1880	not? Delightful!â
  1881	
  1882	âThey say the ball will be very good,â replied the princess, drawing
  1883	up her downy little lip. âAll the pretty women in society will be
  1884	there.â
  1885	
  1886	âNot all, for you will not be there; not all,â said Prince Hippolyte
  1887	smiling joyfully; and snatching the shawl from the footman, whom he
  1888	even pushed aside, he began wrapping it round the princess. Either from
  1889	awkwardness or intentionally (no one could have said which) after the
  1890	shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long time, as
  1891	though embracing her.
  1892	
  1893	Still smiling, she gracefully moved away, turning and glancing at her
  1894	husband. Prince Andrewâs eyes were closed, so weary and sleepy did he
  1895	seem.
  1896	
  1897	âAre you ready?â he asked his wife, looking past her.
  1898	
  1899	Prince Hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak, which in the latest fashion
  1900	reached to his very heels, and, stumbling in it, ran out into the porch
  1901	following the princess, whom a footman was helping into the carriage.
  1902	
  1903	âPrincesse, au revoir,â cried he, stumbling with his tongue as well
  1904	as with his feet.
  1905	
  1906	The princess, picking up her dress, was taking her seat in the dark
  1907	carriage, her husband was adjusting his saber; Prince Hippolyte, under
  1908	pretense of helping, was in everyoneâs way.
  1909	
  1910	âAllow me, sir,â said Prince Andrew in Russian in a cold,
  1911	disagreeable tone to Prince Hippolyte who was blocking his path.
  1912	
  1913	âI am expecting you, Pierre,â said the same voice, but gently and
  1914	affectionately.
  1915	
  1916	The postilion started, the carriage wheels rattled. Prince Hippolyte
  1917	laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte
  1918	whom he had promised to take home.
  1919	
  1920	âWell, mon cher,â said the vicomte, having seated himself beside
  1921	Hippolyte in the carriage, âyour little princess is very nice, very
  1922	nice indeed, quite French,â and he kissed the tips of his fingers.
  1923	Hippolyte burst out laughing.
  1924	
  1925	âDo you know, you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airs,â
  1926	continued the vicomte. âI pity the poor husband, that little officer
  1927	who gives himself the airs of a monarch.â
  1928	
  1929	Hippolyte spluttered again, and amid his laughter said, âAnd you were
  1930	saying that the Russian ladies are not equal to the French? One has to
  1931	know how to deal with them.â
  1932	
  1933	Pierre reaching the house first went into Prince Andrewâs study like
  1934	one quite at home, and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa, took
  1935	from the shelf the first book that came to his hand (it was Caesarâs
  1936	Commentaries), and resting on his elbow, began reading it in the middle.
  1937	
  1938	âWhat have you done to Mlle SchÃ©rer? She will be quite ill now,â
  1939	said Prince Andrew, as he entered the study, rubbing his small white
  1940	hands.
  1941	
  1942	Pierre turned his whole body, making the sofa creak. He lifted his eager
  1943	face to Prince Andrew, smiled, and waved his hand.
  1944	
  1945	âThat abbÃ© is very interesting but he does not see the thing in the
  1946	right light.... In my opinion perpetual peace is possible butâI do not
  1947	know how to express it ... not by a balance of political power....â
  1948	
  1949	It was evident that Prince Andrew was not interested in such abstract
  1950	conversation.
  1951	
  1952	âOne canât everywhere say all one thinks, mon cher. Well, have
  1953	you at last decided on anything? Are you going to be a guardsman or a
  1954	diplomatist?â asked Prince Andrew after a momentary silence.
  1955	
  1956	Pierre sat up on the sofa, with his legs tucked under him.
  1957	
  1958	âReally, I donât yet know. I donât like either the one or the
  1959	other.â
  1960	
  1961	âBut you must decide on something! Your father expects it.â
  1962	
  1963	Pierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abbÃ© as tutor,
  1964	and had remained away till he was twenty. When he returned to Moscow
  1965	his father dismissed the abbÃ© and said to the young man, âNow go
  1966	to Petersburg, look round, and choose your profession. I will agree to
  1967	anything. Here is a letter to Prince VasÃ­li, and here is money. Write
  1968	to me all about it, and I will help you in everything.â Pierre had
  1969	already been choosing a career for three months, and had not decided
  1970	on anything. It was about this choice that Prince Andrew was speaking.
  1971	Pierre rubbed his forehead.
  1972	
  1973	âBut he must be a Freemason,â said he, referring to the abbÃ© whom
  1974	he had met that evening.
  1975	
  1976	âThat is all nonsense.â Prince Andrew again interrupted him, âlet
  1977	us talk business. Have you been to the Horse Guards?â
  1978	
  1979	âNo, I have not; but this is what I have been thinking and wanted
  1980	to tell you. There is a war now against Napoleon. If it were a war for
  1981	freedom I could understand it and should be the first to enter the army;
  1982	but to help England and Austria against the greatest man in the world is
  1983	not right.â
  1984	
  1985	Prince Andrew only shrugged his shoulders at Pierreâs childish words.
  1986	He put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such
  1987	nonsense, but it would in fact have been difficult to give any other
  1988	answer than the one Prince Andrew gave to this naÃ¯ve question.
  1989	
  1990	âIf no one fought except on his own conviction, there would be no
  1991	wars,â he said.
  1992	
  1993	âAnd that would be splendid,â said Pierre.
  1994	
  1995	Prince Andrew smiled ironically.
  1996	
  1997	âVery likely it would be splendid, but it will never come about....â
  1998	
  1999	âWell, why are you going to the war?â asked Pierre.
  2000	
  2001	âWhat for? I donât know. I must. Besides that I am going....â He
  2002	paused. âI am going because the life I am leading here does not suit
  2003	me!â
  2004	
  2005	
  2006	
  2007	
  2008	
  2009	CHAPTER VII
  2010	
  2011	The rustle of a womanâs dress was heard in the next room. Prince
  2012	Andrew shook himself as if waking up, and his face assumed the look it
  2013	had had in Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs drawing room. Pierre removed his feet from
  2014	the sofa. The princess came in. She had changed her gown for a house
  2015	dress as fresh and elegant as the other. Prince Andrew rose and politely
  2016	placed a chair for her.
  2017	
  2018	âHow is it,â she began, as usual in French, settling down briskly
  2019	and fussily in the easy chair, âhow is it Annette never got married?
  2020	How stupid you men all are not to have married her! Excuse me for saying
  2021	so, but you have no sense about women. What an argumentative fellow you
  2022	are, Monsieur Pierre!â
  2023	
  2024	âAnd I am still arguing with your husband. I canât understand why he
  2025	wants to go to the war,â replied Pierre, addressing the princess
  2026	with none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their
  2027	intercourse with young women.
  2028	
  2029	The princess started. Evidently Pierreâs words touched her to the
  2030	quick.
  2031	
  2032	âAh, that is just what I tell him!â said she. âI donât
  2033	understand it; I donât in the least understand why men canât live
  2034	without wars. How is it that we women donât want anything of the kind,
  2035	donât need it? Now you shall judge between us. I always tell him: Here
  2036	he is Uncleâs aide-de-camp, a most brilliant position. He is so
  2037	well known, so much appreciated by everyone. The other day at the
  2038	AprÃ¡ksinsâ I heard a lady asking, âIs that the famous Prince
  2039	Andrew?â I did indeed.â She laughed. âHe is so well received
  2040	everywhere. He might easily become aide-de-camp to the Emperor. You know
  2041	the Emperor spoke to him most graciously. Annette and I were speaking of
  2042	how to arrange it. What do you think?â
  2043	
  2044	Pierre looked at his friend and, noticing that he did not like the
  2045	conversation, gave no reply.
  2046	
  2047	âWhen are you starting?â he asked.
  2048	
  2049	âOh, donât speak of his going, donât! I wonât hear it spoken
  2050	of,â said the princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which
  2051	she had spoken to Hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly
  2052	ill-suited to the family circle of which Pierre was almost a member.
  2053	âToday when I remembered that all these delightful associations
  2054	must be broken off ... and then you know, AndrÃ©...â (she looked
  2055	significantly at her husband) âIâm afraid, Iâm afraid!â she
  2056	whispered, and a shudder ran down her back.
  2057	
  2058	Her husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone besides
  2059	Pierre and himself was in the room, and addressed her in a tone of
  2060	frigid politeness.
  2061	
  2062	âWhat is it you are afraid of, Lise? I donât understand,â said he.
  2063	
  2064	âThere, what egotists men all are: all, all egotists! Just for a whim
  2065	of his own, goodness only knows why, he leaves me and locks me up alone
  2066	in the country.â
  2067	
  2068	âWith my father and sister, remember,â said Prince Andrew gently.
  2069	
  2070	âAlone all the same, without my friends.... And he expects me not to
  2071	be afraid.â
  2072	
  2073	Her tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up, giving her not a
  2074	joyful, but an animal, squirrel-like expression. She paused as if she
  2075	felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before Pierre, though the
  2076	gist of the matter lay in that.
  2077	
  2078	âI still canât understand what you are afraid of,â said Prince
  2079	Andrew slowly, not taking his eyes off his wife.
  2080	
  2081	The princess blushed, and raised her arms with a gesture of despair.
  2082	
  2083	âNo, Andrew, I must say you have changed. Oh, how you have....â
  2084	
  2085	âYour doctor tells you to go to bed earlier,â said Prince Andrew.
  2086	âYou had better go.â
  2087	
  2088	The princess said nothing, but suddenly her short downy lip quivered.
  2089	Prince Andrew rose, shrugged his shoulders, and walked about the room.
  2090	
  2091	Pierre looked over his spectacles with naÃ¯ve surprise, now at him and
  2092	now at her, moved as if about to rise too, but changed his mind.
  2093	
  2094	âWhy should I mind Monsieur Pierre being here?â exclaimed the little
  2095	princess suddenly, her pretty face all at once distorted by a tearful
  2096	grimace. âI have long wanted to ask you, Andrew, why you have changed
  2097	so to me? What have I done to you? You are going to the war and have no
  2098	pity for me. Why is it?â
  2099	
  2100	âLise!â was all Prince Andrew said. But that one word expressed
  2101	an entreaty, a threat, and above all conviction that she would herself
  2102	regret her words. But she went on hurriedly:
  2103	
  2104	âYou treat me like an invalid or a child. I see it all! Did you behave
  2105	like that six months ago?â
  2106	
  2107	âLise, I beg you to desist,â said Prince Andrew still more
  2108	emphatically.
  2109	
  2110	Pierre, who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened to
  2111	all this, rose and approached the princess. He seemed unable to bear the
  2112	sight of tears and was ready to cry himself.
  2113	
  2114	âCalm yourself, Princess! It seems so to you because.... I assure you
  2115	I myself have experienced ... and so ... because ... No, excuse me!
  2116	An outsider is out of place here.... No, donât distress yourself....
  2117	Good-by!â
  2118	
  2119	Prince Andrew caught him by the hand.
  2120	
  2121	âNo, wait, Pierre! The princess is too kind to wish to deprive me of
  2122	the pleasure of spending the evening with you.â
  2123	
  2124	âNo, he thinks only of himself,â muttered the princess without
  2125	restraining her angry tears.
  2126	
  2127	âLise!â said Prince Andrew dryly, raising his voice to the pitch
  2128	which indicates that patience is exhausted.
  2129	
  2130	Suddenly the angry, squirrel-like expression of the princessâ pretty
  2131	face changed into a winning and piteous look of fear. Her beautiful eyes
  2132	glanced askance at her husbandâs face, and her own assumed the timid,
  2133	deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags its
  2134	drooping tail.
  2135	
  2136	âMon Dieu, mon Dieu!â she muttered, and lifting her dress with one
  2137	hand she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead.
  2138	
  2139	âGood night, Lise,â said he, rising and courteously kissing her hand
  2140	as he would have done to a stranger.
  2141	
  2142	
  2143	
  2144	
  2145	
  2146	CHAPTER VIII
  2147	
  2148	The friends were silent. Neither cared to begin talking. Pierre
  2149	continually glanced at Prince Andrew; Prince Andrew rubbed his forehead
  2150	with his small hand.
  2151	
  2152	âLet us go and have supper,â he said with a sigh, going to the door.
  2153	
  2154	They entered the elegant, newly decorated, and luxurious dining room.
  2155	Everything from the table napkins to the silver, china, and glass bore
  2156	that imprint of newness found in the households of the newly married.
  2157	Halfway through supper Prince Andrew leaned his elbows on the table and,
  2158	with a look of nervous agitation such as Pierre had never before seen on
  2159	his face, began to talkâas one who has long had something on his mind
  2160	and suddenly determines to speak out.
  2161	
  2162	âNever, never marry, my dear fellow! Thatâs my advice: never marry
  2163	till you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of,
  2164	and until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen
  2165	her plainly as she is, or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable
  2166	mistake. Marry when you are old and good for nothingâor all that is
  2167	good and noble in you will be lost. It will all be wasted on trifles.
  2168	Yes! Yes! Yes! Donât look at me with such surprise. If you marry
  2169	expecting anything from yourself in the future, you will feel at every
  2170	step that for you all is ended, all is closed except the drawing
  2171	room, where you will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and an
  2172	idiot!... But whatâs the good?...â and he waved his arm.
  2173	
  2174	Pierre took off his spectacles, which made his face seem different and
  2175	the good-natured expression still more apparent, and gazed at his friend
  2176	in amazement.
  2177	
  2178	âMy wife,â continued Prince Andrew, âis an excellent woman, one
  2179	of those rare women with whom a manâs honor is safe; but, O God, what
  2180	would I not give now to be unmarried! You are the first and only one to
  2181	whom I mention this, because I like you.â
  2182	
  2183	As he said this Prince Andrew was less than ever like that BolkÃ³nski
  2184	who had lolled in Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs easy chairs and with half-closed
  2185	eyes had uttered French phrases between his teeth. Every muscle of his
  2186	thin face was now quivering with nervous excitement; his eyes, in which
  2187	the fire of life had seemed extinguished, now flashed with brilliant
  2188	light. It was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary
  2189	times, the more impassioned he became in these moments of almost morbid
  2190	irritation.
  2191	
  2192	âYou donât understand why I say this,â he continued, âbut it is
  2193	the whole story of life. You talk of Bonaparte and his career,â said
  2194	he (though Pierre had not mentioned Bonaparte), âbut Bonaparte when
  2195	he worked went step by step toward his goal. He was free, he had nothing
  2196	but his aim to consider, and he reached it. But tie yourself up with
  2197	a woman and, like a chained convict, you lose all freedom! And all you
  2198	have of hope and strength merely weighs you down and torments you with
  2199	regret. Drawing rooms, gossip, balls, vanity, and trivialityâthese are
  2200	the enchanted circle I cannot escape from. I am now going to the war,
  2201	the greatest war there ever was, and I know nothing and am fit for
  2202	nothing. I am very amiable and have a caustic wit,â continued Prince
  2203	Andrew, âand at Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs they listen to me. And that stupid
  2204	set without whom my wife cannot exist, and those women.... If you only
  2205	knew what those society women are, and women in general! My father is
  2206	right. Selfish, vain, stupid, trivial in everythingâthatâs what
  2207	women are when you see them in their true colors! When you meet them
  2208	in society it seems as if there were something in them, but thereâs
  2209	nothing, nothing, nothing! No, donât marry, my dear fellow; donât
  2210	marry!â concluded Prince Andrew.
  2211	
  2212	âIt seems funny to me,â said Pierre, âthat you, you should
  2213	consider yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life. You have
  2214	everything before you, everything. And you....â
  2215	
  2216	He did not finish his sentence, but his tone showed how highly he
  2217	thought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the future.
  2218	
  2219	âHow can he talk like that?â thought Pierre. He considered his
  2220	friend a model of perfection because Prince Andrew possessed in the
  2221	highest degree just the very qualities Pierre lacked, and which might
  2222	be best described as strength of will. Pierre was always astonished at
  2223	Prince Andrewâs calm manner of treating everybody, his extraordinary
  2224	memory, his extensive reading (he had read everything, knew everything,
  2225	and had an opinion about everything), but above all at his capacity for
  2226	work and study. And if Pierre was often struck by Andrewâs lack
  2227	of capacity for philosophical meditation (to which he himself was
  2228	particularly addicted), he regarded even this not as a defect but as a
  2229	sign of strength.
  2230	
  2231	Even in the best, most friendly and simplest relations of life, praise
  2232	and commendation are essential, just as grease is necessary to wheels
  2233	that they may run smoothly.
  2234	
  2235	âMy part is played out,â said Prince Andrew. âWhatâs the use of
  2236	talking about me? Let us talk about you,â he added after a silence,
  2237	smiling at his reassuring thoughts.
  2238	
  2239	That smile was immediately reflected on Pierreâs face.
  2240	
  2241	âBut what is there to say about me?â said Pierre, his face relaxing
  2242	into a careless, merry smile. âWhat am I? An illegitimate son!â
  2243	He suddenly blushed crimson, and it was plain that he had made a great
  2244	effort to say this. âWithout a name and without means... And it
  2245	really...â But he did not say what âit reallyâ was. âFor the
  2246	present I am free and am all right. Only I havenât the least idea what
  2247	I am to do; I wanted to consult you seriously.â
  2248	
  2249	Prince Andrew looked kindly at him, yet his glanceâfriendly and
  2250	affectionate as it wasâexpressed a sense of his own superiority.
  2251	
  2252	âI am fond of you, especially as you are the one live man among our
  2253	whole set. Yes, youâre all right! Choose what you will; itâs all the
  2254	same. Youâll be all right anywhere. But look here: give up visiting
  2255	those KurÃ¡gins and leading that sort of life. It suits you so
  2256	badlyâall this debauchery, dissipation, and the rest of it!â
  2257	
  2258	âWhat would you have, my dear fellow?â answered Pierre, shrugging
  2259	his shoulders. âWomen, my dear fellow; women!â
  2260	
  2261	âI donât understand it,â replied Prince Andrew. âWomen who are
  2262	comme il faut, thatâs a different matter; but the KurÃ¡ginsâ set of
  2263	women, âwomen and wineâ I donât understand!â
  2264	
  2265	Pierre was staying at Prince VasÃ­li KurÃ¡ginâs and sharing the
  2266	dissipated life of his son Anatole, the son whom they were planning to
  2267	reform by marrying him to Prince Andrewâs sister.
  2268	
  2269	âDo you know?â said Pierre, as if suddenly struck by a happy
  2270	thought, âseriously, I have long been thinking of it.... Leading such
  2271	a life I canât decide or think properly about anything. Oneâs head
  2272	aches, and one spends all oneâs money. He asked me for tonight, but I
  2273	wonât go.â
  2274	
  2275	âYou give me your word of honor not to go?â
  2276	
  2277	âOn my honor!â
  2278	
  2279	
  2280	
  2281	
  2282	
  2283	CHAPTER IX
  2284	
  2285	It was past one oâclock when Pierre left his friend. It was a
  2286	cloudless, northern, summer night. Pierre took an open cab intending
  2287	to drive straight home. But the nearer he drew to the house the more he
  2288	felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night. It was light
  2289	enough to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like
  2290	morning or evening than night. On the way Pierre remembered that Anatole
  2291	KurÃ¡gin was expecting the usual set for cards that evening, after which
  2292	there was generally a drinking bout, finishing with visits of a kind
  2293	Pierre was very fond of.
  2294	
  2295	âI should like to go to KurÃ¡ginâs,â thought he.
  2296	
  2297	But he immediately recalled his promise to Prince Andrew not to go
  2298	there. Then, as happens to people of weak character, he desired so
  2299	passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to
  2300	that he decided to go. The thought immediately occurred to him that his
  2301	promise to Prince Andrew was of no account, because before he gave it
  2302	he had already promised Prince Anatole to come to his gathering;
  2303	âbesides,â thought he, âall such âwords of honorâ are
  2304	conventional things with no definite meaning, especially if
  2305	one considers that by tomorrow one may be dead, or something so
  2306	extraordinary may happen to one that honor and dishonor will be all the
  2307	same!â Pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort, nullifying
  2308	all his decisions and intentions. He went to KurÃ¡ginâs.
  2309	
  2310	Reaching the large house near the Horse Guardsâ barracks, in which
  2311	Anatole lived, Pierre entered the lighted porch, ascended the stairs,
  2312	and went in at the open door. There was no one in the anteroom; empty
  2313	bottles, cloaks, and overshoes were lying about; there was a smell of
  2314	alcohol, and sounds of voices and shouting in the distance.
  2315	
  2316	Cards and supper were over, but the visitors had not yet dispersed.
  2317	Pierre threw off his cloak and entered the first room, in which were the
  2318	remains of supper. A footman, thinking no one saw him, was drinking on
  2319	the sly what was left in the glasses. From the third room came sounds of
  2320	laughter, the shouting of familiar voices, the growling of a bear, and
  2321	general commotion. Some eight or nine young men were crowding anxiously
  2322	round an open window. Three others were romping with a young bear, one
  2323	pulling him by the chain and trying to set him at the others.
  2324	
  2325	âI bet a hundred on Stevens!â shouted one.
  2326	
  2327	âMind, no holding on!â cried another.
  2328	
  2329	âI bet on DÃ³lokhov!â cried a third. âKurÃ¡gin, you part our
  2330	hands.â
  2331	
  2332	âThere, leave Bruin alone; hereâs a bet on.â
  2333	
  2334	âAt one draught, or he loses!â shouted a fourth.
  2335	
  2336	âJacob, bring a bottle!â shouted the host, a tall, handsome fellow
  2337	who stood in the midst of the group, without a coat, and with his fine
  2338	linen shirt unfastened in front. âWait a bit, you fellows.... Here is
  2339	PÃ©tya! Good man!â cried he, addressing Pierre.
  2340	
  2341	Another voice, from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes,
  2342	particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober
  2343	ring, cried from the window: âCome here; part the bets!â This was
  2344	DÃ³lokhov, an officer of the SemÃ«nov regiment, a notorious gambler and
  2345	duelist, who was living with Anatole. Pierre smiled, looking about him
  2346	merrily.
  2347	
  2348	âI donât understand. Whatâs it all about?â
  2349	
  2350	âWait a bit, he is not drunk yet! A bottle here,â said Anatole, and
  2351	taking a glass from the table he went up to Pierre.
  2352	
  2353	âFirst of all you must drink!â
  2354	
  2355	Pierre drank one glass after another, looking from under his brows at
  2356	the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window, and listening
  2357	to their chatter. Anatole kept on refilling Pierreâs glass while
  2358	explaining that DÃ³lokhov was betting with Stevens, an English naval
  2359	officer, that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledge
  2360	of the third floor window with his legs hanging out.
  2361	
  2362	âGo on, you must drink it all,â said Anatole, giving Pierre the last
  2363	glass, âor I wonât let you go!â
  2364	
  2365	âNo, I wonât,â said Pierre, pushing Anatole aside, and he went up
  2366	to the window.
  2367	
  2368	DÃ³lokhov was holding the Englishmanâs hand and clearly and distinctly
  2369	repeating the terms of the bet, addressing himself particularly to
  2370	Anatole and Pierre.
  2371	
  2372	DÃ³lokhov was of medium height, with curly hair and light-blue eyes. He
  2373	was about twenty-five. Like all infantry officers he wore no mustache,
  2374	so that his mouth, the most striking feature of his face, was clearly
  2375	seen. The lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved. The middle
  2376	of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm
  2377	lower one, and something like two distinct smiles played continually
  2378	round the two corners of the mouth; this, together with the resolute,
  2379	insolent intelligence of his eyes, produced an effect which made it
  2380	impossible not to notice his face. DÃ³lokhov was a man of small means
  2381	and no connections. Yet, though Anatole spent tens of thousands of
  2382	rubles, DÃ³lokhov lived with him and had placed himself on such a
  2383	footing that all who knew them, including Anatole himself, respected him
  2384	more than they did Anatole. DÃ³lokhov could play all games and nearly
  2385	always won. However much he drank, he never lost his clearheadedness.
  2386	Both KurÃ¡gin and DÃ³lokhov were at that time notorious among the rakes
  2387	and scapegraces of Petersburg.
  2388	
  2389	The bottle of rum was brought. The window frame which prevented anyone
  2390	from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen, who
  2391	were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts of
  2392	the gentlemen around.
  2393	
  2394	Anatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window. He wanted to
  2395	smash something. Pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame, but
  2396	could not move it. He smashed a pane.
  2397	
  2398	âYou have a try, Hercules,â said he, turning to Pierre.
  2399	
  2400	Pierre seized the crossbeam, tugged, and wrenched the oak frame out with
  2401	a crash.
  2402	
  2403	âTake it right out, or theyâll think Iâm holding on,â said
  2404	DÃ³lokhov.
  2405	
  2406	âIs the Englishman bragging?... Eh? Is it all right?â said Anatole.
  2407	
  2408	âFirst-rate,â said Pierre, looking at DÃ³lokhov, who with a bottle
  2409	of rum in his hand was approaching the window, from which the light of
  2410	the sky, the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset, was visible.
  2411	
  2412	DÃ³lokhov, the bottle of rum still in his hand, jumped onto the window
  2413	sill. âListen!â cried he, standing there and addressing those in the
  2414	room. All were silent.
  2415	
  2416	âI bet fifty imperialsââhe spoke French that the Englishman might
  2417	understand him, but he did not speak it very wellââI bet fifty
  2418	imperials ... or do you wish to make it a hundred?â added he,
  2419	addressing the Englishman.
  2420	
  2421	âNo, fifty,â replied the latter.
  2422	
  2423	âAll right. Fifty imperials ... that I will drink a whole bottle of
  2424	rum without taking it from my mouth, sitting outside the window on this
  2425	spotâ (he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the window)
  2426	âand without holding on to anything. Is that right?â
  2427	
  2428	âQuite right,â said the Englishman.
  2429	
  2430	Anatole turned to the Englishman and taking him by one of the buttons
  2431	of his coat and looking down at himâthe Englishman was shortâbegan
  2432	repeating the terms of the wager to him in English.
  2433	
  2434	âWait!â cried DÃ³lokhov, hammering with the bottle on the window
  2435	sill to attract attention. âWait a bit, KurÃ¡gin. Listen! If
  2436	anyone else does the same, I will pay him a hundred imperials. Do you
  2437	understand?â
  2438	
  2439	The Englishman nodded, but gave no indication whether he intended to
  2440	accept this challenge or not. Anatole did not release him, and though
  2441	he kept nodding to show that he understood, Anatole went on translating
  2442	DÃ³lokhovâs words into English. A thin young lad, an hussar of the
  2443	Life Guards, who had been losing that evening, climbed on the window
  2444	sill, leaned over, and looked down.
  2445	
  2446	âOh! Oh! Oh!â he muttered, looking down from the window at the
  2447	stones of the pavement.
  2448	
  2449	âShut up!â cried DÃ³lokhov, pushing him away from the window. The
  2450	lad jumped awkwardly back into the room, tripping over his spurs.
  2451	
  2452	Placing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it easily,
  2453	DÃ³lokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered
  2454	his legs. Pressing against both sides of the window, he adjusted himself
  2455	on his seat, lowered his hands, moved a little to the right and then to
  2456	the left, and took up the bottle. Anatole brought two candles and
  2457	placed them on the window sill, though it was already quite light.
  2458	DÃ³lokhovâs back in his white shirt, and his curly head, were lit
  2459	up from both sides. Everyone crowded to the window, the Englishman in
  2460	front. Pierre stood smiling but silent. One man, older than the others
  2461	present, suddenly pushed forward with a scared and angry look and wanted
  2462	to seize hold of DÃ³lokhovâs shirt.
  2463	
  2464	âI say, this is folly! Heâll be killed,â said this more sensible
  2465	man.
  2466	
  2467	Anatole stopped him.
  2468	
  2469	âDonât touch him! Youâll startle him and then heâll be killed.
  2470	Eh?... What then?... Eh?â
  2471	
  2472	DÃ³lokhov turned round and, again holding on with both hands, arranged
  2473	himself on his seat.
  2474	
  2475	âIf anyone comes meddling again,â said he, emitting the words
  2476	separately through his thin compressed lips, âI will throw him down
  2477	there. Now then!â
  2478	
  2479	Saying this he again turned round, dropped his hands, took the bottle
  2480	and lifted it to his lips, threw back his head, and raised his free hand
  2481	to balance himself. One of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some
  2482	broken glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from the
  2483	window and from DÃ³lokhovâs back. Anatole stood erect with staring
  2484	eyes. The Englishman looked on sideways, pursing up his lips. The man
  2485	who had wished to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threw
  2486	himself on a sofa with his face to the wall. Pierre hid his face, from
  2487	which a faint smile forgot to fade though his features now expressed
  2488	horror and fear. All were still. Pierre took his hands from his eyes.
  2489	DÃ³lokhov still sat in the same position, only his head was thrown
  2490	further back till his curly hair touched his shirt collar, and the hand
  2491	holding the bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with the
  2492	effort. The bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher
  2493	and his head tilting yet further back. âWhy is it so long?â thought
  2494	Pierre. It seemed to him that more than half an hour had elapsed.
  2495	Suddenly DÃ³lokhov made a backward movement with his spine, and his arm
  2496	trembled nervously; this was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip
  2497	as he sat on the sloping ledge. As he began slipping down, his head and
  2498	arm wavered still more with the strain. One hand moved as if to clutch
  2499	the window sill, but refrained from touching it. Pierre again covered
  2500	his eyes and thought he would never open them again. Suddenly he was
  2501	aware of a stir all around. He looked up: DÃ³lokhov was standing on the
  2502	window sill, with a pale but radiant face.
  2503	
  2504	âItâs empty.â
  2505	
  2506	He threw the bottle to the Englishman, who caught it neatly. DÃ³lokhov
  2507	jumped down. He smelt strongly of rum.
  2508	
  2509	âWell done!... Fine fellow!... Thereâs a bet for you!... Devil take
  2510	you!â came from different sides.
  2511	
  2512	The Englishman took out his purse and began counting out the money.
  2513	DÃ³lokhov stood frowning and did not speak. Pierre jumped upon the
  2514	window sill.
  2515	
  2516	âGentlemen, who wishes to bet with me? Iâll do the same thing!â
  2517	he suddenly cried. âEven without a bet, there! Tell them to bring me a
  2518	bottle. Iâll do it.... Bring a bottle!â
  2519	
  2520	âLet him do it, let him do it,â said DÃ³lokhov, smiling.
  2521	
  2522	âWhat next? Have you gone mad?... No one would let you!... Why, you go
  2523	giddy even on a staircase,â exclaimed several voices.
  2524	
  2525	âIâll drink it! Letâs have a bottle of rum!â shouted Pierre,
  2526	banging the table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to
  2527	climb out of the window.
  2528	
  2529	They seized him by his arms; but he was so strong that everyone who
  2530	touched him was sent flying.
  2531	
  2532	âNo, youâll never manage him that way,â said Anatole. âWait a
  2533	bit and Iâll get round him.... Listen! Iâll take your bet tomorrow,
  2534	but now we are all going to âââs.â
  2535	
  2536	âCome on then,â cried Pierre. âCome on!... And weâll take Bruin
  2537	with us.â
  2538	
  2539	And he caught the bear, took it in his arms, lifted it from the ground,
  2540	and began dancing round the room with it.
  2541	
  2542	
  2543	
  2544

  2546	CHAPTER X
  2547	
  2548	Prince VasÃ­li kept the promise he had given to Princess DrubetskÃ¡ya
  2549	who had spoken to him on behalf of her only son BorÃ­s on the evening of
  2550	Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs soiree. The matter was mentioned to the Emperor, an
  2551	exception made, and BorÃ­s transferred into the regiment of SemÃ«nov
  2552	Guards with the rank of cornet. He received, however, no appointment
  2553	to KutÃºzovâs staff despite all Anna MikhÃ¡ylovnaâs endeavors and
  2554	entreaties. Soon after Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs reception Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna
  2555	returned to Moscow and went straight to her rich relations, the
  2556	RostÃ³vs, with whom she stayed when in the town and where her darling
  2557	BÃ³ry, who had only just entered a regiment of the line and was being
  2558	at once transferred to the Guards as a cornet, had been educated from
  2559	childhood and lived for years at a time. The Guards had already left
  2560	Petersburg on the tenth of August, and her son, who had remained in
  2561	Moscow for his equipment, was to join them on the march to RadzivÃ­lov.
  2562	
  2563	It was St. Nataliaâs day and the name day of two of the RostÃ³vsâthe
  2564	mother and the youngest daughterâboth named Nataly. Ever since
  2565	the morning, carriages with six horses had been coming and going
  2566	continually, bringing visitors to the Countess RostÃ³vaâs big house on
  2567	the PovarskÃ¡ya, so well known to all Moscow. The countess herself and
  2568	her handsome eldest daughter were in the drawing room with the visitors
  2569	who came to congratulate, and who constantly succeeded one another in
  2570	relays.
  2571	
  2572	The countess was a woman of about forty-five, with a thin Oriental type
  2573	of face, evidently worn out with childbearingâshe had had twelve.
  2574	A languor of motion and speech, resulting from weakness, gave her a
  2575	distinguished air which inspired respect. Princess Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna
  2576	DrubetskÃ¡ya, who as a member of the household was also seated in the
  2577	drawing room, helped to receive and entertain the visitors. The young
  2578	people were in one of the inner rooms, not considering it necessary to
  2579	take part in receiving the visitors. The count met the guests and saw
  2580	them off, inviting them all to dinner.
  2581	
  2582	âI am very, very grateful to you, mon cher,â or âma chÃ¨reââhe
  2583	called everyone without exception and without the slightest variation
  2584	in his tone, âmy dear,â whether they were above or below him in
  2585	rankââI thank you for myself and for our two dear ones whose name
  2586	day we are keeping. But mind you come to dinner or I shall be offended,
  2587	ma chÃ¨re! On behalf of the whole family I beg you to come, mon cher!â
  2588	These words he repeated to everyone without exception or variation, and
  2589	with the same expression on his full, cheerful, clean-shaven face, the
  2590	same firm pressure of the hand and the same quick, repeated bows. As
  2591	soon as he had seen a visitor off he returned to one of those who were
  2592	still in the drawing room, drew a chair toward him or her, and jauntily
  2593	spreading out his legs and putting his hands on his knees with the air
  2594	of a man who enjoys life and knows how to live, he swayed to and
  2595	fro with dignity, offered surmises about the weather, or touched on
  2596	questions of health, sometimes in Russian and sometimes in very bad but
  2597	self-confident French; then again, like a man weary but unflinching in
  2598	the fulfillment of duty, he rose to see some visitors off and, stroking
  2599	his scanty gray hairs over his bald patch, also asked them to dinner.
  2600	Sometimes on his way back from the anteroom he would pass through the
  2601	conservatory and pantry into the large marble dining hall, where tables
  2602	were being set out for eighty people; and looking at the footmen, who
  2603	were bringing in silver and china, moving tables, and unfolding damask
  2604	table linen, he would call DmÃ­tri VasÃ­levich, a man of good family and
  2605	the manager of all his affairs, and while looking with pleasure at the
  2606	enormous table would say: âWell, DmÃ­tri, youâll see that things are
  2607	all as they should be? Thatâs right! The great thing is the serving,
  2608	thatâs it.â And with a complacent sigh he would return to the
  2609	drawing room.
  2610	
  2611	âMÃ¡rya LvÃ³vna KarÃ¡gina and her daughter!â announced the
  2612	countessâ gigantic footman in his bass voice, entering the drawing
  2613	room. The countess reflected a moment and took a pinch from a gold
  2614	snuffbox with her husbandâs portrait on it.
  2615	
  2616	âIâm quite worn out by these callers. However, Iâll see her and
  2617	no more. She is so affected. Ask her in,â she said to the footman in a
  2618	sad voice, as if saying: âVery well, finish me off.â
  2619	
  2620	A tall, stout, and proud-looking woman, with a round-faced smiling
  2621	daughter, entered the drawing room, their dresses rustling.
  2622	
  2623	âDear Countess, what an age... She has been laid up, poor child ...
  2624	at the RazumÃ³vskiâs ball ... and Countess AprÃ¡ksina ... I was
  2625	so delighted...â came the sounds of animated feminine voices,
  2626	interrupting one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses and
  2627	the scraping of chairs. Then one of those conversations began which last
  2628	out until, at the first pause, the guests rise with a rustle of dresses
  2629	and say, âI am so delighted... Mammaâs health... and Countess
  2630	AprÃ¡ksina...â and then, again rustling, pass into the anteroom, put
  2631	on cloaks or mantles, and drive away. The conversation was on the chief
  2632	topic of the day: the illness of the wealthy and celebrated beau of
  2633	Catherineâs day, Count BezÃºkhov, and about his illegitimate son
  2634	Pierre, the one who had behaved so improperly at Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs
  2635	reception.
  2636	
  2637	âI am so sorry for the poor count,â said the visitor. âHe is in
  2638	such bad health, and now this vexation about his son is enough to kill
  2639	him!â
  2640	
  2641	âWhat is that?â asked the countess as if she did not know what the
  2642	visitor alluded to, though she had already heard about the cause of
  2643	Count BezÃºkhovâs distress some fifteen times.
  2644	
  2645	âThatâs what comes of a modern education,â exclaimed the visitor.
  2646	âIt seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do
  2647	as he liked, now in Petersburg I hear he has been doing such terrible
  2648	things that he has been expelled by the police.â
  2649	
  2650	âYou donât say so!â replied the countess.
  2651	
  2652	âHe chose his friends badly,â interposed Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna.
  2653	âPrince VasÃ­liâs son, he, and a certain DÃ³lokhov have, it is said,
  2654	been up to heaven only knows what! And they have had to suffer for it.
  2655	DÃ³lokhov has been degraded to the ranks and BezÃºkhovâs son sent
  2656	back to Moscow. Anatole KurÃ¡ginâs father managed somehow to get his
  2657	sonâs affair hushed up, but even he was ordered out of Petersburg.â
  2658	
  2659	âBut what have they been up to?â asked the countess.
  2660	
  2661	âThey are regular brigands, especially DÃ³lokhov,â replied the
  2662	visitor. âHe is a son of MÃ¡rya IvÃ¡novna DÃ³lokhova, such a worthy
  2663	woman, but there, just fancy! Those three got hold of a bear somewhere,
  2664	put it in a carriage, and set off with it to visit some actresses! The
  2665	police tried to interfere, and what did the young men do? They tied
  2666	a policeman and the bear back to back and put the bear into the Moyka
  2667	Canal. And there was the bear swimming about with the policeman on his
  2668	back!â
  2669	
  2670	âWhat a nice figure the policeman must have cut, my dear!â shouted
  2671	the count, dying with laughter.
  2672	
  2673	âOh, how dreadful! How can you laugh at it, Count?â
  2674	
  2675	Yet the ladies themselves could not help laughing.
  2676	
  2677	âIt was all they could do to rescue the poor man,â continued the
  2678	visitor. âAnd to think it is Cyril VladÃ­mirovich BezÃºkhovâs son
  2679	who amuses himself in this sensible manner! And he was said to be so
  2680	well educated and clever. This is all that his foreign education has
  2681	done for him! I hope that here in Moscow no one will receive him, in
  2682	spite of his money. They wanted to introduce him to me, but I quite
  2683	declined: I have my daughters to consider.â
  2684	
  2685	âWhy do you say this young man is so rich?â asked the countess,
  2686	turning away from the girls, who at once assumed an air of inattention.
  2687	âHis children are all illegitimate. I think Pierre also is
  2688	illegitimate.â
  2689	
  2690	The visitor made a gesture with her hand.
  2691	
  2692	âI should think he has a score of them.â
  2693	
  2694	Princess Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna intervened in the conversation, evidently
  2695	wishing to show her connections and knowledge of what went on in
  2696	society.
  2697	
  2698	âThe fact of the matter is,â said she significantly, and also in a
  2699	half whisper, âeveryone knows Count Cyrilâs reputation.... He has
  2700	lost count of his children, but this Pierre was his favorite.â
  2701	
  2702	âHow handsome the old man still was only a year ago!â remarked the
  2703	countess. âI have never seen a handsomer man.â
  2704	
  2705	âHe is very much altered now,â said Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna. âWell, as
  2706	I was saying, Prince VasÃ­li is the next heir through his wife, but the
  2707	count is very fond of Pierre, looked after his education, and wrote to
  2708	the Emperor about him; so that in the case of his deathâand he is
  2709	so ill that he may die at any moment, and Dr. Lorrain has come from
  2710	Petersburgâno one knows who will inherit his immense fortune, Pierre
  2711	or Prince VasÃ­li. Forty thousand serfs and millions of rubles! I know
  2712	it all very well for Prince VasÃ­li told me himself. Besides, Cyril
  2713	VladÃ­mirovich is my motherâs second cousin. Heâs also my BÃ³ryâs
  2714	godfather,â she added, as if she attached no importance at all to the
  2715	fact.
  2716	
  2717	âPrince VasÃ­li arrived in Moscow yesterday. I hear he has come on
  2718	some inspection business,â remarked the visitor.
  2719	
  2720	âYes, but between ourselves,â said the princess, âthat is a
  2721	pretext. The fact is he has come to see Count Cyril VladÃ­mirovich,
  2722	hearing how ill he is.â
  2723	
  2724	âBut do you know, my dear, that was a capital joke,â said the count;
  2725	and seeing that the elder visitor was not listening, he turned to the
  2726	young ladies. âI can just imagine what a funny figure that policeman
  2727	cut!â
  2728	
  2729	And as he waved his arms to impersonate the policeman, his portly form
  2730	again shook with a deep ringing laugh, the laugh of one who always eats
  2731	well and, in particular, drinks well. âSo do come and dine with us!â
  2732	he said.
  2733	
  2734	
  2735	
  2736	
  2737	
  2738	CHAPTER XI
  2739	
  2740	Silence ensued. The countess looked at her callers, smiling affably,
  2741	but not concealing the fact that she would not be distressed if they
  2742	now rose and took their leave. The visitorâs daughter was already
  2743	smoothing down her dress with an inquiring look at her mother, when
  2744	suddenly from the next room were heard the footsteps of boys and girls
  2745	running to the door and the noise of a chair falling over, and a girl
  2746	of thirteen, hiding something in the folds of her short muslin frock,
  2747	darted in and stopped short in the middle of the room. It was evident
  2748	that she had not intended her flight to bring her so far. Behind her in
  2749	the doorway appeared a student with a crimson coat collar, an officer
  2750	of the Guards, a girl of fifteen, and a plump rosy-faced boy in a short
  2751	jacket.
  2752	
  2753	The count jumped up and, swaying from side to side, spread his arms wide
  2754	and threw them round the little girl who had run in.
  2755	
  2756	âAh, here she is!â he exclaimed laughing. âMy pet, whose name day
  2757	it is. My dear pet!â
  2758	
  2759	âMa chÃ¨re, there is a time for everything,â said the countess with
  2760	feigned severity. âYou spoil her, IlyÃ¡,â she added, turning to her
  2761	husband.
  2762	
  2763	âHow do you do, my dear? I wish you many happy returns of your name
  2764	day,â said the visitor. âWhat a charming child,â she added,
  2765	addressing the mother.
  2766	
  2767	This black-eyed, wide-mouthed girl, not pretty but full of lifeâwith
  2768	childish bare shoulders which after her run heaved and shook her
  2769	bodice, with black curls tossed backward, thin bare arms, little legs
  2770	in lace-frilled drawers, and feet in low slippersâwas just at that
  2771	charming age when a girl is no longer a child, though the child is not
  2772	yet a young woman. Escaping from her father she ran to hide her flushed
  2773	face in the lace of her motherâs mantillaânot paying the least
  2774	attention to her severe remarkâand began to laugh. She laughed, and in
  2775	fragmentary sentences tried to explain about a doll which she produced
  2776	from the folds of her frock.
  2777	
  2778	âDo you see?... My doll... Mimi... You see...â was all NatÃ¡sha
  2779	managed to utter (to her everything seemed funny). She leaned against
  2780	her mother and burst into such a loud, ringing fit of laughter that even
  2781	the prim visitor could not help joining in.
  2782	
  2783	âNow then, go away and take your monstrosity with you,â said the
  2784	mother, pushing away her daughter with pretended sternness, and turning
  2785	to the visitor she added: âShe is my youngest girl.â
  2786	
  2787	NatÃ¡sha, raising her face for a moment from her motherâs mantilla,
  2788	glanced up at her through tears of laughter, and again hid her face.
  2789	
  2790	The visitor, compelled to look on at this family scene, thought it
  2791	necessary to take some part in it.
  2792	
  2793	âTell me, my dear,â said she to NatÃ¡sha, âis Mimi a relation of
  2794	yours? A daughter, I suppose?â
  2795	
  2796	NatÃ¡sha did not like the visitorâs tone of condescension to childish
  2797	things. She did not reply, but looked at her seriously.
  2798	
  2799	Meanwhile the younger generation: BorÃ­s, the officer, Anna
  2800	MikhÃ¡ylovnaâs son; Nicholas, the undergraduate, the countâs eldest
  2801	son; SÃ³nya, the countâs fifteen-year-old niece, and little PÃ©tya,
  2802	his youngest boy, had all settled down in the drawing room and were
  2803	obviously trying to restrain within the bounds of decorum the excitement
  2804	and mirth that shone in all their faces. Evidently in the back rooms,
  2805	from which they had dashed out so impetuously, the conversation had
  2806	been more amusing than the drawing room talk of society scandals, the
  2807	weather, and Countess AprÃ¡ksina. Now and then they glanced at one
  2808	another, hardly able to suppress their laughter.
  2809	
  2810	The two young men, the student and the officer, friends from childhood,
  2811	were of the same age and both handsome fellows, though not alike. BorÃ­s
  2812	was tall and fair, and his calm and handsome face had regular, delicate
  2813	features. Nicholas was short with curly hair and an open expression.
  2814	Dark hairs were already showing on his upper lip, and his whole face
  2815	expressed impetuosity and enthusiasm. Nicholas blushed when he entered
  2816	the drawing room. He evidently tried to find something to say, but
  2817	failed. BorÃ­s on the contrary at once found his footing, and related
  2818	quietly and humorously how he had known that doll Mimi when she was
  2819	still quite a young lady, before her nose was broken; how she had aged
  2820	during the five years he had known her, and how her head had cracked
  2821	right across the skull. Having said this he glanced at NatÃ¡sha.
  2822	She turned away from him and glanced at her younger brother, who was
  2823	screwing up his eyes and shaking with suppressed laughter, and unable
  2824	to control herself any longer, she jumped up and rushed from the room as
  2825	fast as her nimble little feet would carry her. BorÃ­s did not laugh.
  2826	
  2827	âYou were meaning to go out, werenât you, Mamma? Do you want the
  2828	carriage?â he asked his mother with a smile.
  2829	
  2830	âYes, yes, go and tell them to get it ready,â she answered,
  2831	returning his smile.
  2832	
  2833	BorÃ­s quietly left the room and went in search of NatÃ¡sha. The plump
  2834	boy ran after them angrily, as if vexed that their program had been
  2835	disturbed.
  2836	
  2837	
  2838	
  2839	
  2840	
  2841	CHAPTER XII
  2842	
  2843	The only young people remaining in the drawing room, not counting the
  2844	young lady visitor and the countessâ eldest daughter (who was four
  2845	years older than her sister and behaved already like a grown-up person),
  2846	were Nicholas and SÃ³nya, the niece. SÃ³nya was a slender little
  2847	brunette with a tender look in her eyes which were veiled by long
  2848	lashes, thick black plaits coiling twice round her head, and a tawny
  2849	tint in her complexion and especially in the color of her slender but
  2850	graceful and muscular arms and neck. By the grace of her movements,
  2851	by the softness and flexibility of her small limbs, and by a certain
  2852	coyness and reserve of manner, she reminded one of a pretty, half-grown
  2853	kitten which promises to become a beautiful little cat. She evidently
  2854	considered it proper to show an interest in the general conversation by
  2855	smiling, but in spite of herself her eyes under their thick long lashes
  2856	watched her cousin who was going to join the army, with such passionate
  2857	girlish adoration that her smile could not for a single instant impose
  2858	upon anyone, and it was clear that the kitten had settled down only to
  2859	spring up with more energy and again play with her cousin as soon as
  2860	they too could, like NatÃ¡sha and BorÃ­s, escape from the drawing room.
  2861	
  2862	âAh yes, my dear,â said the count, addressing the visitor and
  2863	pointing to Nicholas, âhis friend BorÃ­s has become an officer, and
  2864	so for friendshipâs sake he is leaving the university and me, his
  2865	old father, and entering the military service, my dear. And there was a
  2866	place and everything waiting for him in the Archives Department! Isnât
  2867	that friendship?â remarked the count in an inquiring tone.
  2868	
  2869	âBut they say that war has been declared,â replied the visitor.
  2870	
  2871	âTheyâve been saying so a long while,â said the count, âand
  2872	theyâll say so again and again, and that will be the end of it. My
  2873	dear, thereâs friendship for you,â he repeated. âHeâs joining
  2874	the hussars.â
  2875	
  2876	The visitor, not knowing what to say, shook her head.
  2877	
  2878	âItâs not at all from friendship,â declared Nicholas, flaring
  2879	up and turning away as if from a shameful aspersion. âIt is not from
  2880	friendship at all; I simply feel that the army is my vocation.â
  2881	
  2882	He glanced at his cousin and the young lady visitor; and they were both
  2883	regarding him with a smile of approbation.
  2884	
  2885	âSchubert, the colonel of the PÃ¡vlograd Hussars, is dining with us
  2886	today. He has been here on leave and is taking Nicholas back with him.
  2887	It canât be helped!â said the count, shrugging his shoulders and
  2888	speaking playfully of a matter that evidently distressed him.
  2889	
  2890	âI have already told you, Papa,â said his son, âthat if you
  2891	donât wish to let me go, Iâll stay. But I know I am no use anywhere
  2892	except in the army; I am not a diplomat or a government clerk.âI
  2893	donât know how to hide what I feel.â As he spoke he kept glancing
  2894	with the flirtatiousness of a handsome youth at SÃ³nya and the young
  2895	lady visitor.
  2896	
  2897	The little kitten, feasting her eyes on him, seemed ready at any moment
  2898	to start her gambols again and display her kittenish nature.
  2899	
  2900	âAll right, all right!â said the old count. âHe always flares up!
  2901	This Buonaparte has turned all their heads; they all think of how he
  2902	rose from an ensign and became Emperor. Well, well, God grant it,â he
  2903	added, not noticing his visitorâs sarcastic smile.
  2904	
  2905	The elders began talking about Bonaparte. Julie KarÃ¡gina turned to
  2906	young RostÃ³v.
  2907	
  2908	âWhat a pity you werenât at the ArkhÃ¡rovsâ on Thursday. It was so
  2909	dull without you,â said she, giving him a tender smile.
  2910	
  2911	The young man, flattered, sat down nearer to her with a coquettish
  2912	smile, and engaged the smiling Julie in a confidential conversation
  2913	without at all noticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the heart
  2914	of SÃ³nya, who blushed and smiled unnaturally. In the midst of his talk
  2915	he glanced round at her. She gave him a passionately angry glance, and
  2916	hardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the artificial smile
  2917	on her lips, she got up and left the room. All Nicholasâ animation
  2918	vanished. He waited for the first pause in the conversation, and then
  2919	with a distressed face left the room to find SÃ³nya.
  2920	
  2921	âHow plainly all these young people wear their hearts on their
  2922	sleeves!â said Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, pointing to Nicholas as he went out.
  2923	âCousinageâdangereux voisinage,â * she added.
  2924	
  2925	     * Cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood.
  2926	
  2927	âYes,â said the countess when the brightness these young people had
  2928	brought into the room had vanished; and as if answering a question no
  2929	one had put but which was always in her mind, âand how much suffering,
  2930	how much anxiety one has had to go through that we might rejoice in
  2931	them now! And yet really the anxiety is greater now than the joy. One is
  2932	always, always anxious! Especially just at this age, so dangerous both
  2933	for girls and boys.â
  2934	
  2935	âIt all depends on the bringing up,â remarked the visitor.
  2936	
  2937	âYes, youâre quite right,â continued the countess. âTill now I
  2938	have always, thank God, been my childrenâs friend and had their full
  2939	confidence,â said she, repeating the mistake of so many parents who
  2940	imagine that their children have no secrets from them. âI know I shall
  2941	always be my daughtersâ first confidante, and that if Nicholas, with
  2942	his impulsive nature, does get into mischief (a boy canât help it), he
  2943	will all the same never be like those Petersburg young men.â
  2944	
  2945	âYes, they are splendid, splendid youngsters,â chimed in the count,
  2946	who always solved questions that seemed to him perplexing by deciding
  2947	that everything was splendid. âJust fancy: wants to be an hussar.
  2948	Whatâs one to do, my dear?â
  2949	
  2950	âWhat a charming creature your younger girl is,â said the visitor;
  2951	âa little volcano!â
  2952	
  2953	âYes, a regular volcano,â said the count. âTakes after me! And
  2954	what a voice she has; though sheâs my daughter, I tell the truth
  2955	when I say sheâll be a singer, a second Salomoni! We have engaged an
  2956	Italian to give her lessons.â
  2957	
  2958	âIsnât she too young? I have heard that it harms the voice to train
  2959	it at that age.â
  2960	
  2961	âOh no, not at all too young!â replied the count. âWhy, our
  2962	mothers used to be married at twelve or thirteen.â
  2963	
  2964	âAnd sheâs in love with BorÃ­s already. Just fancy!â said the
  2965	countess with a gentle smile, looking at BorÃ­s and went on, evidently
  2966	concerned with a thought that always occupied her: âNow you see if I
  2967	were to be severe with her and to forbid it ... goodness knows what they
  2968	might be up to on the slyâ (she meant that they would be kissing),
  2969	âbut as it is, I know every word she utters. She will come running to
  2970	me of her own accord in the evening and tell me everything. Perhaps I
  2971	spoil her, but really that seems the best plan. With her elder sister I
  2972	was stricter.â
  2973	
  2974	âYes, I was brought up quite differently,â remarked the handsome
  2975	elder daughter, Countess VÃ©ra, with a smile.
  2976	
  2977	But the smile did not enhance VÃ©raâs beauty as smiles generally do;
  2978	on the contrary it gave her an unnatural, and therefore unpleasant,
  2979	expression. VÃ©ra was good-looking, not at all stupid, quick at
  2980	learning, was well brought up, and had a pleasant voice; what she said
  2981	was true and appropriate, yet, strange to say, everyoneâthe visitors
  2982	and countess alikeâturned to look at her as if wondering why she had
  2983	said it, and they all felt awkward.
  2984	
  2985	âPeople are always too clever with their eldest children and try to
  2986	make something exceptional of them,â said the visitor.
  2987	
  2988	âWhatâs the good of denying it, my dear? Our dear countess was too
  2989	clever with VÃ©ra,â said the count. âWell, what of that? Sheâs
  2990	turned out splendidly all the same,â he added, winking at VÃ©ra.
  2991	
  2992	The guests got up and took their leave, promising to return to dinner.
  2993	
  2994	âWhat manners! I thought they would never go,â said the countess,
  2995	when she had seen her guests out.
  2996	
  2997	
  2998	
  2999	
  3000	
  3001	CHAPTER XIII
  3002	
  3003	When NatÃ¡sha ran out of the drawing room she only went as far as the
  3004	conservatory. There she paused and stood listening to the conversation
  3005	in the drawing room, waiting for BorÃ­s to come out. She was already
  3006	growing impatient, and stamped her foot, ready to cry at his not coming
  3007	at once, when she heard the young manâs discreet steps approaching
  3008	neither quickly nor slowly. At this NatÃ¡sha dashed swiftly among the
  3009	flower tubs and hid there.
  3010	
  3011	BorÃ­s paused in the middle of the room, looked round, brushed a little
  3012	dust from the sleeve of his uniform, and going up to a mirror examined
  3013	his handsome face. NatÃ¡sha, very still, peered out from her ambush,
  3014	waiting to see what he would do. He stood a little while before the
  3015	glass, smiled, and walked toward the other door. NatÃ¡sha was about to
  3016	call him but changed her mind. âLet him look for me,â thought she.
  3017	Hardly had BorÃ­s gone than SÃ³nya, flushed, in tears, and muttering
  3018	angrily, came in at the other door. NatÃ¡sha checked her first impulse
  3019	to run out to her, and remained in her hiding place, watchingâas
  3020	under an invisible capâto see what went on in the world. She was
  3021	experiencing a new and peculiar pleasure. SÃ³nya, muttering to herself,
  3022	kept looking round toward the drawing room door. It opened and Nicholas
  3023	came in.
  3024	
  3025	âSÃ³nya, what is the matter with you? How can you?â said he, running
  3026	up to her.
  3027	
  3028	âItâs nothing, nothing; leave me alone!â sobbed SÃ³nya.
  3029	
  3030	âAh, I know what it is.â
  3031	
  3032	âWell, if you do, so much the better, and you can go back to her!â
  3033	
  3034	âSÃ³-o-onya! Look here! How can you torture me and yourself like that,
  3035	for a mere fancy?â said Nicholas taking her hand.
  3036	
  3037	SÃ³nya did not pull it away, and left off crying. NatÃ¡sha, not stirring
  3038	and scarcely breathing, watched from her ambush with sparkling eyes.
  3039	âWhat will happen now?â thought she.
  3040	
  3041	âSÃ³nya! What is anyone in the world to me? You alone are
  3042	everything!â said Nicholas. âAnd I will prove it to you.â
  3043	
  3044	âI donât like you to talk like that.â
  3045	
  3046	âWell, then, I wonât; only forgive me, SÃ³nya!â He drew her to him
  3047	and kissed her.
  3048	
  3049	âOh, how nice,â thought NatÃ¡sha; and when SÃ³nya and Nicholas had
  3050	gone out of the conservatory she followed and called BorÃ­s to her.
  3051	
  3052	âBorÃ­s, come here,â said she with a sly and significant look. âI
  3053	have something to tell you. Here, here!â and she led him into the
  3054	conservatory to the place among the tubs where she had been hiding.
  3055	
  3056	BorÃ­s followed her, smiling.
  3057	
  3058	âWhat is the something?â asked he.
  3059	
  3060	She grew confused, glanced round, and, seeing the doll she had thrown
  3061	down on one of the tubs, picked it up.
  3062	
  3063	âKiss the doll,â said she.
  3064	
  3065	BorÃ­s looked attentively and kindly at her eager face, but did not
  3066	reply.
  3067	
  3068	âDonât you want to? Well, then, come here,â said she, and
  3069	went further in among the plants and threw down the doll. âCloser,
  3070	closer!â she whispered.
  3071	
  3072	She caught the young officer by his cuffs, and a look of solemnity and
  3073	fear appeared on her flushed face.
  3074	
  3075	âAnd me? Would you like to kiss me?â she whispered almost inaudibly,
  3076	glancing up at him from under her brows, smiling, and almost crying from
  3077	excitement.
  3078	
  3079	BorÃ­s blushed.
  3080	
  3081	âHow funny you are!â he said, bending down to her and blushing still
  3082	more, but he waited and did nothing.
  3083	
  3084	Suddenly she jumped up onto a tub to be higher than he, embraced him so
  3085	that both her slender bare arms clasped him above his neck, and, tossing
  3086	back her hair, kissed him full on the lips.
  3087	
  3088	Then she slipped down among the flowerpots on the other side of the tubs
  3089	and stood, hanging her head.
  3090	
  3091	âNatÃ¡sha,â he said, âyou know that I love you, but....â
  3092	
  3093	âYou are in love with me?â NatÃ¡sha broke in.
  3094	
  3095	âYes, I am, but please donât let us do like that.... In another four
  3096	years ... then I will ask for your hand.â
  3097	
  3098	NatÃ¡sha considered.
  3099	
  3100	âThirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen,â she counted on her slender
  3101	little fingers. âAll right! Then itâs settled?â
  3102	
  3103	A smile of joy and satisfaction lit up her eager face.
  3104	
  3105	âSettled!â replied BorÃ­s.
  3106	
  3107	âForever?â said the little girl. âTill death itself?â
  3108	
  3109	She took his arm and with a happy face went with him into the adjoining
  3110	sitting room.
  3111	
  3112

  3116	CHAPTER XIV
  3117	
  3118	After receiving her visitors, the countess was so tired that she gave
  3119	orders to admit no more, but the porter was told to be sure to invite to
  3120	dinner all who came âto congratulate.â The countess wished to have
  3121	a tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte talk with the friend of her childhood, Princess Anna
  3122	MikhÃ¡ylovna, whom she had not seen properly since she returned from
  3123	Petersburg. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, with her tear-worn but pleasant face,
  3124	drew her chair nearer to that of the countess.
  3125	
  3126	âWith you I will be quite frank,â said Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna. âThere
  3127	are not many left of us old friends! Thatâs why I so value your
  3128	friendship.â
  3129	
  3130	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna looked at VÃ©ra and paused. The countess pressed her
  3131	friendâs hand.
  3132	
  3133	âVÃ©ra,â she said to her eldest daughter who was evidently not a
  3134	favorite, âhow is it you have so little tact? Donât you see you are
  3135	not wanted here? Go to the other girls, or...â
  3136	
  3137	The handsome VÃ©ra smiled contemptuously but did not seem at all hurt.
  3138	
  3139	âIf you had told me sooner, Mamma, I would have gone,â she replied
  3140	as she rose to go to her own room.
  3141	
  3142	But as she passed the sitting room she noticed two couples sitting,
  3143	one pair at each window. She stopped and smiled scornfully. SÃ³nya was
  3144	sitting close to Nicholas who was copying out some verses for her, the
  3145	first he had ever written. BorÃ­s and NatÃ¡sha were at the other window
  3146	and ceased talking when VÃ©ra entered. SÃ³nya and NatÃ¡sha looked at
  3147	VÃ©ra with guilty, happy faces.
  3148	
  3149	It was pleasant and touching to see these little girls in love; but
  3150	apparently the sight of them roused no pleasant feeling in VÃ©ra.
  3151	
  3152	âHow often have I asked you not to take my things?â she said. âYou
  3153	have a room of your own,â and she took the inkstand from Nicholas.
  3154	
  3155	âIn a minute, in a minute,â he said, dipping his pen.
  3156	
  3157	âYou always manage to do things at the wrong time,â continued VÃ©ra.
  3158	âYou came rushing into the drawing room so that everyone felt ashamed
  3159	of you.â
  3160	
  3161	Though what she said was quite just, perhaps for that very reason no one
  3162	replied, and the four simply looked at one another. She lingered in the
  3163	room with the inkstand in her hand.
  3164	
  3165	âAnd at your age what secrets can there be between NatÃ¡sha and
  3166	BorÃ­s, or between you two? Itâs all nonsense!â
  3167	
  3168	âNow, VÃ©ra, what does it matter to you?â said NatÃ¡sha in defense,
  3169	speaking very gently.
  3170	
  3171	She seemed that day to be more than ever kind and affectionate to
  3172	everyone.
  3173	
  3174	âVery silly,â said VÃ©ra. âI am ashamed of you. Secrets indeed!â
  3175	
  3176	âAll have secrets of their own,â answered NatÃ¡sha, getting warmer.
  3177	âWe donât interfere with you and Berg.â
  3178	
  3179	âI should think not,â said VÃ©ra, âbecause there can never be
  3180	anything wrong in my behavior. But Iâll just tell Mamma how you are
  3181	behaving with BorÃ­s.â
  3182	
  3183	âNatÃ¡lya IlynÃ­chna behaves very well to me,â remarked BorÃ­s. âI
  3184	have nothing to complain of.â
  3185	
  3186	âDonât, BorÃ­s! You are such a diplomat that it is really
  3187	tiresome,â said NatÃ¡sha in a mortified voice that trembled slightly.
  3188	(She used the word âdiplomat,â which was just then much in vogue
  3189	among the children, in the special sense they attached to it.) âWhy
  3190	does she bother me?â And she added, turning to VÃ©ra, âYouâll
  3191	never understand it, because youâve never loved anyone. You have no
  3192	heart! You are a Madame de Genlis and nothing moreâ (this nickname,
  3193	bestowed on VÃ©ra by Nicholas, was considered very stinging), âand
  3194	your greatest pleasure is to be unpleasant to people! Go and flirt with
  3195	Berg as much as you please,â she finished quickly.
  3196	
  3197	âI shall at any rate not run after a young man before visitors...â
  3198	
  3199	âWell, now youâve done what you wanted,â put in Nicholasââsaid
  3200	unpleasant things to everyone and upset them. Letâs go to the
  3201	nursery.â
  3202	
  3203	All four, like a flock of scared birds, got up and left the room.
  3204	
  3205	âThe unpleasant things were said to me,â remarked VÃ©ra, âI said
  3206	none to anyone.â
  3207	
  3208	âMadame de Genlis! Madame de Genlis!â shouted laughing voices
  3209	through the door.
  3210	
  3211	The handsome VÃ©ra, who produced such an irritating and unpleasant
  3212	effect on everyone, smiled and, evidently unmoved by what had been
  3213	said to her, went to the looking glass and arranged her hair and scarf.
  3214	Looking at her own handsome face she seemed to become still colder and
  3215	calmer.
  3216	
  3217	
  3218	In the drawing room the conversation was still going on.
  3219	
  3220	âAh, my dear,â said the countess, âmy life is not all roses
  3221	either. Donât I know that at the rate we are living our means wonât
  3222	last long? Itâs all the Club and his easygoing nature. Even in the
  3223	country do we get any rest? Theatricals, hunting, and heaven knows what
  3224	besides! But donât letâs talk about me; tell me how you managed
  3225	everything. I often wonder at you, Annetteâhow at your age you
  3226	can rush off alone in a carriage to Moscow, to Petersburg, to those
  3227	ministers and great people, and know how to deal with them all! Itâs
  3228	quite astonishing. How did you get things settled? I couldnât possibly
  3229	do it.â
  3230	
  3231	âAh, my love,â answered Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, âGod grant you never
  3232	know what it is to be left a widow without means and with a son you love
  3233	to distraction! One learns many things then,â she added with a certain
  3234	pride. âThat lawsuit taught me much. When I want to see one of those
  3235	big people I write a note: âPrincess So-and-So desires an interview
  3236	with So and-So,â and then I take a cab and go myself two, three, or
  3237	four timesâtill I get what I want. I donât mind what they think of
  3238	me.â
  3239	
  3240	âWell, and to whom did you apply about BÃ³ry?â asked the countess.
  3241	âYou see yours is already an officer in the Guards, while my Nicholas
  3242	is going as a cadet. Thereâs no one to interest himself for him. To
  3243	whom did you apply?â
  3244	
  3245	âTo Prince VasÃ­li. He was so kind. He at once agreed to everything,
  3246	and put the matter before the Emperor,â said Princess Anna
  3247	MikhÃ¡ylovna enthusiastically, quite forgetting all the humiliation she
  3248	had endured to gain her end.
  3249	
  3250	âHas Prince VasÃ­li aged much?â asked the countess. âI have not
  3251	seen him since we acted together at the RumyÃ¡ntsovsâ theatricals. I
  3252	expect he has forgotten me. He paid me attentions in those days,â said
  3253	the countess, with a smile.
  3254	
  3255	âHe is just the same as ever,â replied Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna,
  3256	âoverflowing with amiability. His position has not turned his head
  3257	at all. He said to me, âI am sorry I can do so little for you, dear
  3258	Princess. I am at your command.â Yes, he is a fine fellow and a very
  3259	kind relation. But, Nataly, you know my love for my son: I would do
  3260	anything for his happiness! And my affairs are in such a bad way that my
  3261	position is now a terrible one,â continued Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, sadly,
  3262	dropping her voice. âMy wretched lawsuit takes all I have and makes no
  3263	progress. Would you believe it, I have literally not a penny and donât
  3264	know how to equip BorÃ­s.â She took out her handkerchief and began to
  3265	cry. âI need five hundred rubles, and have only one twenty-five-ruble
  3266	note. I am in such a state.... My only hope now is in Count Cyril
  3267	VladÃ­mirovich BezÃºkhov. If he will not assist his godsonâyou know
  3268	he is BÃ³ryâs godfatherâand allow him something for his maintenance,
  3269	all my trouble will have been thrown away.... I shall not be able to
  3270	equip him.â
  3271	
  3272	The countessâ eyes filled with tears and she pondered in silence.
  3273	
  3274	âI often think, though, perhaps itâs a sin,â said the princess,
  3275	âthat here lives Count Cyril VladÃ­mirovich BezÃºkhov so rich, all
  3276	alone... that tremendous fortune... and what is his life worth? Itâs a
  3277	burden to him, and BÃ³ryâs life is only just beginning....â
  3278	
  3279	âSurely he will leave something to BorÃ­s,â said the countess.
  3280	
  3281	âHeaven only knows, my dear! These rich grandees are so selfish.
  3282	Still, I will take BorÃ­s and go to see him at once, and I shall speak
  3283	to him straight out. Let people think what they will of me, itâs
  3284	really all the same to me when my sonâs fate is at stake.â The
  3285	princess rose. âItâs now two oâclock and you dine at four. There
  3286	will just be time.â
  3287	
  3288	And like a practical Petersburg lady who knows how to make the most of
  3289	time, Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna sent someone to call her son, and went into the
  3290	anteroom with him.
  3291	
  3292	âGood-by, my dear,â said she to the countess who saw her to the
  3293	door, and added in a whisper so that her son should not hear, âWish me
  3294	good luck.â
  3295	
  3296	âAre you going to Count Cyril VladÃ­mirovich, my dear?â said the
  3297	count coming out from the dining hall into the anteroom, and he added:
  3298	âIf he is better, ask Pierre to dine with us. He has been to the
  3299	house, you know, and danced with the children. Be sure to invite him, my
  3300	dear. We will see how TarÃ¡s distinguishes himself today. He says Count
  3301	OrlÃ³v never gave such a dinner as ours will be!â
  3302	
  3303	
  3304	
  3305	
  3306	
  3307	CHAPTER XV
  3308	
  3309	âMy dear BorÃ­s,â said Princess Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna to her son as
  3310	Countess RostÃ³vaâs carriage in which they were seated drove over the
  3311	straw covered street and turned into the wide courtyard of Count Cyril
  3312	VladÃ­mirovich BezÃºkhovâs house. âMy dear BorÃ­s,â said the
  3313	mother, drawing her hand from beneath her old mantle and laying
  3314	it timidly and tenderly on her sonâs arm, âbe affectionate and
  3315	attentive to him. Count Cyril VladÃ­mirovich is your godfather after
  3316	all, and your future depends on him. Remember that, my dear, and be nice
  3317	to him, as you so well know how to be.â
  3318	
  3319	âIf only I knew that anything besides humiliation would come of
  3320	it...â answered her son coldly. âBut I have promised and will do it
  3321	for your sake.â
  3322	
  3323	Although the hall porter saw someoneâs carriage standing at the
  3324	entrance, after scrutinizing the mother and son (who without asking to
  3325	be announced had passed straight through the glass porch between the
  3326	rows of statues in niches) and looking significantly at the ladyâs old
  3327	cloak, he asked whether they wanted the count or the princesses, and,
  3328	hearing that they wished to see the count, said his excellency was worse
  3329	today, and that his excellency was not receiving anyone.
  3330	
  3331	âWe may as well go back,â said the son in French.
  3332	
  3333	âMy dear!â exclaimed his mother imploringly, again laying her hand
  3334	on his arm as if that touch might soothe or rouse him.
  3335	
  3336	BorÃ­s said no more, but looked inquiringly at his mother without taking
  3337	off his cloak.
  3338	
  3339	âMy friend,â said Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna in gentle tones, addressing
  3340	the hall porter, âI know Count Cyril VladÃ­mirovich is very ill...
  3341	thatâs why I have come... I am a relation. I shall not disturb him,
  3342	my friend... I only need see Prince VasÃ­li SergÃ©evich: he is staying
  3343	here, is he not? Please announce me.â
  3344	
  3345	The hall porter sullenly pulled a bell that rang upstairs, and turned
  3346	away.
  3347	
  3348	âPrincess DrubetskÃ¡ya to see Prince VasÃ­li SergÃ©evich,â he called
  3349	to a footman dressed in knee breeches, shoes, and a swallow-tail coat,
  3350	who ran downstairs and looked over from the halfway landing.
  3351	
  3352	The mother smoothed the folds of her dyed silk dress before a large
  3353	Venetian mirror in the wall, and in her trodden-down shoes briskly
  3354	ascended the carpeted stairs.
  3355	
  3356	âMy dear,â she said to her son, once more stimulating him by a
  3357	touch, âyou promised me!â
  3358	
  3359	The son, lowering his eyes, followed her quietly.
  3360	
  3361	They entered the large hall, from which one of the doors led to the
  3362	apartments assigned to Prince VasÃ­li.
  3363	
  3364	Just as the mother and son, having reached the middle of the hall, were
  3365	about to ask their way of an elderly footman who had sprung up as they
  3366	entered, the bronze handle of one of the doors turned and Prince VasÃ­li
  3367	came outâwearing a velvet coat with a single star on his breast,
  3368	as was his custom when at homeâtaking leave of a good-looking,
  3369	dark-haired man. This was the celebrated Petersburg doctor, Lorrain.
  3370	
  3371	âThen it is certain?â said the prince.
  3372	
  3373	âPrince, humanum est errare, * but...â replied the doctor,
  3374	swallowing his râs, and pronouncing the Latin words with a French
  3375	accent.
  3376	
  3377	     * To err is human.
  3378	
  3379	âVery well, very well...â
  3380	
  3381	Seeing Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna and her son, Prince VasÃ­li dismissed the
  3382	doctor with a bow and approached them silently and with a look of
  3383	inquiry. The son noticed that an expression of profound sorrow suddenly
  3384	clouded his motherâs face, and he smiled slightly.
  3385	
  3386	âAh, Prince! In what sad circumstances we meet again! And how is our
  3387	dear invalid?â said she, as though unaware of the cold offensive look
  3388	fixed on her.
  3389	
  3390	Prince VasÃ­li stared at her and at BorÃ­s questioningly and perplexed.
  3391	BorÃ­s bowed politely. Prince VasÃ­li without acknowledging the bow
  3392	turned to Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, answering her query by a movement of the
  3393	head and lips indicating very little hope for the patient.
  3394	
  3395	âIs it possible?â exclaimed Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna. âOh, how awful!
  3396	It is terrible to think.... This is my son,â she added, indicating
  3397	BorÃ­s. âHe wanted to thank you himself.â
  3398	
  3399	BorÃ­s bowed again politely.
  3400	
  3401	âBelieve me, Prince, a motherâs heart will never forget what you
  3402	have done for us.â
  3403	
  3404	âI am glad I was able to do you a service, my dear Anna
  3405	MikhÃ¡ylovna,â said Prince VasÃ­li, arranging his lace frill, and in
  3406	tone and manner, here in Moscow to Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna whom he had placed
  3407	under an obligation, assuming an air of much greater importance than he
  3408	had done in Petersburg at Anna SchÃ©rerâs reception.
  3409	
  3410	âTry to serve well and show yourself worthy,â added he, addressing
  3411	BorÃ­s with severity. âI am glad.... Are you here on leave?â he went
  3412	on in his usual tone of indifference.
  3413	
  3414	âI am awaiting orders to join my new regiment, your excellency,â
  3415	replied BorÃ­s, betraying neither annoyance at the princeâs brusque
  3416	manner nor a desire to enter into conversation, but speaking so quietly
  3417	and respectfully that the prince gave him a searching glance.
  3418	
  3419	âAre you living with your mother?â
  3420	
  3421	âI am living at Countess RostÃ³vaâs,â replied BorÃ­s, again
  3422	adding, âyour excellency.â
  3423	
  3424	âThat is, with IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v who married Nataly ShinshinÃ¡,â said
  3425	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna.
  3426	
  3427	âI know, I know,â answered Prince VasÃ­li in his monotonous voice.
  3428	âI never could understand how Nataly made up her mind to marry that
  3429	unlicked bear! A perfectly absurd and stupid fellow, and a gambler too,
  3430	I am told.â
  3431	
  3432	âBut a very kind man, Prince,â said Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna with a
  3433	pathetic smile, as though she too knew that Count RostÃ³v deserved this
  3434	censure, but asked him not to be too hard on the poor old man. âWhat
  3435	do the doctors say?â asked the princess after a pause, her worn face
  3436	again expressing deep sorrow.
  3437	
  3438	âThey give little hope,â replied the prince.
  3439	
  3440	âAnd I should so like to thank Uncle once for all his kindness to me
  3441	and BorÃ­s. He is his godson,â she added, her tone suggesting that
  3442	this fact ought to give Prince VasÃ­li much satisfaction.
  3443	
  3444	Prince VasÃ­li became thoughtful and frowned. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna saw that
  3445	he was afraid of finding in her a rival for Count BezÃºkhovâs fortune,
  3446	and hastened to reassure him.
  3447	
  3448	âIf it were not for my sincere affection and devotion to Uncle,â
  3449	said she, uttering the word with peculiar assurance and unconcern, âI
  3450	know his character: noble, upright ... but you see he has no one with
  3451	him except the young princesses.... They are still young....â She bent
  3452	her head and continued in a whisper: âHas he performed his final duty,
  3453	Prince? How priceless are those last moments! It can make things no
  3454	worse, and it is absolutely necessary to prepare him if he is so ill.
  3455	We women, Prince,â and she smiled tenderly, âalways know how to say
  3456	these things. I absolutely must see him, however painful it may be for
  3457	me. I am used to suffering.â
  3458	
  3459	Evidently the prince understood her, and also understood, as he had done
  3460	at Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs, that it would be difficult to get rid of Anna
  3461	MikhÃ¡ylovna.
  3462	
  3463	âWould not such a meeting be too trying for him, dear Anna
  3464	MikhÃ¡ylovna?â said he. âLet us wait until evening. The doctors are
  3465	expecting a crisis.â
  3466	
  3467	âBut one cannot delay, Prince, at such a moment! Consider that the
  3468	welfare of his soul is at stake. Ah, it is awful: the duties of a
  3469	Christian...â
  3470	
  3471	A door of one of the inner rooms opened and one of the princesses, the
  3472	countâs niece, entered with a cold, stern face. The length of her
  3473	body was strikingly out of proportion to her short legs. Prince VasÃ­li
  3474	turned to her.
  3475	
  3476	âWell, how is he?â
  3477	
  3478	âStill the same; but what can you expect, this noise...â said the
  3479	princess, looking at Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna as at a stranger.
  3480	
  3481	âAh, my dear, I hardly knew you,â said Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna with a
  3482	happy smile, ambling lightly up to the countâs niece. âI have come,
  3483	and am at your service to help you nurse my uncle. I imagine what you
  3484	have gone through,â and she sympathetically turned up her eyes.
  3485	
  3486	The princess gave no reply and did not even smile, but left the room as
  3487	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna took off her gloves and, occupying the position she
  3488	had conquered, settled down in an armchair, inviting Prince VasÃ­li to
  3489	take a seat beside her.
  3490	
  3491	âBorÃ­s,â she said to her son with a smile, âI shall go in to see
  3492	the count, my uncle; but you, my dear, had better go to Pierre meanwhile
  3493	and donât forget to give him the RostÃ³vsâ invitation. They ask him
  3494	to dinner. I suppose he wonât go?â she continued, turning to the
  3495	prince.
  3496	
  3497	âOn the contrary,â replied the prince, who had plainly become
  3498	depressed, âI shall be only too glad if you relieve me of that young
  3499	man.... Here he is, and the count has not once asked for him.â
  3500	
  3501	He shrugged his shoulders. A footman conducted BorÃ­s down one flight of
  3502	stairs and up another, to Pierreâs rooms.
  3503	
  3504	
  3505

  3508	CHAPTER XVI
  3509	
  3510	Pierre, after all, had not managed to choose a career for himself in
  3511	Petersburg, and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and
  3512	sent to Moscow. The story told about him at Count RostÃ³vâs was true.
  3513	Pierre had taken part in tying a policeman to a bear. He had now been
  3514	for some days in Moscow and was staying as usual at his fatherâs
  3515	house. Though he expected that the story of his escapade would be
  3516	already known in Moscow and that the ladies about his fatherâwho were
  3517	never favorably disposed toward himâwould have used it to turn the
  3518	count against him, he nevertheless on the day of his arrival went to
  3519	his fatherâs part of the house. Entering the drawing room, where the
  3520	princesses spent most of their time, he greeted the ladies, two of whom
  3521	were sitting at embroidery frames while a third read aloud. It was the
  3522	eldest who was readingâthe one who had met Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna. The
  3523	two younger ones were embroidering: both were rosy and pretty and they
  3524	differed only in that one had a little mole on her lip which made her
  3525	much prettier. Pierre was received as if he were a corpse or a leper.
  3526	The eldest princess paused in her reading and silently stared at him
  3527	with frightened eyes; the second assumed precisely the same expression;
  3528	while the youngest, the one with the mole, who was of a cheerful and
  3529	lively disposition, bent over her frame to hide a smile probably evoked
  3530	by the amusing scene she foresaw. She drew her wool down through the
  3531	canvas and, scarcely able to refrain from laughing, stooped as if trying
  3532	to make out the pattern.
  3533	
  3534	âHow do you do, cousin?â said Pierre. âYou donât recognize
  3535	me?â
  3536	
  3537	âI recognize you only too well, too well.â
  3538	
  3539	âHow is the count? Can I see him?â asked Pierre, awkwardly as usual,
  3540	but unabashed.
  3541	
  3542	âThe count is suffering physically and mentally, and apparently you
  3543	have done your best to increase his mental sufferings.â
  3544	
  3545	âCan I see the count?â Pierre again asked.
  3546	
  3547	âHm.... If you wish to kill him, to kill him outright, you can see
  3548	him... Olga, go and see whether Uncleâs beef tea is readyâit is
  3549	almost time,â she added, giving Pierre to understand that they were
  3550	busy, and busy making his father comfortable, while evidently he,
  3551	Pierre, was only busy causing him annoyance.
  3552	
  3553	Olga went out. Pierre stood looking at the sisters; then he bowed and
  3554	said: âThen I will go to my rooms. You will let me know when I can see
  3555	him.â
  3556	
  3557	And he left the room, followed by the low but ringing laughter of the
  3558	sister with the mole.
  3559	
  3560	Next day Prince VasÃ­li had arrived and settled in the countâs house.
  3561	He sent for Pierre and said to him: âMy dear fellow, if you are going
  3562	to behave here as you did in Petersburg, you will end very badly; that
  3563	is all I have to say to you. The count is very, very ill, and you must
  3564	not see him at all.â
  3565	
  3566	Since then Pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the whole time in
  3567	his rooms upstairs.
  3568	
  3569	When BorÃ­s appeared at his door Pierre was pacing up and down his room,
  3570	stopping occasionally at a corner to make menacing gestures at the wall,
  3571	as if running a sword through an invisible foe, and glaring savagely
  3572	over his spectacles, and then again resuming his walk, muttering
  3573	indistinct words, shrugging his shoulders and gesticulating.
  3574	
  3575	âEngland is done for,â said he, scowling and pointing his finger
  3576	at someone unseen. âMr. Pitt, as a traitor to the nation and to the
  3577	rights of man, is sentenced to...â But before Pierreâwho at that
  3578	moment imagined himself to be Napoleon in person and to have just
  3579	effected the dangerous crossing of the Straits of Dover and captured
  3580	Londonâcould pronounce Pittâs sentence, he saw a well-built and
  3581	handsome young officer entering his room. Pierre paused. He had left
  3582	Moscow when BorÃ­s was a boy of fourteen, and had quite forgotten him,
  3583	but in his usual impulsive and hearty way he took BorÃ­s by the hand
  3584	with a friendly smile.
  3585	
  3586	âDo you remember me?â asked BorÃ­s quietly with a pleasant smile.
  3587	âI have come with my mother to see the count, but it seems he is not
  3588	well.â
  3589	
  3590	âYes, it seems he is ill. People are always disturbing him,â
  3591	answered Pierre, trying to remember who this young man was.
  3592	
  3593	BorÃ­s felt that Pierre did not recognize him but did not consider
  3594	it necessary to introduce himself, and without experiencing the least
  3595	embarrassment looked Pierre straight in the face.
  3596	
  3597	âCount RostÃ³v asks you to come to dinner today,â said he, after a
  3598	considerable pause which made Pierre feel uncomfortable.
  3599	
  3600	âAh, Count RostÃ³v!â exclaimed Pierre joyfully. âThen you are his
  3601	son, IlyÃ¡? Only fancy, I didnât know you at first. Do you remember
  3602	how we went to the Sparrow Hills with Madame Jacquot?... Itâs such an
  3603	age...â
  3604	
  3605	âYou are mistaken,â said BorÃ­s deliberately, with a bold and
  3606	slightly sarcastic smile. âI am BorÃ­s, son of Princess Anna
  3607	MikhÃ¡ylovna DrubetskÃ¡ya. RostÃ³v, the father, is IlyÃ¡, and his son is
  3608	Nicholas. I never knew any Madame Jacquot.â
  3609	
  3610	Pierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes or bees.
  3611	
  3612	âOh dear, what am I thinking about? Iâve mixed everything up. One
  3613	has so many relatives in Moscow! So you are BorÃ­s? Of course. Well, now
  3614	we know where we are. And what do you think of the Boulogne expedition?
  3615	The English will come off badly, you know, if Napoleon gets across the
  3616	Channel. I think the expedition is quite feasible. If only Villeneuve
  3617	doesnât make a mess of things!â
  3618	
  3619	BorÃ­s knew nothing about the Boulogne expedition; he did not read the
  3620	papers and it was the first time he had heard Villeneuveâs name.
  3621	
  3622	âWe here in Moscow are more occupied with dinner parties and scandal
  3623	than with politics,â said he in his quiet ironical tone. âI know
  3624	nothing about it and have not thought about it. Moscow is chiefly busy
  3625	with gossip,â he continued. âJust now they are talking about you and
  3626	your father.â
  3627	
  3628	Pierre smiled in his good-natured way as if afraid for his companionâs
  3629	sake that the latter might say something he would afterwards regret.
  3630	But BorÃ­s spoke distinctly, clearly, and dryly, looking straight into
  3631	Pierreâs eyes.
  3632	
  3633	âMoscow has nothing else to do but gossip,â BorÃ­s went on.
  3634	âEverybody is wondering to whom the count will leave his fortune,
  3635	though he may perhaps outlive us all, as I sincerely hope he will...â
  3636	
  3637	âYes, it is all very horrid,â interrupted Pierre, âvery horrid.â
  3638	
  3639	Pierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently say
  3640	something disconcerting to himself.
  3641	
  3642	âAnd it must seem to you,â said BorÃ­s flushing slightly, but not
  3643	changing his tone or attitude, âit must seem to you that everyone is
  3644	trying to get something out of the rich man?â
  3645	
  3646	âSo it does,â thought Pierre.
  3647	
  3648	âBut I just wish to say, to avoid misunderstandings, that you are
  3649	quite mistaken if you reckon me or my mother among such people. We are
  3650	very poor, but for my own part at any rate, for the very reason that
  3651	your father is rich, I donât regard myself as a relation of his, and
  3652	neither I nor my mother would ever ask or take anything from him.â
  3653	
  3654	For a long time Pierre could not understand, but when he did, he jumped
  3655	up from the sofa, seized BorÃ­s under the elbow in his quick, clumsy
  3656	way, and, blushing far more than BorÃ­s, began to speak with a feeling
  3657	of mingled shame and vexation.
  3658	
  3659	âWell, this is strange! Do you suppose I... who could think?... I know
  3660	very well...â
  3661	
  3662	But BorÃ­s again interrupted him.
  3663	
  3664	âI am glad I have spoken out fully. Perhaps you did not like it? You
  3665	must excuse me,â said he, putting Pierre at ease instead of being put
  3666	at ease by him, âbut I hope I have not offended you. I always make it
  3667	a rule to speak out... Well, what answer am I to take? Will you come to
  3668	dinner at the RostÃ³vsâ?â
  3669	
  3670	And BorÃ­s, having apparently relieved himself of an onerous duty and
  3671	extricated himself from an awkward situation and placed another in it,
  3672	became quite pleasant again.
  3673	
  3674	âNo, but I say,â said Pierre, calming down, âyou are a wonderful
  3675	fellow! What you have just said is good, very good. Of course you
  3676	donât know me. We have not met for such a long time... not since we
  3677	were children. You might think that I... I understand, quite understand.
  3678	I could not have done it myself, I should not have had the courage, but
  3679	itâs splendid. I am very glad to have made your acquaintance. Itâs
  3680	queer,â he added after a pause, âthat you should have suspected
  3681	me!â He began to laugh. âWell, what of it! I hope weâll get better
  3682	acquainted,â and he pressed BorÃ­sâ hand. âDo you know, I have not
  3683	once been in to see the count. He has not sent for me.... I am sorry for
  3684	him as a man, but what can one do?â
  3685	
  3686	âAnd so you think Napoleon will manage to get an army across?â asked
  3687	BorÃ­s with a smile.
  3688	
  3689	Pierre saw that BorÃ­s wished to change the subject, and being of the
  3690	same mind he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the
  3691	Boulogne expedition.
  3692	
  3693	A footman came in to summon BorÃ­sâthe princess was going. Pierre, in
  3694	order to make BorÃ­sâ better acquaintance, promised to come to dinner,
  3695	and warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately over his spectacles
  3696	into BorÃ­sâ eyes. After he had gone Pierre continued pacing up and
  3697	down the room for a long time, no longer piercing an imaginary foe with
  3698	his imaginary sword, but smiling at the remembrance of that pleasant,
  3699	intelligent, and resolute young man.
  3700	
  3701	As often happens in early youth, especially to one who leads a lonely
  3702	life, he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young man and made up
  3703	his mind that they would be friends.
  3704	
  3705	Prince VasÃ­li saw the princess off. She held a handkerchief to her eyes
  3706	and her face was tearful.
  3707	
  3708	âIt is dreadful, dreadful!â she was saying, âbut cost me what it
  3709	may I shall do my duty. I will come and spend the night. He must not be
  3710	left like this. Every moment is precious. I canât think why his nieces
  3711	put it off. Perhaps God will help me to find a way to prepare him!...
  3712	Adieu, Prince! May God support you...â
  3713	
  3714	âAdieu, ma bonne,â answered Prince VasÃ­li turning away from her.
  3715	
  3716	âOh, he is in a dreadful state,â said the mother to her son when
  3717	they were in the carriage. âHe hardly recognizes anybody.â
  3718	
  3719	âI donât understand, Mammaâwhat is his attitude to Pierre?â
  3720	asked the son.
  3721	
  3722	âThe will will show that, my dear; our fate also depends on it.â
  3723	
  3724	âBut why do you expect that he will leave us anything?â
  3725	
  3726	âAh, my dear! He is so rich, and we are so poor!â
  3727	
  3728	âWell, that is hardly a sufficient reason, Mamma...â
  3729	
  3730	âOh, Heaven! How ill he is!â exclaimed the mother.
  3731	
  3732	
  3733	
  3734	
  3735	
  3736	CHAPTER XVII
  3737	
  3738	After Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna had driven off with her son to visit Count Cyril
  3739	VladÃ­mirovich BezÃºkhov, Countess RostÃ³va sat for a long time all
  3740	alone applying her handkerchief to her eyes. At last she rang.
  3741	
  3742	âWhat is the matter with you, my dear?â she said crossly to the maid
  3743	who kept her waiting some minutes. âDonât you wish to serve me? Then
  3744	Iâll find you another place.â
  3745	
  3746	The countess was upset by her friendâs sorrow and humiliating poverty,
  3747	and was therefore out of sorts, a state of mind which with her always
  3748	found expression in calling her maid âmy dearâ and speaking to her
  3749	with exaggerated politeness.
  3750	
  3751	âI am very sorry, maâam,â answered the maid.
  3752	
  3753	âAsk the count to come to me.â
  3754	
  3755	The count came waddling in to see his wife with a rather guilty look as
  3756	usual.
  3757	
  3758	âWell, little countess? What a sautÃ© of game au madÃ¨re we are to
  3759	have, my dear! I tasted it. The thousand rubles I paid for TarÃ¡s were
  3760	not ill-spent. He is worth it!â
  3761	
  3762	He sat down by his wife, his elbows on his knees and his hands ruffling
  3763	his gray hair.
  3764	
  3765	âWhat are your commands, little countess?â
  3766	
  3767	âYou see, my dear... Whatâs that mess?â she said, pointing to his
  3768	waistcoat. âItâs the sautÃ©, most likely,â she added with a smile.
  3769	âWell, you see, Count, I want some money.â
  3770	
  3771	Her face became sad.
  3772	
  3773	âOh, little countess!â ... and the count began bustling to get out
  3774	his pocketbook.
  3775	
  3776	âI want a great deal, Count! I want five hundred rubles,â and taking
  3777	out her cambric handkerchief she began wiping her husbandâs waistcoat.
  3778	
  3779	âYes, immediately, immediately! Hey, whoâs there?â he called out
  3780	in a tone only used by persons who are certain that those they call will
  3781	rush to obey the summons. âSend DmÃ­tri to me!â
  3782	
  3783	DmÃ­tri, a man of good family who had been brought up in the countâs
  3784	house and now managed all his affairs, stepped softly into the room.
  3785	
  3786	âThis is what I want, my dear fellow,â said the count to the
  3787	deferential young man who had entered. âBring me...â he reflected
  3788	a moment, âyes, bring me seven hundred rubles, yes! But mind, donât
  3789	bring me such tattered and dirty notes as last time, but nice clean ones
  3790	for the countess.â
  3791	
  3792	âYes, DmÃ­tri, clean ones, please,â said the countess, sighing
  3793	deeply.
  3794	
  3795	âWhen would you like them, your excellency?â asked DmÃ­tri. âAllow
  3796	me to inform you... But, donât be uneasy,â he added, noticing that
  3797	the count was beginning to breathe heavily and quickly which was always
  3798	a sign of approaching anger. âI was forgetting... Do you wish it
  3799	brought at once?â
  3800	
  3801	âYes, yes; just so! Bring it. Give it to the countess.â
  3802	
  3803	âWhat a treasure that DmÃ­tri is,â added the count with a smile when
  3804	the young man had departed. âThere is never any âimpossibleâ with
  3805	him. Thatâs a thing I hate! Everything is possible.â
  3806	
  3807	âAh, money, Count, money! How much sorrow it causes in the world,â
  3808	said the countess. âBut I am in great need of this sum.â
  3809	
  3810	âYou, my little countess, are a notorious spendthrift,â said the
  3811	count, and having kissed his wifeâs hand he went back to his study.
  3812	
  3813	When Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna returned from Count BezÃºkhovâs the money, all
  3814	in clean notes, was lying ready under a handkerchief on the countessâ
  3815	little table, and Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna noticed that something was agitating
  3816	her.
  3817	
  3818	âWell, my dear?â asked the countess.
  3819	
  3820	âOh, what a terrible state he is in! One would not know him, he is so
  3821	ill! I was only there a few moments and hardly said a word...â
  3822	
  3823	âAnnette, for heavenâs sake donât refuse me,â the countess
  3824	began, with a blush that looked very strange on her thin, dignified,
  3825	elderly face, and she took the money from under the handkerchief.
  3826	
  3827	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna instantly guessed her intention and stooped to be
  3828	ready to embrace the countess at the appropriate moment.
  3829	
  3830	âThis is for BorÃ­s from me, for his outfit.â
  3831	
  3832	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna was already embracing her and weeping. The countess
  3833	wept too. They wept because they were friends, and because they were
  3834	kindhearted, and because theyâfriends from childhoodâhad to think
  3835	about such a base thing as money, and because their youth was over....
  3836	But those tears were pleasant to them both.
  3837	
  3838	
  3839	
  3840	
  3841	
  3842	CHAPTER XVIII
  3843	
  3844	Countess RostÃ³va, with her daughters and a large number of guests, was
  3845	already seated in the drawing room. The count took the gentlemen into
  3846	his study and showed them his choice collection of Turkish pipes. From
  3847	time to time he went out to ask: âHasnât she come yet?â They
  3848	were expecting MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna AkhrosÃ­mova, known in society as le
  3849	terrible dragon, a lady distinguished not for wealth or rank, but for
  3850	common sense and frank plainness of speech. MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna was known
  3851	to the Imperial family as well as to all Moscow and Petersburg, and both
  3852	cities wondered at her, laughed privately at her rudenesses, and told
  3853	good stories about her, while none the less all without exception
  3854	respected and feared her.
  3855	
  3856	In the countâs room, which was full of tobacco smoke, they talked
  3857	of the war that had been announced in a manifesto, and about the
  3858	recruiting. None of them had yet seen the manifesto, but they all knew
  3859	it had appeared. The count sat on the sofa between two guests who were
  3860	smoking and talking. He neither smoked nor talked, but bending his head
  3861	first to one side and then to the other watched the smokers with evident
  3862	pleasure and listened to the conversation of his two neighbors, whom he
  3863	egged on against each other.
  3864	
  3865	One of them was a sallow, clean-shaven civilian with a thin and wrinkled
  3866	face, already growing old, though he was dressed like a most fashionable
  3867	young man. He sat with his legs up on the sofa as if quite at home and,
  3868	having stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his mouth, was inhaling the
  3869	smoke spasmodically and screwing up his eyes. This was an old bachelor,
  3870	ShinshÃ­n, a cousin of the countessâ, a man with âa sharp tongueâ
  3871	as they said in Moscow society. He seemed to be condescending to
  3872	his companion. The latter, a fresh, rosy officer of the Guards,
  3873	irreproachably washed, brushed, and buttoned, held his pipe in the
  3874	middle of his mouth and with red lips gently inhaled the smoke, letting
  3875	it escape from his handsome mouth in rings. This was Lieutenant Berg, an
  3876	officer in the SemÃ«nov regiment with whom BorÃ­s was to travel to join
  3877	the army, and about whom NatÃ¡sha had teased her elder sister VÃ©ra,
  3878	speaking of Berg as her âintended.â The count sat between them and
  3879	listened attentively. His favorite occupation when not playing boston, a
  3880	card game he was very fond of, was that of listener, especially when he
  3881	succeeded in setting two loquacious talkers at one another.
  3882	
  3883	âWell, then, old chap, mon trÃ¨s honorable Alphonse KÃ¡rlovich,â
  3884	said ShinshÃ­n, laughing ironically and mixing the most ordinary Russian
  3885	expressions with the choicest French phrasesâwhich was a peculiarity
  3886	of his speech. âVous comptez vous faire des rentes sur lâÃ©tat; *
  3887	you want to make something out of your company?â
  3888	
  3889	     * You expect to make an income out of the government.
  3890	
  3891	âNo, Peter NikolÃ¡evich; I only want to show that in the cavalry
  3892	the advantages are far less than in the infantry. Just consider my own
  3893	position now, Peter NikolÃ¡evich...â
  3894	
  3895	Berg always spoke quietly, politely, and with great precision. His
  3896	conversation always related entirely to himself; he would remain calm
  3897	and silent when the talk related to any topic that had no direct bearing
  3898	on himself. He could remain silent for hours without being at all put
  3899	out of countenance himself or making others uncomfortable, but as
  3900	soon as the conversation concerned himself he would begin to talk
  3901	circumstantially and with evident satisfaction.
  3902	
  3903	âConsider my position, Peter NikolÃ¡evich. Were I in the cavalry I
  3904	should get not more than two hundred rubles every four months, even
  3905	with the rank of lieutenant; but as it is I receive two hundred and
  3906	thirty,â said he, looking at ShinshÃ­n and the count with a joyful,
  3907	pleasant smile, as if it were obvious to him that his success must
  3908	always be the chief desire of everyone else.
  3909	
  3910	âBesides that, Peter NikolÃ¡evich, by exchanging into the Guards
  3911	I shall be in a more prominent position,â continued Berg, âand
  3912	vacancies occur much more frequently in the Foot Guards. Then just think
  3913	what can be done with two hundred and thirty rubles! I even manage to
  3914	put a little aside and to send something to my father,â he went on,
  3915	emitting a smoke ring.
  3916	
  3917	âLa balance y est... * A German knows how to skin a flint, as the
  3918	proverb says,â remarked ShinshÃ­n, moving his pipe to the other side
  3919	of his mouth and winking at the count.
  3920	
  3921	      * So that squares matters.
  3922	
  3923	The count burst out laughing. The other guests seeing that ShinshÃ­n
  3924	was talking came up to listen. Berg, oblivious of irony or indifference,
  3925	continued to explain how by exchanging into the Guards he had already
  3926	gained a step on his old comrades of the Cadet Corps; how in wartime
  3927	the company commander might get killed and he, as senior in the company,
  3928	might easily succeed to the post; how popular he was with everyone in
  3929	the regiment, and how satisfied his father was with him. Berg evidently
  3930	enjoyed narrating all this, and did not seem to suspect that others,
  3931	too, might have their own interests. But all he said was so prettily
  3932	sedate, and the naÃ¯vetÃ© of his youthful egotism was so obvious, that
  3933	he disarmed his hearers.
  3934	
  3935	âWell, my boy, youâll get along wherever you goâfoot or
  3936	horseâthat Iâll warrant,â said ShinshÃ­n, patting him on the
  3937	shoulder and taking his feet off the sofa.
  3938	
  3939	Berg smiled joyously. The count, followed by his guests, went into the
  3940	drawing room.
  3941	
  3942	It was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled guests,
  3943	expecting the summons to zakÃºska, * avoid engaging in any long
  3944	conversation but think it necessary to move about and talk, in order
  3945	to show that they are not at all impatient for their food. The host and
  3946	hostess look toward the door, and now and then glance at one another,
  3947	and the visitors try to guess from these glances who, or what, they are
  3948	waiting forâsome important relation who has not yet arrived, or a dish
  3949	that is not yet ready.
  3950	
  3951	     * Hors dâoeuvres.
  3952	
  3953	Pierre had come just at dinnertime and was sitting awkwardly in the
  3954	middle of the drawing room on the first chair he had come across,
  3955	blocking the way for everyone. The countess tried to make him talk,
  3956	but he went on naÃ¯vely looking around through his spectacles as if in
  3957	search of somebody and answered all her questions in monosyllables. He
  3958	was in the way and was the only one who did not notice the fact. Most of
  3959	the guests, knowing of the affair with the bear, looked with curiosity
  3960	at this big, stout, quiet man, wondering how such a clumsy, modest
  3961	fellow could have played such a prank on a policeman.
  3962	
  3963	âYou have only lately arrived?â the countess asked him.
  3964	
  3965	âOui, madame,â replied he, looking around him.
  3966	
  3967	âYou have not yet seen my husband?â
  3968	
  3969	âNon, madame.â He smiled quite inappropriately.
  3970	
  3971	âYou have been in Paris recently, I believe? I suppose itâs very
  3972	interesting.â
  3973	
  3974	âVery interesting.â
  3975	
  3976	The countess exchanged glances with Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna. The latter
  3977	understood that she was being asked to entertain this young man, and
  3978	sitting down beside him she began to speak about his father; but he
  3979	answered her, as he had the countess, only in monosyllables. The other
  3980	guests were all conversing with one another. âThe RazumÃ³vskis... It
  3981	was charming... You are very kind... Countess AprÃ¡ksina...â was heard
  3982	on all sides. The countess rose and went into the ballroom.
  3983	
  3984	âMÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna?â came her voice from there.
  3985	
  3986	âHerself,â came the answer in a rough voice, and MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna
  3987	entered the room.
  3988	
  3989	All the unmarried ladies and even the married ones except the very
  3990	oldest rose. MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna paused at the door. Tall and stout,
  3991	holding high her fifty-year-old head with its gray curls, she stood
  3992	surveying the guests, and leisurely arranged her wide sleeves as if
  3993	rolling them up. MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna always spoke in Russian.
  3994	
  3995	âHealth and happiness to her whose name day we are keeping and to her
  3996	children,â she said, in her loud, full-toned voice which drowned all
  3997	others. âWell, you old sinner,â she went on, turning to the count
  3998	who was kissing her hand, âyouâre feeling dull in Moscow, I daresay?
  3999	Nowhere to hunt with your dogs? But what is to be done, old man? Just
  4000	see how these nestlings are growing up,â and she pointed to the girls.
  4001	âYou must look for husbands for them whether you like it or not....â
  4002	
  4003	âWell,â said she, âhowâs my Cossack?â (MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna
  4004	always called NatÃ¡sha a Cossack) and she stroked the childâs arm as
  4005	she came up fearless and gay to kiss her hand. âI know sheâs a scamp
  4006	of a girl, but I like her.â
  4007	
  4008	She took a pair of pear-shaped ruby earrings from her huge reticule and,
  4009	having given them to the rosy NatÃ¡sha, who beamed with the pleasure
  4010	of her saintâs-day fete, turned away at once and addressed herself to
  4011	Pierre.
  4012	
  4013	âEh, eh, friend! Come here a bit,â said she, assuming a soft high
  4014	tone of voice. âCome here, my friend...â and she ominously tucked
  4015	up her sleeves still higher. Pierre approached, looking at her in a
  4016	childlike way through his spectacles.
  4017	
  4018	âCome nearer, come nearer, friend! I used to be the only one to tell
  4019	your father the truth when he was in favor, and in your case itâs my
  4020	evident duty.â She paused. All were silent, expectant of what was to
  4021	follow, for this was clearly only a prelude.
  4022	
  4023	âA fine lad! My word! A fine lad!... His father lies on his deathbed
  4024	and he amuses himself setting a policeman astride a bear! For shame,
  4025	sir, for shame! It would be better if you went to the war.â
  4026	
  4027	She turned away and gave her hand to the count, who could hardly keep
  4028	from laughing.
  4029	
  4030	âWell, I suppose it is time we were at table?â said MÃ¡rya
  4031	DmÃ­trievna.
  4032	
  4033	The count went in first with MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna, the countess followed
  4034	on the arm of a colonel of hussars, a man of importance to them because
  4035	Nicholas was to go with him to the regiment; then came Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna
  4036	with ShinshÃ­n. Berg gave his arm to VÃ©ra. The smiling Julie KarÃ¡gina
  4037	went in with Nicholas. After them other couples followed, filling the
  4038	whole dining hall, and last of all the children, tutors, and governesses
  4039	followed singly. The footmen began moving about, chairs scraped, the
  4040	band struck up in the gallery, and the guests settled down in their
  4041	places. Then the strains of the countâs household band were replaced
  4042	by the clatter of knives and forks, the voices of visitors, and the
  4043	soft steps of the footmen. At one end of the table sat the countess with
  4044	MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna on her right and Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna on her left, the
  4045	other lady visitors were farther down. At the other end sat the count,
  4046	with the hussar colonel on his left and ShinshÃ­n and the other male
  4047	visitors on his right. Midway down the long table on one side sat the
  4048	grown-up young people: VÃ©ra beside Berg, and Pierre beside BorÃ­s; and
  4049	on the other side, the children, tutors, and governesses. From behind
  4050	the crystal decanters and fruit vases, the count kept glancing at his
  4051	wife and her tall cap with its light-blue ribbons, and busily filled
  4052	his neighborsâ glasses, not neglecting his own. The countess in turn,
  4053	without omitting her duties as hostess, threw significant glances from
  4054	behind the pineapples at her husband whose face and bald head seemed
  4055	by their redness to contrast more than usual with his gray hair. At the
  4056	ladiesâ end an even chatter of voices was heard all the time, at the
  4057	menâs end the voices sounded louder and louder, especially that of the
  4058	colonel of hussars who, growing more and more flushed, ate and drank so
  4059	much that the count held him up as a pattern to the other guests. Berg
  4060	with tender smiles was saying to VÃ©ra that love is not an earthly but
  4061	a heavenly feeling. BorÃ­s was telling his new friend Pierre who the
  4062	guests were and exchanging glances with NatÃ¡sha, who was sitting
  4063	opposite. Pierre spoke little but examined the new faces, and ate a
  4064	great deal. Of the two soups he chose turtle with savory patties and
  4065	went on to the game without omitting a single dish or one of the wines.
  4066	These latter the butler thrust mysteriously forward, wrapped in a
  4067	napkin, from behind the next manâs shoulders and whispered: âDry
  4068	Madeiraâ... âHungarianâ... or âRhine wineâ as the case might
  4069	be. Of the four crystal glasses engraved with the countâs monogram
  4070	that stood before his plate, Pierre held out one at random and drank
  4071	with enjoyment, gazing with ever-increasing amiability at the other
  4072	guests. NatÃ¡sha, who sat opposite, was looking at BorÃ­s as girls of
  4073	thirteen look at the boy they are in love with and have just kissed for
  4074	the first time. Sometimes that same look fell on Pierre, and that funny
  4075	lively little girlâs look made him inclined to laugh without knowing
  4076	why.
  4077	
  4078	Nicholas sat at some distance from SÃ³nya, beside Julie KarÃ¡gina, to
  4079	whom he was again talking with the same involuntary smile. SÃ³nya wore
  4080	a company smile but was evidently tormented by jealousy; now she turned
  4081	pale, now blushed and strained every nerve to overhear what Nicholas
  4082	and Julie were saying to one another. The governess kept looking round
  4083	uneasily as if preparing to resent any slight that might be put upon the
  4084	children. The German tutor was trying to remember all the dishes, wines,
  4085	and kinds of dessert, in order to send a full description of the dinner
  4086	to his people in Germany; and he felt greatly offended when the butler
  4087	with a bottle wrapped in a napkin passed him by. He frowned, trying to
  4088	appear as if he did not want any of that wine, but was mortified because
  4089	no one would understand that it was not to quench his thirst or from
  4090	greediness that he wanted it, but simply from a conscientious desire for
  4091	knowledge.
  4092	
  4093	
  4094	
  4095	
  4096	
  4097	CHAPTER XIX
  4098	
  4099	At the menâs end of the table the talk grew more and more animated.
  4100	The colonel told them that the declaration of war had already appeared
  4101	in Petersburg and that a copy, which he had himself seen, had that day
  4102	been forwarded by courier to the commander in chief.
  4103	
  4104	âAnd why the deuce are we going to fight Bonaparte?â remarked
  4105	ShinshÃ­n. âHe has stopped Austriaâs cackle and I fear it will be
  4106	our turn next.â
  4107	
  4108	The colonel was a stout, tall, plethoric German, evidently devoted to
  4109	the service and patriotically Russian. He resented ShinshÃ­nâs remark.
  4110	
  4111	âIt is for the reasson, my goot sir,â said he, speaking with a
  4112	German accent, âfor the reasson zat ze Emperor knows zat. He
  4113	declares in ze manifessto zat he cannot fiew wiz indifference ze danger
  4114	vreatening Russia and zat ze safety and dignity of ze Empire as vell
  4115	as ze sanctity of its alliances...â he spoke this last word with
  4116	particular emphasis as if in it lay the gist of the matter.
  4117	
  4118	Then with the unerring official memory that characterized him he
  4119	repeated from the opening words of the manifesto:
  4120	
  4121	... and the wish, which constitutes the Emperorâs sole and absolute
  4122	aimâto establish peace in Europe on firm foundationsâhas now decided
  4123	him to despatch part of the army abroad and to create a new condition
  4124	for the attainment of that purpose.
  4125	
  4126	âZat, my dear sir, is vy...â he concluded, drinking a tumbler of
  4127	wine with dignity and looking to the count for approval.
  4128	
  4129	âConnaissez-vous le Proverbe:* âJerome, Jerome, do not roam, but
  4130	turn spindles at home!â?â said ShinshÃ­n, puckering his brows and
  4131	smiling. âCela nous convient Ã  merveille.*(2) SuvÃ³rov nowâhe knew
  4132	what he was about; yet they beat him Ã  plate couture,*(3) and where
  4133	are we to find SuvÃ³rovs now? Je vous demande un peu,â *(4) said he,
  4134	continually changing from French to Russian.
  4135	
  4136	     *Do you know the proverb?
  4137	
  4138	     *(2) That suits us down to the ground.
  4139	
  4140	     *(3) Hollow.
  4141	
  4142	     *(4) I just ask you that.
  4143	
  4144	âVe must vight to the last tr-r-op of our plood!â said the colonel,
  4145	thumping the table; âand ve must tie for our Emperor, and zen all vill
  4146	pe vell. And ve must discuss it as little as po-o-ossibleâ... he dwelt
  4147	particularly on the word possible... âas po-o-ossible,â he ended,
  4148	again turning to the count. âZat is how ve old hussars look at it, and
  4149	zereâs an end of it! And how do you, a young man and a young hussar,
  4150	how do you judge of it?â he added, addressing Nicholas, who when he
  4151	heard that the war was being discussed had turned from his partner with
  4152	eyes and ears intent on the colonel.
  4153	
  4154	âI am quite of your opinion,â replied Nicholas, flaming up, turning
  4155	his plate round and moving his wineglasses about with as much decision
  4156	and desperation as though he were at that moment facing some great
  4157	danger. âI am convinced that we Russians must die or conquer,â he
  4158	concluded, consciousâas were othersâafter the words were uttered
  4159	that his remarks were too enthusiastic and emphatic for the occasion and
  4160	were therefore awkward.
  4161	
  4162	âWhat you said just now was splendid!â said his partner Julie.
  4163	
  4164	SÃ³nya trembled all over and blushed to her ears and behind them and
  4165	down to her neck and shoulders while Nicholas was speaking.
  4166	
  4167	Pierre listened to the colonelâs speech and nodded approvingly.
  4168	
  4169	âThatâs fine,â said he.
  4170	
  4171	âThe young manâs a real hussar!â shouted the colonel, again
  4172	thumping the table.
  4173	
  4174	âWhat are you making such a noise about over there?â MÃ¡rya
  4175	DmÃ­trievnaâs deep voice suddenly inquired from the other end of the
  4176	table. âWhat are you thumping the table for?â she demanded of the
  4177	hussar, âand why are you exciting yourself? Do you think the French
  4178	are here?â
  4179	
  4180	âI am speaking ze truce,â replied the hussar with a smile.
  4181	
  4182	âItâs all about the war,â the count shouted down the table. âYou
  4183	know my sonâs going, MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna? My son is going.â
  4184	
  4185	âI have four sons in the army but still I donât fret. It is all
  4186	in Godâs hands. You may die in your bed or God may spare you in a
  4187	battle,â replied MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievnaâs deep voice, which easily
  4188	carried the whole length of the table.
  4189	
  4190	âThatâs true!â
  4191	
  4192	Once more the conversations concentrated, the ladiesâ at the one end
  4193	and the menâs at the other.
  4194	
  4195	âYou wonât ask,â NatÃ¡shaâs little brother was saying; âI know
  4196	you wonât ask!â
  4197	
  4198	âI will,â replied NatÃ¡sha.
  4199	
  4200	Her face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution. She half
  4201	rose, by a glance inviting Pierre, who sat opposite, to listen to what
  4202	was coming, and turning to her mother:
  4203	
  4204	âMamma!â rang out the clear contralto notes of her childish voice,
  4205	audible the whole length of the table.
  4206	
  4207	âWhat is it?â asked the countess, startled; but seeing by her
  4208	daughterâs face that it was only mischief, she shook a finger at her
  4209	sternly with a threatening and forbidding movement of her head.
  4210	
  4211	The conversation was hushed.
  4212	
  4213	âMamma! What sweets are we going to have?â and NatÃ¡shaâs voice
  4214	sounded still more firm and resolute.
  4215	
  4216	The countess tried to frown, but could not. MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna shook her
  4217	fat finger.
  4218	
  4219	âCossack!â she said threateningly.
  4220	
  4221	Most of the guests, uncertain how to regard this sally, looked at the
  4222	elders.
  4223	
  4224	âYou had better take care!â said the countess.
  4225	
  4226	âMamma! What sweets are we going to have?â NatÃ¡sha again cried
  4227	boldly, with saucy gaiety, confident that her prank would be taken in
  4228	good part.
  4229	
  4230	SÃ³nya and fat little PÃ©tya doubled up with laughter.
  4231	
  4232	âYou see! I have asked,â whispered NatÃ¡sha to her little brother
  4233	and to Pierre, glancing at him again.
  4234	
  4235	âIce pudding, but you wonât get any,â said MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna.
  4236	
  4237	NatÃ¡sha saw there was nothing to be afraid of and so she braved even
  4238	MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna.
  4239	
  4240	âMÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna! What kind of ice pudding? I donât like ice
  4241	cream.â
  4242	
  4243	âCarrot ices.â
  4244	
  4245	âNo! What kind, MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna? What kind?â she almost screamed;
  4246	âI want to know!â
  4247	
  4248	MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna and the countess burst out laughing, and all the
  4249	guests joined in. Everyone laughed, not at MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievnaâs answer
  4250	but at the incredible boldness and smartness of this little girl who had
  4251	dared to treat MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna in this fashion.
  4252	
  4253	NatÃ¡sha only desisted when she had been told that there would be
  4254	pineapple ice. Before the ices, champagne was served round. The band
  4255	again struck up, the count and countess kissed, and the guests, leaving
  4256	their seats, went up to âcongratulateâ the countess, and reached
  4257	across the table to clink glasses with the count, with the children, and
  4258	with one another. Again the footmen rushed about, chairs scraped, and
  4259	in the same order in which they had entered but with redder faces, the
  4260	guests returned to the drawing room and to the countâs study.
  4261	
  4262	
  4263	
  4264	
  4265	
  4266	CHAPTER XX
  4267	
  4268	The card tables were drawn out, sets made up for boston, and the
  4269	countâs visitors settled themselves, some in the two drawing rooms,
  4270	some in the sitting room, some in the library.
  4271	
  4272	The count, holding his cards fanwise, kept himself with difficulty from
  4273	dropping into his usual after-dinner nap, and laughed at everything.
  4274	The young people, at the countessâ instigation, gathered round the
  4275	clavichord and harp. Julie by general request played first. After she
  4276	had played a little air with variations on the harp, she joined the
  4277	other young ladies in begging NatÃ¡sha and Nicholas, who were noted for
  4278	their musical talent, to sing something. NatÃ¡sha, who was treated as
  4279	though she were grown up, was evidently very proud of this but at the
  4280	same time felt shy.
  4281	
  4282	âWhat shall we sing?â she said.
  4283	
  4284	ââThe Brook,ââ suggested Nicholas.
  4285	
  4286	âWell, then, letâs be quick. BorÃ­s, come here,â said NatÃ¡sha.
  4287	âBut where is SÃ³nya?â
  4288	
  4289	She looked round and seeing that her friend was not in the room ran to
  4290	look for her.
  4291	
  4292	Running into SÃ³nyaâs room and not finding her there, NatÃ¡sha ran to
  4293	the nursery, but SÃ³nya was not there either. NatÃ¡sha concluded that
  4294	she must be on the chest in the passage. The chest in the passage was
  4295	the place of mourning for the younger female generation in the RostÃ³v
  4296	household. And there in fact was SÃ³nya lying face downward on Nurseâs
  4297	dirty feather bed on the top of the chest, crumpling her gauzy pink
  4298	dress under her, hiding her face with her slender fingers, and sobbing
  4299	so convulsively that her bare little shoulders shook. NatÃ¡shaâs
  4300	face, which had been so radiantly happy all that saintâs day, suddenly
  4301	changed: her eyes became fixed, and then a shiver passed down her broad
  4302	neck and the corners of her mouth drooped.
  4303	
  4304	âSÃ³nya! What is it? What is the matter?... Oo... Oo... Oo...!â And
  4305	NatÃ¡shaâs large mouth widened, making her look quite ugly, and she
  4306	began to wail like a baby without knowing why, except that SÃ³nya was
  4307	crying. SÃ³nya tried to lift her head to answer but could not, and
  4308	hid her face still deeper in the bed. NatÃ¡sha wept, sitting on the
  4309	blue-striped feather bed and hugging her friend. With an effort SÃ³nya
  4310	sat up and began wiping her eyes and explaining.
  4311	
  4312	âNicholas is going away in a weekâs time, his... papers... have
  4313	come... he told me himself... but still I should not cry,â and she
  4314	showed a paper she held in her handâwith the verses Nicholas had
  4315	written, âstill, I should not cry, but you canât... no one can
  4316	understand... what a soul he has!â
  4317	
  4318	And she began to cry again because he had such a noble soul.
  4319	
  4320	âItâs all very well for you... I am not envious... I love you and
  4321	BorÃ­s also,â she went on, gaining a little strength; âhe is nice...
  4322	there are no difficulties in your way.... But Nicholas is my cousin...
  4323	one would have to... the Metropolitan himself... and even then it
  4324	canât be done. And besides, if she tells Mammaâ (SÃ³nya looked upon
  4325	the countess as her mother and called her so) âthat I am spoiling
  4326	Nicholasâ career and am heartless and ungrateful, while truly... God
  4327	is my witness,â and she made the sign of the cross, âI love her so
  4328	much, and all of you, only VÃ©ra... And what for? What have I done
  4329	to her? I am so grateful to you that I would willingly sacrifice
  4330	everything, only I have nothing....â
  4331	
  4332	SÃ³nya could not continue, and again hid her face in her hands and in
  4333	the feather bed. NatÃ¡sha began consoling her, but her face showed that
  4334	she understood all the gravity of her friendâs trouble.
  4335	
  4336	âSÃ³nya,â she suddenly exclaimed, as if she had guessed the true
  4337	reason of her friendâs sorrow, âIâm sure VÃ©ra has said something
  4338	to you since dinner? Hasnât she?â
  4339	
  4340	âYes, these verses Nicholas wrote himself and I copied some others,
  4341	and she found them on my table and said sheâd show them to Mamma, and
  4342	that I was ungrateful, and that Mamma would never allow him to marry
  4343	me, but that heâll marry Julie. You see how heâs been with her all
  4344	day... NatÃ¡sha, what have I done to deserve it?...â
  4345	
  4346	And again she began to sob, more bitterly than before. NatÃ¡sha lifted
  4347	her up, hugged her, and, smiling through her tears, began comforting
  4348	her.
  4349	
  4350	âSÃ³nya, donât believe her, darling! Donât believe her! Do you
  4351	remember how we and Nicholas, all three of us, talked in the sitting
  4352	room after supper? Why, we settled how everything was to be. I donât
  4353	quite remember how, but donât you remember that it could all be
  4354	arranged and how nice it all was? Thereâs Uncle ShinshÃ­nâs brother
  4355	has married his first cousin. And we are only second cousins, you know.
  4356	And BorÃ­s says it is quite possible. You know I have told him all about
  4357	it. And he is so clever and so good!â said NatÃ¡sha. âDonât
  4358	you cry, SÃ³nya, dear love, darling SÃ³nya!â and she kissed her and
  4359	laughed. âVÃ©raâs spiteful; never mind her! And all will come right
  4360	and she wonât say anything to Mamma. Nicholas will tell her himself,
  4361	and he doesnât care at all for Julie.â
  4362	
  4363	NatÃ¡sha kissed her on the hair.
  4364	
  4365	SÃ³nya sat up. The little kitten brightened, its eyes shone, and it
  4366	seemed ready to lift its tail, jump down on its soft paws, and begin
  4367	playing with the ball of worsted as a kitten should.
  4368	
  4369	âDo you think so?... Really? Truly?â she said, quickly smoothing her
  4370	frock and hair.
  4371	
  4372	âReally, truly!â answered NatÃ¡sha, pushing in a crisp lock that had
  4373	strayed from under her friendâs plaits.
  4374	
  4375	Both laughed.
  4376	
  4377	âWell, letâs go and sing âThe Brook.ââ
  4378	
  4379	âCome along!â
  4380	
  4381	âDo you know, that fat Pierre who sat opposite me is so funny!â said
  4382	NatÃ¡sha, stopping suddenly. âI feel so happy!â
  4383	
  4384	And she set off at a run along the passage.
  4385	
  4386	SÃ³nya, shaking off some down which clung to her and tucking away the
  4387	verses in the bosom of her dress close to her bony little chest, ran
  4388	after NatÃ¡sha down the passage into the sitting room with flushed face
  4389	and light, joyous steps. At the visitorsâ request the young people
  4390	sang the quartette, âThe Brook,â with which everyone was delighted.
  4391	Then Nicholas sang a song he had just learned:
  4392	
  4393	   At nighttime in the moonâs fair glow
  4394	     How sweet, as fancies wander free,
  4395	   To feel that in this world thereâs one
  4396	     Who still is thinking but of thee!
  4397	
  4398	   That while her fingers touch the harp
  4399	     Wafting sweet music oâer the lea,
  4400	   It is for thee thus swells her heart,
  4401	     Sighing its message out to thee...
  4402	
  4403	   A day or two, then bliss unspoilt,
  4404	     But oh! till then I cannot live!...
  4405	
  4406	He had not finished the last verse before the young people began to
  4407	get ready to dance in the large hall, and the sound of the feet and the
  4408	coughing of the musicians were heard from the gallery.
  4409	
  4410	
  4411	Pierre was sitting in the drawing room where ShinshÃ­n had engaged him,
  4412	as a man recently returned from abroad, in a political conversation in
  4413	which several others joined but which bored Pierre. When the music began
  4414	NatÃ¡sha came in and walking straight up to Pierre said, laughing and
  4415	blushing:
  4416	
  4417	âMamma told me to ask you to join the dancers.â
  4418	
  4419	âI am afraid of mixing the figures,â Pierre replied; âbut if you
  4420	will be my teacher...â And lowering his big arm he offered it to the
  4421	slender little girl.
  4422	
  4423	While the couples were arranging themselves and the musicians tuning up,
  4424	Pierre sat down with his little partner. NatÃ¡sha was perfectly happy;
  4425	she was dancing with a grown-up man, who had been abroad. She was
  4426	sitting in a conspicuous place and talking to him like a grown-up lady.
  4427	She had a fan in her hand that one of the ladies had given her to hold.
  4428	Assuming quite the pose of a society woman (heaven knows when and where
  4429	she had learned it) she talked with her partner, fanning herself and
  4430	smiling over the fan.
  4431	
  4432	âDear, dear! Just look at her!â exclaimed the countess as she
  4433	crossed the ballroom, pointing to NatÃ¡sha.
  4434	
  4435	NatÃ¡sha blushed and laughed.
  4436	
  4437	âWell, really, Mamma! Why should you? What is there to be surprised
  4438	at?â
  4439	
  4440	
  4441	In the midst of the third Ã©cossaise there was a clatter of chairs being
  4442	pushed back in the sitting room where the count and MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna
  4443	had been playing cards with the majority of the more distinguished and
  4444	older visitors. They now, stretching themselves after sitting so long,
  4445	and replacing their purses and pocketbooks, entered the ballroom. First
  4446	came MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna and the count, both with merry countenances. The
  4447	count, with playful ceremony somewhat in ballet style, offered his
  4448	bent arm to MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna. He drew himself up, a smile of debonair
  4449	gallantry lit up his face and as soon as the last figure of the
  4450	Ã©cossaise was ended, he clapped his hands to the musicians and shouted
  4451	up to their gallery, addressing the first violin:
  4452	
  4453	âSemÃ«n! Do you know the Daniel Cooper?â
  4454	
  4455	This was the countâs favorite dance, which he had danced in his youth.
  4456	(Strictly speaking, Daniel Cooper was one figure of the anglaise.)
  4457	
  4458	âLook at Papa!â shouted NatÃ¡sha to the whole company, and quite
  4459	forgetting that she was dancing with a grown-up partner she bent her
  4460	curly head to her knees and made the whole room ring with her laughter.
  4461	
  4462	And indeed everybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure at the
  4463	jovial old gentleman, who standing beside his tall and stout partner,
  4464	MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna, curved his arms, beat time, straightened his
  4465	shoulders, turned out his toes, tapped gently with his foot, and, by
  4466	a smile that broadened his round face more and more, prepared the
  4467	onlookers for what was to follow. As soon as the provocatively gay
  4468	strains of Daniel Cooper (somewhat resembling those of a merry peasant
  4469	dance) began to sound, all the doorways of the ballroom were suddenly
  4470	filled by the domestic serfsâthe men on one side and the women on
  4471	the otherâwho with beaming faces had come to see their master making
  4472	merry.
  4473	
  4474	âJust look at the master! A regular eagle he is!â loudly remarked
  4475	the nurse, as she stood in one of the doorways.
  4476	
  4477	The count danced well and knew it. But his partner could not and did not
  4478	want to dance well. Her enormous figure stood erect, her powerful arms
  4479	hanging down (she had handed her reticule to the countess), and only her
  4480	stern but handsome face really joined in the dance. What was expressed
  4481	by the whole of the countâs plump figure, in MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna found
  4482	expression only in her more and more beaming face and quivering nose.
  4483	But if the count, getting more and more into the swing of it, charmed
  4484	the spectators by the unexpectedness of his adroit maneuvers and
  4485	the agility with which he capered about on his light feet, MÃ¡rya
  4486	DmÃ­trievna produced no less impression by slight exertionsâthe least
  4487	effort to move her shoulders or bend her arms when turning, or stamp
  4488	her footâwhich everyone appreciated in view of her size and habitual
  4489	severity. The dance grew livelier and livelier. The other couples could
  4490	not attract a momentâs attention to their own evolutions and did not
  4491	even try to do so. All were watching the count and MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna.
  4492	NatÃ¡sha kept pulling everyone by sleeve or dress, urging them to
  4493	âlook at Papa!â though as it was they never took their eyes off the
  4494	couple. In the intervals of the dance the count, breathing deeply, waved
  4495	and shouted to the musicians to play faster. Faster, faster, and faster;
  4496	lightly, more lightly, and yet more lightly whirled the count, flying
  4497	round MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna, now on his toes, now on his heels; until,
  4498	turning his partner round to her seat, he executed the final pas,
  4499	raising his soft foot backwards, bowing his perspiring head, smiling
  4500	and making a wide sweep with his arm, amid a thunder of applause and
  4501	laughter led by NatÃ¡sha. Both partners stood still, breathing heavily
  4502	and wiping their faces with their cambric handkerchiefs.
  4503	
  4504	âThatâs how we used to dance in our time, ma chÃ¨re,â said the
  4505	count.
  4506	
  4507	âThat was a Daniel Cooper!â exclaimed MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna, tucking up
  4508	her sleeves and puffing heavily.
  4509	
  4510	
  4511	
  4512	
  4513	
  4514	CHAPTER XXI
  4515	
  4516	While in the RostÃ³vsâ ballroom the sixth anglaise was being danced,
  4517	to a tune in which the weary musicians blundered, and while tired
  4518	footmen and cooks were getting the supper, Count BezÃºkhov had a
  4519	sixth stroke. The doctors pronounced recovery impossible. After a mute
  4520	confession, communion was administered to the dying man, preparations
  4521	made for the sacrament of unction, and in his house there was the bustle
  4522	and thrill of suspense usual at such moments. Outside the house, beyond
  4523	the gates, a group of undertakers, who hid whenever a carriage drove up,
  4524	waited in expectation of an important order for an expensive funeral.
  4525	The Military Governor of Moscow, who had been assiduous in sending
  4526	aides-de-camp to inquire after the countâs health, came himself
  4527	that evening to bid a last farewell to the celebrated grandee of
  4528	Catherineâs court, Count BezÃºkhov.
  4529	
  4530	The magnificent reception room was crowded. Everyone stood up
  4531	respectfully when the Military Governor, having stayed about half an
  4532	hour alone with the dying man, passed out, slightly acknowledging their
  4533	bows and trying to escape as quickly as possible from the glances fixed
  4534	on him by the doctors, clergy, and relatives of the family. Prince
  4535	VasÃ­li, who had grown thinner and paler during the last few days,
  4536	escorted him to the door, repeating something to him several times in
  4537	low tones.
  4538	
  4539	When the Military Governor had gone, Prince VasÃ­li sat down all alone
  4540	on a chair in the ballroom, crossing one leg high over the other,
  4541	leaning his elbow on his knee and covering his face with his hand. After
  4542	sitting so for a while he rose, and, looking about him with frightened
  4543	eyes, went with unusually hurried steps down the long corridor leading
  4544	to the back of the house, to the room of the eldest princess.
  4545	
  4546	Those who were in the dimly lit reception room spoke in nervous
  4547	whispers, and, whenever anyone went into or came from the dying manâs
  4548	room, grew silent and gazed with eyes full of curiosity or expectancy at
  4549	his door, which creaked slightly when opened.
  4550	
  4551	âThe limits of human life ... are fixed and may not be
  4552	oâerpassed,â said an old priest to a lady who had taken a seat
  4553	beside him and was listening naÃ¯vely to his words.
  4554	
  4555	âI wonder, is it not too late to administer unction?â asked the
  4556	lady, adding the priestâs clerical title, as if she had no opinion of
  4557	her own on the subject.
  4558	
  4559	âAh, madam, it is a great sacrament,â replied the priest, passing
  4560	his hand over the thin grizzled strands of hair combed back across his
  4561	bald head.
  4562	
  4563	âWho was that? The Military Governor himself?â was being asked at
  4564	the other side of the room. âHow young-looking he is!â
  4565	
  4566	âYes, and he is over sixty. I hear the count no longer recognizes
  4567	anyone. They wished to administer the sacrament of unction.â
  4568	
  4569	âI knew someone who received that sacrament seven times.â
  4570	
  4571	The second princess had just come from the sickroom with her eyes red
  4572	from weeping and sat down beside Dr. Lorrain, who was sitting in a
  4573	graceful pose under a portrait of Catherine, leaning his elbow on a
  4574	table.
  4575	
  4576	âBeautiful,â said the doctor in answer to a remark about the
  4577	weather. âThe weather is beautiful, Princess; and besides, in Moscow
  4578	one feels as if one were in the country.â
  4579	
  4580	âYes, indeed,â replied the princess with a sigh. âSo he may have
  4581	something to drink?â
  4582	
  4583	Lorrain considered.
  4584	
  4585	âHas he taken his medicine?â
  4586	
  4587	âYes.â
  4588	
  4589	The doctor glanced at his watch.
  4590	
  4591	âTake a glass of boiled water and put a pinch of cream of tartar,â
  4592	and he indicated with his delicate fingers what he meant by a pinch.
  4593	
  4594	âDere has neffer been a gase,â a German doctor was saying to an
  4595	aide-de-camp, âdat one liffs after de sird stroke.â
  4596	
  4597	âAnd what a well-preserved man he was!â remarked the aide-de-camp.
  4598	âAnd who will inherit his wealth?â he added in a whisper.
  4599	
  4600	âIt vonât go begging,â replied the German with a smile.
  4601	
  4602	Everyone again looked toward the door, which creaked as the second
  4603	princess went in with the drink she had prepared according to
  4604	Lorrainâs instructions. The German doctor went up to Lorrain.
  4605	
  4606	âDo you think he can last till morning?â asked the German,
  4607	addressing Lorrain in French which he pronounced badly.
  4608	
  4609	Lorrain, pursing up his lips, waved a severely negative finger before
  4610	his nose.
  4611	
  4612	âTonight, not later,â said he in a low voice, and he moved away
  4613	with a decorous smile of self-satisfaction at being able clearly to
  4614	understand and state the patientâs condition.
  4615	
  4616	Meanwhile Prince VasÃ­li had opened the door into the princessâ room.
  4617	
  4618	In this room it was almost dark; only two tiny lamps were burning before
  4619	the icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt pastilles.
  4620	The room was crowded with small pieces of furniture, whatnots,
  4621	cupboards, and little tables. The quilt of a high, white feather bed was
  4622	just visible behind a screen. A small dog began to bark.
  4623	
  4624	âAh, is it you, cousin?â
  4625	
  4626	She rose and smoothed her hair, which was as usual so extremely smooth
  4627	that it seemed to be made of one piece with her head and covered with
  4628	varnish.
  4629	
  4630	âHas anything happened?â she asked. âI am so terrified.â
  4631	
  4632	âNo, there is no change. I only came to have a talk about business,
  4633	Catiche,â * muttered the prince, seating himself wearily on the chair
  4634	she had just vacated. âYou have made the place warm, I must say,â he
  4635	remarked. âWell, sit down: letâs have a talk.â
  4636	
  4637	     *Catherine.
  4638	
  4639	âI thought perhaps something had happened,â she said with her
  4640	unchanging stonily severe expression; and, sitting down opposite the
  4641	prince, she prepared to listen.
  4642	
  4643	âI wished to get a nap, mon cousin, but I canât.â
  4644	
  4645	âWell, my dear?â said Prince VasÃ­li, taking her hand and bending it
  4646	downwards as was his habit.
  4647	
  4648	It was plain that this âwell?â referred to much that they both
  4649	understood without naming.
  4650	
  4651	The princess, who had a straight, rigid body, abnormally long for her
  4652	legs, looked directly at Prince VasÃ­li with no sign of emotion in her
  4653	prominent gray eyes. Then she shook her head and glanced up at the icons
  4654	with a sigh. This might have been taken as an expression of sorrow
  4655	and devotion, or of weariness and hope of resting before long. Prince
  4656	VasÃ­li understood it as an expression of weariness.
  4657	
  4658	âAnd I?â he said; âdo you think it is easier for me? I am as worn
  4659	out as a post horse, but still I must have a talk with you, Catiche, a
  4660	very serious talk.â
  4661	
  4662	Prince VasÃ­li said no more and his cheeks began to twitch nervously,
  4663	now on one side, now on the other, giving his face an unpleasant
  4664	expression which was never to be seen on it in a drawing room. His eyes
  4665	too seemed strange; at one moment they looked impudently sly and at the
  4666	next glanced round in alarm.
  4667	
  4668	The princess, holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bony
  4669	hands, looked attentively into Prince VasÃ­liâs eyes evidently
  4670	resolved not to be the first to break silence, if she had to wait till
  4671	morning.
  4672	
  4673	âWell, you see, my dear princess and cousin, Catherine SemÃ«novna,â
  4674	continued Prince VasÃ­li, returning to his theme, apparently not
  4675	without an inner struggle; âat such a moment as this one must think
  4676	of everything. One must think of the future, of all of you... I love you
  4677	all, like children of my own, as you know.â
  4678	
  4679	The princess continued to look at him without moving, and with the same
  4680	dull expression.
  4681	
  4682	âAnd then of course my family has also to be considered,â Prince
  4683	VasÃ­li went on, testily pushing away a little table without looking at
  4684	her. âYou know, Catiche, that weâyou three sisters, MÃ¡montov, and
  4685	my wifeâare the countâs only direct heirs. I know, I know how hard
  4686	it is for you to talk or think of such matters. It is no easier for
  4687	me; but, my dear, I am getting on for sixty and must be prepared for
  4688	anything. Do you know I have sent for Pierre? The count,â pointing to
  4689	his portrait, âdefinitely demanded that he should be called.â
  4690	
  4691	Prince VasÃ­li looked questioningly at the princess, but could not make
  4692	out whether she was considering what he had just said or whether she was
  4693	simply looking at him.
  4694	
  4695	âThere is one thing I constantly pray God to grant, mon cousin,â she
  4696	replied, âand it is that He would be merciful to him and would allow
  4697	his noble soul peacefully to leave this...â
  4698	
  4699	âYes, yes, of course,â interrupted Prince VasÃ­li impatiently,
  4700	rubbing his bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little
  4701	table that he had pushed away. âBut... in short, the fact is... you
  4702	know yourself that last winter the count made a will by which he left
  4703	all his property, not to us his direct heirs, but to Pierre.â
  4704	
  4705	âHe has made wills enough!â quietly remarked the princess. âBut he
  4706	cannot leave the estate to Pierre. Pierre is illegitimate.â
  4707	
  4708	âBut, my dear,â said Prince VasÃ­li suddenly, clutching the little
  4709	table and becoming more animated and talking more rapidly: âwhat if
  4710	a letter has been written to the Emperor in which the count asks for
  4711	Pierreâs legitimation? Do you understand that in consideration of the
  4712	countâs services, his request would be granted?...â
  4713	
  4714	The princess smiled as people do who think they know more about the
  4715	subject under discussion than those they are talking with.
  4716	
  4717	âI can tell you more,â continued Prince VasÃ­li, seizing her hand,
  4718	âthat letter was written, though it was not sent, and the Emperor knew
  4719	of it. The only question is, has it been destroyed or not? If not, then
  4720	as soon as all is over,â and Prince VasÃ­li sighed to intimate what he
  4721	meant by the words all is over, âand the countâs papers are opened,
  4722	the will and letter will be delivered to the Emperor, and the petition
  4723	will certainly be granted. Pierre will get everything as the legitimate
  4724	son.â
  4725	
  4726	âAnd our share?â asked the princess smiling ironically, as if
  4727	anything might happen, only not that.
  4728	
  4729	âBut, my poor Catiche, it is as clear as daylight! He will then be the
  4730	legal heir to everything and you wonât get anything. You must know,
  4731	my dear, whether the will and letter were written, and whether they have
  4732	been destroyed or not. And if they have somehow been overlooked, you
  4733	ought to know where they are, and must find them, because...â
  4734	
  4735	âWhat next?â the princess interrupted, smiling sardonically and not
  4736	changing the expression of her eyes. âI am a woman, and you think we
  4737	are all stupid; but I know this: an illegitimate son cannot inherit...
  4738	un bÃ¢tard!â* she added, as if supposing that this translation of the
  4739	word would effectively prove to Prince VasÃ­li the invalidity of his
  4740	contention.
  4741	
  4742	     * A bastard.
  4743	
  4744	âWell, really, Catiche! Canât you understand! You are so
  4745	intelligent, how is it you donât see that if the count has written a
  4746	letter to the Emperor begging him to recognize Pierre as legitimate, it
  4747	follows that Pierre will not be Pierre but will become Count BezÃºkhov,
  4748	and will then inherit everything under the will? And if the will and
  4749	letter are not destroyed, then you will have nothing but the consolation
  4750	of having been dutiful et tout ce qui sâensuit!* Thatâs certain.â
  4751	
  4752	     * And all that follows therefrom.
  4753	
  4754	âI know the will was made, but I also know that it is invalid;
  4755	and you, mon cousin, seem to consider me a perfect fool,â said the
  4756	princess with the expression women assume when they suppose they are
  4757	saying something witty and stinging.
  4758	
  4759	âMy dear Princess Catherine SemÃ«novna,â began Prince VasÃ­li
  4760	impatiently, âI came here not to wrangle with you, but to talk about
  4761	your interests as with a kinswoman, a good, kind, true relation. And I
  4762	tell you for the tenth time that if the letter to the Emperor and the
  4763	will in Pierreâs favor are among the countâs papers, then, my dear
  4764	girl, you and your sisters are not heiresses! If you donât believe me,
  4765	then believe an expert. I have just been talking to DmÃ­tri OnÃºfrichâ
  4766	(the family solicitor) âand he says the same.â
  4767	
  4768	At this a sudden change evidently took place in the princessâ ideas;
  4769	her thin lips grew white, though her eyes did not change, and her voice
  4770	when she began to speak passed through such transitions as she herself
  4771	evidently did not expect.
  4772	
  4773	âThat would be a fine thing!â said she. âI never wanted anything
  4774	and I donât now.â
  4775	
  4776	She pushed the little dog off her lap and smoothed her dress.
  4777	
  4778	âAnd this is gratitudeâthis is recognition for those who have
  4779	sacrificed everything for his sake!â she cried. âItâs splendid!
  4780	Fine! I donât want anything, Prince.â
  4781	
  4782	âYes, but you are not the only one. There are your sisters...â
  4783	replied Prince VasÃ­li.
  4784	
  4785	But the princess did not listen to him.
  4786	
  4787	âYes, I knew it long ago but had forgotten. I knew that I could expect
  4788	nothing but meanness, deceit, envy, intrigue, and ingratitudeâthe
  4789	blackest ingratitudeâin this house...â
  4790	
  4791	âDo you or do you not know where that will is?â insisted Prince
  4792	VasÃ­li, his cheeks twitching more than ever.
  4793	
  4794	âYes, I was a fool! I still believed in people, loved them, and
  4795	sacrificed myself. But only the base, the vile succeed! I know who has
  4796	been intriguing!â
  4797	
  4798	The princess wished to rise, but the prince held her by the hand. She
  4799	had the air of one who has suddenly lost faith in the whole human race.
  4800	She gave her companion an angry glance.
  4801	
  4802	âThere is still time, my dear. You must remember, Catiche, that it was
  4803	all done casually in a moment of anger, of illness, and was afterwards
  4804	forgotten. Our duty, my dear, is to rectify his mistake, to ease his
  4805	last moments by not letting him commit this injustice, and not to let
  4806	him die feeling that he is rendering unhappy those who...â
  4807	
  4808	âWho sacrificed everything for him,â chimed in the princess, who
  4809	would again have risen had not the prince still held her fast, âthough
  4810	he never could appreciate it. No, mon cousin,â she added with a sigh,
  4811	âI shall always remember that in this world one must expect no reward,
  4812	that in this world there is neither honor nor justice. In this world one
  4813	has to be cunning and cruel.â
  4814	
  4815	âNow come, come! Be reasonable. I know your excellent heart.â
  4816	
  4817	âNo, I have a wicked heart.â
  4818	
  4819	âI know your heart,â repeated the prince. âI value your friendship
  4820	and wish you to have as good an opinion of me. Donât upset yourself,
  4821	and let us talk sensibly while there is still time, be it a day or be it
  4822	but an hour.... Tell me all you know about the will, and above all where
  4823	it is. You must know. We will take it at once and show it to the
  4824	count. He has, no doubt, forgotten it and will wish to destroy it.
  4825	You understand that my sole desire is conscientiously to carry out his
  4826	wishes; that is my only reason for being here. I came simply to help him
  4827	and you.â
  4828	
  4829	âNow I see it all! I know who has been intriguingâI know!â cried
  4830	the princess.
  4831	
  4832	âThatâs not the point, my dear.â
  4833	
  4834	âItâs that protÃ©gÃ© of yours, that sweet Princess DrubetskÃ¡ya,
  4835	that Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna whom I would not take for a housemaid... the
  4836	infamous, vile woman!â
  4837	
  4838	âDo not let us lose any time...â
  4839	
  4840	âAh, donât talk to me! Last winter she wheedled herself in here and
  4841	told the count such vile, disgraceful things about us, especially about
  4842	SophieâI canât repeat themâthat it made the count quite ill and he
  4843	would not see us for a whole fortnight. I know it was then he wrote this
  4844	vile, infamous paper, but I thought the thing was invalid.â
  4845	
  4846	âWeâve got to it at lastâwhy did you not tell me about it
  4847	sooner?â
  4848	
  4849	âItâs in the inlaid portfolio that he keeps under his pillow,â
  4850	said the princess, ignoring his question. âNow I know! Yes; if I have
  4851	a sin, a great sin, it is hatred of that vile woman!â almost shrieked
  4852	the princess, now quite changed. âAnd what does she come worming
  4853	herself in here for? But I will give her a piece of my mind. The time
  4854	will come!â
  4855	
  4856	
  4857	
  4858	
  4859	
  4860	CHAPTER XXII
  4861	
  4862	While these conversations were going on in the reception room and the
  4863	princessâ room, a carriage containing Pierre (who had been sent for)
  4864	and Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna (who found it necessary to accompany him) was
  4865	driving into the court of Count BezÃºkhovâs house. As the wheels
  4866	rolled softly over the straw beneath the windows, Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna,
  4867	having turned with words of comfort to her companion, realized that
  4868	he was asleep in his corner and woke him up. Rousing himself, Pierre
  4869	followed Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna out of the carriage, and only then began
  4870	to think of the interview with his dying father which awaited him. He
  4871	noticed that they had not come to the front entrance but to the back
  4872	door. While he was getting down from the carriage steps two men, who
  4873	looked like tradespeople, ran hurriedly from the entrance and hid in the
  4874	shadow of the wall. Pausing for a moment, Pierre noticed several other
  4875	men of the same kind hiding in the shadow of the house on both sides.
  4876	But neither Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna nor the footman nor the coachman, who
  4877	could not help seeing these people, took any notice of them. âIt seems
  4878	to be all right,â Pierre concluded, and followed Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna.
  4879	She hurriedly ascended the narrow dimly lit stone staircase, calling to
  4880	Pierre, who was lagging behind, to follow. Though he did not see why it
  4881	was necessary for him to go to the count at all, still less why he had
  4882	to go by the back stairs, yet judging by Anna MikhÃ¡ylovnaâs air
  4883	of assurance and haste, Pierre concluded that it was all absolutely
  4884	necessary. Halfway up the stairs they were almost knocked over by
  4885	some men who, carrying pails, came running downstairs, their boots
  4886	clattering. These men pressed close to the wall to let Pierre and Anna
  4887	MikhÃ¡ylovna pass and did not evince the least surprise at seeing them
  4888	there.
  4889	
  4890	âIs this the way to the princessesâ apartments?â asked Anna
  4891	MikhÃ¡ylovna of one of them.
  4892	
  4893	âYes,â replied a footman in a bold loud voice, as if anything were
  4894	now permissible; âthe door to the left, maâam.â
  4895	
  4896	âPerhaps the count did not ask for me,â said Pierre when he reached
  4897	the landing. âIâd better go to my own room.â
  4898	
  4899	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna paused and waited for him to come up.
  4900	
  4901	âAh, my friend!â she said, touching his arm as she had done her
  4902	sonâs when speaking to him that afternoon, âbelieve me I suffer no
  4903	less than you do, but be a man!â
  4904	
  4905	âBut really, hadnât I better go away?â he asked, looking kindly at
  4906	her over his spectacles.
  4907	
  4908	âAh, my dear friend! Forget the wrongs that may have been done you.
  4909	Think that he is your father ... perhaps in the agony of death.â She
  4910	sighed. âI have loved you like a son from the first. Trust yourself to
  4911	me, Pierre. I shall not forget your interests.â
  4912	
  4913	Pierre did not understand a word, but the conviction that all this had
  4914	to be grew stronger, and he meekly followed Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna who was
  4915	already opening a door.
  4916	
  4917	This door led into a back anteroom. An old man, a servant of the
  4918	princesses, sat in a corner knitting a stocking. Pierre had never been
  4919	in this part of the house and did not even know of the existence of
  4920	these rooms. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, addressing a maid who was hurrying past
  4921	with a decanter on a tray as âmy dearâ and âmy sweet,â asked
  4922	about the princessâ health and then led Pierre along a stone passage.
  4923	The first door on the left led into the princessesâ apartments. The
  4924	maid with the decanter in her haste had not closed the door (everything
  4925	in the house was done in haste at that time), and Pierre and Anna
  4926	MikhÃ¡ylovna in passing instinctively glanced into the room, where
  4927	Prince VasÃ­li and the eldest princess were sitting close together
  4928	talking. Seeing them pass, Prince VasÃ­li drew back with obvious
  4929	impatience, while the princess jumped up and with a gesture of
  4930	desperation slammed the door with all her might.
  4931	
  4932	This action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear depicted on
  4933	Prince VasÃ­liâs face so out of keeping with his dignity that Pierre
  4934	stopped and glanced inquiringly over his spectacles at his guide. Anna
  4935	MikhÃ¡ylovna evinced no surprise, she only smiled faintly and sighed, as
  4936	if to say that this was no more than she had expected.
  4937	
  4938	âBe a man, my friend. I will look after your interests,â said she in
  4939	reply to his look, and went still faster along the passage.
  4940	
  4941	Pierre could not make out what it was all about, and still less what
  4942	âwatching over his interestsâ meant, but he decided that all these
  4943	things had to be. From the passage they went into a large, dimly
  4944	lit room adjoining the countâs reception room. It was one of those
  4945	sumptuous but cold apartments known to Pierre only from the front
  4946	approach, but even in this room there now stood an empty bath, and water
  4947	had been spilled on the carpet. They were met by a deacon with a censer
  4948	and by a servant who passed out on tiptoe without heeding them. They
  4949	went into the reception room familiar to Pierre, with two Italian
  4950	windows opening into the conservatory, with its large bust and full
  4951	length portrait of Catherine the Great. The same people were still
  4952	sitting here in almost the same positions as before, whispering to one
  4953	another. All became silent and turned to look at the pale tear-worn Anna
  4954	MikhÃ¡ylovna as she entered, and at the big stout figure of Pierre who,
  4955	hanging his head, meekly followed her.
  4956	
  4957	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovnaâs face expressed a consciousness that the decisive
  4958	moment had arrived. With the air of a practical Petersburg lady she now,
  4959	keeping Pierre close beside her, entered the room even more boldly than
  4960	that afternoon. She felt that as she brought with her the person the
  4961	dying man wished to see, her own admission was assured. Casting a rapid
  4962	glance at all those in the room and noticing the countâs confessor
  4963	there, she glided up to him with a sort of amble, not exactly bowing yet
  4964	seeming to grow suddenly smaller, and respectfully received the blessing
  4965	first of one and then of another priest.
  4966	
  4967	âGod be thanked that you are in time,â said she to one of the
  4968	priests; âall we relatives have been in such anxiety. This young
  4969	man is the countâs son,â she added more softly. âWhat a terrible
  4970	moment!â
  4971	
  4972	Having said this she went up to the doctor.
  4973	
  4974	âDear doctor,â said she, âthis young man is the countâs son. Is
  4975	there any hope?â
  4976	
  4977	The doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and silently shrugged his
  4978	shoulders. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna with just the same movement raised her
  4979	shoulders and eyes, almost closing the latter, sighed, and moved away
  4980	from the doctor to Pierre. To him, in a particularly respectful and
  4981	tenderly sad voice, she said:
  4982	
  4983	âTrust in His mercy!â and pointing out a small sofa for him to sit
  4984	and wait for her, she went silently toward the door that everyone was
  4985	watching and it creaked very slightly as she disappeared behind it.
  4986	
  4987	Pierre, having made up his mind to obey his monitress implicitly, moved
  4988	toward the sofa she had indicated. As soon as Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna had
  4989	disappeared he noticed that the eyes of all in the room turned to him
  4990	with something more than curiosity and sympathy. He noticed that they
  4991	whispered to one another, casting significant looks at him with a kind
  4992	of awe and even servility. A deference such as he had never before
  4993	received was shown him. A strange lady, the one who had been talking to
  4994	the priests, rose and offered him her seat; an aide-de-camp picked up
  4995	and returned a glove Pierre had dropped; the doctors became respectfully
  4996	silent as he passed by, and moved to make way for him. At first Pierre
  4997	wished to take another seat so as not to trouble the lady, and also to
  4998	pick up the glove himself and to pass round the doctors who were not
  4999	even in his way; but all at once he felt that this would not do, and
  5000	that tonight he was a person obliged to perform some sort of awful
  5001	rite which everyone expected of him, and that he was therefore bound
  5002	to accept their services. He took the glove in silence from the
  5003	aide-de-camp, and sat down in the ladyâs chair, placing his huge hands
  5004	symmetrically on his knees in the naÃ¯ve attitude of an Egyptian statue,
  5005	and decided in his own mind that all was as it should be, and that in
  5006	order not to lose his head and do foolish things he must not act on his
  5007	own ideas tonight, but must yield himself up entirely to the will of
  5008	those who were guiding him.
  5009	
  5010	Not two minutes had passed before Prince VasÃ­li with head erect
  5011	majestically entered the room. He was wearing his long coat with three
  5012	stars on his breast. He seemed to have grown thinner since the morning;
  5013	his eyes seemed larger than usual when he glanced round and noticed
  5014	Pierre. He went up to him, took his hand (a thing he never used to do),
  5015	and drew it downwards as if wishing to ascertain whether it was firmly
  5016	fixed on.
  5017	
  5018	âCourage, courage, my friend! He has asked to see you. That is
  5019	well!â and he turned to go.
  5020	
  5021	But Pierre thought it necessary to ask: âHow is...â and hesitated,
  5022	not knowing whether it would be proper to call the dying man âthe
  5023	count,â yet ashamed to call him âfather.â
  5024	
  5025	âHe had another stroke about half an hour ago. Courage, my
  5026	friend...â
  5027	
  5028	Pierreâs mind was in such a confused state that the word âstrokeâ
  5029	suggested to him a blow from something. He looked at Prince VasÃ­li
  5030	in perplexity, and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack of
  5031	illness. Prince VasÃ­li said something to Lorrain in passing and went
  5032	through the door on tiptoe. He could not walk well on tiptoe and his
  5033	whole body jerked at each step. The eldest princess followed him, and
  5034	the priests and deacons and some servants also went in at the door.
  5035	Through that door was heard a noise of things being moved about, and
  5036	at last Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, still with the same expression, pale but
  5037	resolute in the discharge of duty, ran out and touching Pierre lightly
  5038	on the arm said:
  5039	
  5040	âThe divine mercy is inexhaustible! Unction is about to be
  5041	administered. Come.â
  5042	
  5043	Pierre went in at the door, stepping on the soft carpet, and noticed
  5044	that the strange lady, the aide-de-camp, and some of the servants, all
  5045	followed him in, as if there were now no further need for permission to
  5046	enter that room.
  5047	
  5048	
  5049	
  5050	
  5051	
  5052	CHAPTER XXIII
  5053	
  5054	Pierre well knew this large room divided by columns and an arch, its
  5055	walls hung round with Persian carpets. The part of the room behind the
  5056	columns, with a high silk-curtained mahogany bedstead on one side and
  5057	on the other an immense case containing icons, was brightly illuminated
  5058	with red light like a Russian church during evening service. Under
  5059	the gleaming icons stood a long invalid chair, and in that chair
  5060	on snowy-white smooth pillows, evidently freshly changed, Pierre
  5061	sawâcovered to the waist by a bright green quiltâthe familiar,
  5062	majestic figure of his father, Count BezÃºkhov, with that gray mane of
  5063	hair above his broad forehead which reminded one of a lion, and the deep
  5064	characteristically noble wrinkles of his handsome, ruddy face. He lay
  5065	just under the icons; his large thick hands outside the quilt. Into the
  5066	right hand, which was lying palm downwards, a wax taper had been thrust
  5067	between forefinger and thumb, and an old servant, bending over from
  5068	behind the chair, held it in position. By the chair stood the priests,
  5069	their long hair falling over their magnificent glittering vestments,
  5070	with lighted tapers in their hands, slowly and solemnly conducting the
  5071	service. A little behind them stood the two younger princesses holding
  5072	handkerchiefs to their eyes, and just in front of them their eldest
  5073	sister, Catiche, with a vicious and determined look steadily fixed on
  5074	the icons, as though declaring to all that she could not answer for
  5075	herself should she glance round. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, with a meek,
  5076	sorrowful, and all-forgiving expression on her face, stood by the door
  5077	near the strange lady. Prince VasÃ­li in front of the door, near the
  5078	invalid chair, a wax taper in his left hand, was leaning his left arm on
  5079	the carved back of a velvet chair he had turned round for the purpose,
  5080	and was crossing himself with his right hand, turning his eyes upward
  5081	each time he touched his forehead. His face wore a calm look of piety
  5082	and resignation to the will of God. âIf you do not understand these
  5083	sentiments,â he seemed to be saying, âso much the worse for you!â
  5084	
  5085	Behind him stood the aide-de-camp, the doctors, and the menservants;
  5086	the men and women had separated as in church. All were silently crossing
  5087	themselves, and the reading of the church service, the subdued chanting
  5088	of deep bass voices, and in the intervals sighs and the shuffling of
  5089	feet were the only sounds that could be heard. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, with
  5090	an air of importance that showed that she felt she quite knew what she
  5091	was about, went across the room to where Pierre was standing and gave
  5092	him a taper. He lit it and, distracted by observing those around him,
  5093	began crossing himself with the hand that held the taper.
  5094	
  5095	Sophie, the rosy, laughter-loving, youngest princess with the mole,
  5096	watched him. She smiled, hid her face in her handkerchief, and remained
  5097	with it hidden for awhile; then looking up and seeing Pierre she
  5098	again began to laugh. She evidently felt unable to look at him
  5099	without laughing, but could not resist looking at him: so to be out of
  5100	temptation she slipped quietly behind one of the columns. In the midst
  5101	of the service the voices of the priests suddenly ceased, they whispered
  5102	to one another, and the old servant who was holding the countâs hand
  5103	got up and said something to the ladies. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna stepped
  5104	forward and, stooping over the dying man, beckoned to Lorrain from
  5105	behind her back. The French doctor held no taper; he was leaning
  5106	against one of the columns in a respectful attitude implying that he,
  5107	a foreigner, in spite of all differences of faith, understood the full
  5108	importance of the rite now being performed and even approved of it. He
  5109	now approached the sick man with the noiseless step of one in full vigor
  5110	of life, with his delicate white fingers raised from the green quilt the
  5111	hand that was free, and turning sideways felt the pulse and reflected
  5112	a moment. The sick man was given something to drink, there was a
  5113	stir around him, then the people resumed their places and the service
  5114	continued. During this interval Pierre noticed that Prince VasÃ­li
  5115	left the chair on which he had been leaning, andâwith an air
  5116	which intimated that he knew what he was about and if others did not
  5117	understand him it was so much the worse for themâdid not go up to the
  5118	dying man, but passed by him, joined the eldest princess, and moved
  5119	with her to the side of the room where stood the high bedstead with its
  5120	silken hangings. On leaving the bed both Prince VasÃ­li and the princess
  5121	passed out by a back door, but returned to their places one after the
  5122	other before the service was concluded. Pierre paid no more attention
  5123	to this occurrence than to the rest of what went on, having made up his
  5124	mind once for all that what he saw happening around him that evening was
  5125	in some way essential.
  5126	
  5127	The chanting of the service ceased, and the voice of the priest was
  5128	heard respectfully congratulating the dying man on having received the
  5129	sacrament. The dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as before. Around
  5130	him everyone began to stir: steps were audible and whispers, among which
  5131	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovnaâs was the most distinct.
  5132	
  5133	Pierre heard her say:
  5134	
  5135	âCertainly he must be moved onto the bed; here it will be
  5136	impossible...â
  5137	
  5138	The sick man was so surrounded by doctors, princesses, and servants
  5139	that Pierre could no longer see the reddish-yellow face with its gray
  5140	maneâwhich, though he saw other faces as well, he had not lost sight
  5141	of for a single moment during the whole service. He judged by the
  5142	cautious movements of those who crowded round the invalid chair that
  5143	they had lifted the dying man and were moving him.
  5144	
  5145	âCatch hold of my arm or youâll drop him!â he heard one of the
  5146	servants say in a frightened whisper. âCatch hold from underneath.
  5147	Here!â exclaimed different voices; and the heavy breathing of the
  5148	bearers and the shuffling of their feet grew more hurried, as if the
  5149	weight they were carrying were too much for them.
  5150	
  5151	As the bearers, among whom was Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, passed the young man
  5152	he caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the dying
  5153	manâs high, stout, uncovered chest and powerful shoulders, raised by
  5154	those who were holding him under the armpits, and of his gray, curly,
  5155	leonine head. This head, with its remarkably broad brow and cheekbones,
  5156	its handsome, sensual mouth, and its cold, majestic expression, was
  5157	not disfigured by the approach of death. It was the same as Pierre
  5158	remembered it three months before, when the count had sent him to
  5159	Petersburg. But now this head was swaying helplessly with the uneven
  5160	movements of the bearers, and the cold listless gaze fixed itself upon
  5161	nothing.
  5162	
  5163	After a few minutesâ bustle beside the high bedstead, those who had
  5164	carried the sick man dispersed. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna touched Pierreâs
  5165	hand and said, âCome.â Pierre went with her to the bed on which the
  5166	sick man had been laid in a stately pose in keeping with the ceremony
  5167	just completed. He lay with his head propped high on the pillows. His
  5168	hands were symmetrically placed on the green silk quilt, the palms
  5169	downward. When Pierre came up the count was gazing straight at him, but
  5170	with a look the significance of which could not be understood by mortal
  5171	man. Either this look meant nothing but that as long as one has eyes
  5172	they must look somewhere, or it meant too much. Pierre hesitated,
  5173	not knowing what to do, and glanced inquiringly at his guide. Anna
  5174	MikhÃ¡ylovna made a hurried sign with her eyes, glancing at the sick
  5175	manâs hand and moving her lips as if to send it a kiss. Pierre,
  5176	carefully stretching his neck so as not to touch the quilt, followed her
  5177	suggestion and pressed his lips to the large boned, fleshy hand. Neither
  5178	the hand nor a single muscle of the countâs face stirred. Once more
  5179	Pierre looked questioningly at Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna to see what he was to
  5180	do next. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna with her eyes indicated a chair that stood
  5181	beside the bed. Pierre obediently sat down, his eyes asking if he were
  5182	doing right. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna nodded approvingly. Again Pierre fell
  5183	into the naÃ¯vely symmetrical pose of an Egyptian statue, evidently
  5184	distressed that his stout and clumsy body took up so much room and doing
  5185	his utmost to look as small as possible. He looked at the count, who
  5186	still gazed at the spot where Pierreâs face had been before he sat
  5187	down. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna indicated by her attitude her consciousness of
  5188	the pathetic importance of these last moments of meeting between the
  5189	father and son. This lasted about two minutes, which to Pierre seemed an
  5190	hour. Suddenly the broad muscles and lines of the countâs face began
  5191	to twitch. The twitching increased, the handsome mouth was drawn to one
  5192	side (only now did Pierre realize how near death his father was), and
  5193	from that distorted mouth issued an indistinct, hoarse sound. Anna
  5194	MikhÃ¡ylovna looked attentively at the sick manâs eyes, trying to
  5195	guess what he wanted; she pointed first to Pierre, then to some drink,
  5196	then named Prince VasÃ­li in an inquiring whisper, then pointed to the
  5197	quilt. The eyes and face of the sick man showed impatience. He made an
  5198	effort to look at the servant who stood constantly at the head of the
  5199	bed.
  5200	
  5201	âWants to turn on the other side,â whispered the servant, and got up
  5202	to turn the countâs heavy body toward the wall.
  5203	
  5204	Pierre rose to help him.
  5205	
  5206	While the count was being turned over, one of his arms fell back
  5207	helplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward. Whether he
  5208	noticed the look of terror with which Pierre regarded that lifeless arm,
  5209	or whether some other thought flitted across his dying brain, at any
  5210	rate he glanced at the refractory arm, at Pierreâs terror-stricken
  5211	face, and again at the arm, and on his face a feeble, piteous smile
  5212	appeared, quite out of keeping with his features, that seemed to deride
  5213	his own helplessness. At sight of this smile Pierre felt an unexpected
  5214	quivering in his breast and a tickling in his nose, and tears dimmed his
  5215	eyes. The sick man was turned on to his side with his face to the wall.
  5216	He sighed.
  5217	
  5218	âHe is dozing,â said Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, observing that one of the
  5219	princesses was coming to take her turn at watching. âLet us go.â
  5220	
  5221	Pierre went out.
  5222	
  5223	
  5224	
  5225	
  5226	
  5227	CHAPTER XXIV
  5228	
  5229	There was now no one in the reception room except Prince VasÃ­li and the
  5230	eldest princess, who were sitting under the portrait of Catherine the
  5231	Great and talking eagerly. As soon as they saw Pierre and his companion
  5232	they became silent, and Pierre thought he saw the princess hide
  5233	something as she whispered:
  5234	
  5235	âI canât bear the sight of that woman.â
  5236	
  5237	âCatiche has had tea served in the small drawing room,â said Prince
  5238	VasÃ­li to Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna. âGo and take something, my poor Anna
  5239	MikhÃ¡ylovna, or you will not hold out.â
  5240	
  5241	To Pierre he said nothing, merely giving his arm a sympathetic squeeze
  5242	below the shoulder. Pierre went with Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna into the small
  5243	drawing room.
  5244	
  5245	âThere is nothing so refreshing after a sleepless night as a cup
  5246	of this delicious Russian tea,â Lorrain was saying with an air of
  5247	restrained animation as he stood sipping tea from a delicate Chinese
  5248	handleless cup before a table on which tea and a cold supper were laid
  5249	in the small circular room. Around the table all who were at Count
  5250	BezÃºkhovâs house that night had gathered to fortify themselves.
  5251	Pierre well remembered this small circular drawing room with its mirrors
  5252	and little tables. During balls given at the house Pierre, who did not
  5253	know how to dance, had liked sitting in this room to watch the ladies
  5254	who, as they passed through in their ball dresses with diamonds and
  5255	pearls on their bare shoulders, looked at themselves in the brilliantly
  5256	lighted mirrors which repeated their reflections several times. Now
  5257	this same room was dimly lighted by two candles. On one small table tea
  5258	things and supper dishes stood in disorder, and in the middle of the
  5259	night a motley throng of people sat there, not merrymaking, but somberly
  5260	whispering, and betraying by every word and movement that they none
  5261	of them forgot what was happening and what was about to happen in the
  5262	bedroom. Pierre did not eat anything though he would very much have
  5263	liked to. He looked inquiringly at his monitress and saw that she was
  5264	again going on tiptoe to the reception room where they had left Prince
  5265	VasÃ­li and the eldest princess. Pierre concluded that this also was
  5266	essential, and after a short interval followed her. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna
  5267	was standing beside the princess, and they were both speaking in excited
  5268	whispers.
  5269	
  5270	âPermit me, Princess, to know what is necessary and what is not
  5271	necessary,â said the younger of the two speakers, evidently in the
  5272	same state of excitement as when she had slammed the door of her room.
  5273	
  5274	âBut, my dear princess,â answered Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna blandly but
  5275	impressively, blocking the way to the bedroom and preventing the other
  5276	from passing, âwonât this be too much for poor Uncle at a moment
  5277	when he needs repose? Worldly conversation at a moment when his soul is
  5278	already prepared...â
  5279	
  5280	Prince VasÃ­li was seated in an easy chair in his familiar attitude,
  5281	with one leg crossed high above the other. His cheeks, which were so
  5282	flabby that they looked heavier below, were twitching violently; but
  5283	he wore the air of a man little concerned in what the two ladies were
  5284	saying.
  5285	
  5286	âCome, my dear Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, let Catiche do as she pleases. You
  5287	know how fond the count is of her.â
  5288	
  5289	âI donât even know what is in this paper,â said the younger of
  5290	the two ladies, addressing Prince VasÃ­li and pointing to an inlaid
  5291	portfolio she held in her hand. âAll I know is that his real will is
  5292	in his writing table, and this is a paper he has forgotten....â
  5293	
  5294	She tried to pass Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, but the latter sprang so as to bar
  5295	her path.
  5296	
  5297	âI know, my dear, kind princess,â said Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, seizing
  5298	the portfolio so firmly that it was plain she would not let go easily.
  5299	âDear princess, I beg and implore you, have some pity on him! Je vous
  5300	en conjure...â
  5301	
  5302	The princess did not reply. Their efforts in the struggle for the
  5303	portfolio were the only sounds audible, but it was evident that if
  5304	the princess did speak, her words would not be flattering to Anna
  5305	MikhÃ¡ylovna. Though the latter held on tenaciously, her voice lost none
  5306	of its honeyed firmness and softness.
  5307	
  5308	âPierre, my dear, come here. I think he will not be out of place in a
  5309	family consultation; is it not so, Prince?â
  5310	
  5311	âWhy donât you speak, cousin?â suddenly shrieked the princess so
  5312	loud that those in the drawing room heard her and were startled. âWhy
  5313	do you remain silent when heaven knows who permits herself to
  5314	interfere, making a scene on the very threshold of a dying manâs room?
  5315	Intriguer!â she hissed viciously, and tugged with all her might at the
  5316	portfolio.
  5317	
  5318	But Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna went forward a step or two to keep her hold on the
  5319	portfolio, and changed her grip.
  5320	
  5321	Prince VasÃ­li rose. âOh!â said he with reproach and surprise,
  5322	âthis is absurd! Come, let go I tell you.â
  5323	
  5324	The princess let go.
  5325	
  5326	âAnd you too!â
  5327	
  5328	But Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna did not obey him.
  5329	
  5330	âLet go, I tell you! I will take the responsibility. I myself will go
  5331	and ask him, I!... does that satisfy you?â
  5332	
  5333	âBut, Prince,â said Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, âafter such a solemn
  5334	sacrament, allow him a momentâs peace! Here, Pierre, tell them your
  5335	opinion,â said she, turning to the young man who, having come quite
  5336	close, was gazing with astonishment at the angry face of the princess
  5337	which had lost all dignity, and at the twitching cheeks of Prince
  5338	VasÃ­li.
  5339	
  5340	âRemember that you will answer for the consequences,â said Prince
  5341	VasÃ­li severely. âYou donât know what you are doing.â
  5342	
  5343	âVile woman!â shouted the princess, darting unexpectedly at Anna
  5344	MikhÃ¡ylovna and snatching the portfolio from her.
  5345	
  5346	Prince VasÃ­li bent his head and spread out his hands.
  5347	
  5348	At this moment that terrible door, which Pierre had watched so long
  5349	and which had always opened so quietly, burst noisily open and banged
  5350	against the wall, and the second of the three sisters rushed out
  5351	wringing her hands.
  5352	
  5353	âWhat are you doing!â she cried vehemently. âHe is dying and you
  5354	leave me alone with him!â
  5355	
  5356	Her sister dropped the portfolio. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, stooping, quickly
  5357	caught up the object of contention and ran into the bedroom. The eldest
  5358	princess and Prince VasÃ­li, recovering themselves, followed her. A few
  5359	minutes later the eldest sister came out with a pale hard face, again
  5360	biting her underlip. At sight of Pierre her expression showed an
  5361	irrepressible hatred.
  5362	
  5363	âYes, now you may be glad!â said she; âthis is what you have
  5364	been waiting for.â And bursting into tears she hid her face in her
  5365	handkerchief and rushed from the room.
  5366	
  5367	Prince VasÃ­li came next. He staggered to the sofa on which Pierre was
  5368	sitting and dropped onto it, covering his face with his hand. Pierre
  5369	noticed that he was pale and that his jaw quivered and shook as if in an
  5370	ague.
  5371	
  5372	âAh, my friend!â said he, taking Pierre by the elbow; and there was
  5373	in his voice a sincerity and weakness Pierre had never observed in it
  5374	before. âHow often we sin, how much we deceive, and all for what? I am
  5375	near sixty, dear friend... I too... All will end in death, all! Death is
  5376	awful...â and he burst into tears.
  5377	
  5378	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna came out last. She approached Pierre with slow, quiet
  5379	steps.
  5380	
  5381	âPierre!â she said.
  5382	
  5383	Pierre gave her an inquiring look. She kissed the young man on his
  5384	forehead, wetting him with her tears. Then after a pause she said:
  5385	
  5386	âHe is no more....â
  5387	
  5388	Pierre looked at her over his spectacles.
  5389	
  5390	âCome, I will go with you. Try to weep, nothing gives such relief as
  5391	tears.â
  5392	
  5393	She led him into the dark drawing room and Pierre was glad no one could
  5394	see his face. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna left him, and when she returned he was
  5395	fast asleep with his head on his arm.
  5396	
  5397	In the morning Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna said to Pierre:
  5398	
  5399	âYes, my dear, this is a great loss for us all, not to speak of you.
  5400	But God will support you: you are young, and are now, I hope, in command
  5401	of an immense fortune. The will has not yet been opened. I know you
  5402	well enough to be sure that this will not turn your head, but it imposes
  5403	duties on you, and you must be a man.â
  5404	
  5405	Pierre was silent.
  5406	
  5407	âPerhaps later on I may tell you, my dear boy, that if I had not been
  5408	there, God only knows what would have happened! You know, Uncle promised
  5409	me only the day before yesterday not to forget BorÃ­s. But he had
  5410	no time. I hope, my dear friend, you will carry out your fatherâs
  5411	wish?â
  5412	
  5413	Pierre understood nothing of all this and coloring shyly looked in
  5414	silence at Princess Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna. After her talk with Pierre, Anna
  5415	MikhÃ¡ylovna returned to the RostÃ³vsâ and went to bed. On waking in
  5416	the morning she told the RostÃ³vs and all her acquaintances the details
  5417	of Count BezÃºkhovâs death. She said the count had died as she would
  5418	herself wish to die, that his end was not only touching but edifying. As
  5419	to the last meeting between father and son, it was so touching that she
  5420	could not think of it without tears, and did not know which had behaved
  5421	better during those awful momentsâthe father who so remembered
  5422	everything and everybody at last and had spoken such pathetic words to
  5423	the son, or Pierre, whom it had been pitiful to see, so stricken was he
  5424	with grief, though he tried hard to hide it in order not to sadden his
  5425	dying father. âIt is painful, but it does one good. It uplifts the
  5426	soul to see such men as the old count and his worthy son,â said she.
  5427	Of the behavior of the eldest princess and Prince VasÃ­li she spoke
  5428	disapprovingly, but in whispers and as a great secret.
  5429

  5434	CHAPTER XXV
  5435	
  5436	At Bald Hills, Prince Nicholas AndrÃ©evich BolkÃ³nskiâs estate, the
  5437	arrival of young Prince Andrew and his wife was daily expected, but
  5438	this expectation did not upset the regular routine of life in the old
  5439	princeâs household. General in Chief Prince Nicholas AndrÃ©evich
  5440	(nicknamed in society, âthe King of Prussiaâ) ever since the Emperor
  5441	Paul had exiled him to his country estate had lived there continuously
  5442	with his daughter, Princess Mary, and her companion, Mademoiselle
  5443	Bourienne. Though in the new reign he was free to return to the
  5444	capitals, he still continued to live in the country, remarking that
  5445	anyone who wanted to see him could come the hundred miles from Moscow to
  5446	Bald Hills, while he himself needed no one and nothing. He used to
  5447	say that there are only two sources of human viceâidleness and
  5448	superstition, and only two virtuesâactivity and intelligence. He
  5449	himself undertook his daughterâs education, and to develop these two
  5450	cardinal virtues in her gave her lessons in algebra and geometry
  5451	till she was twenty, and arranged her life so that her whole time was
  5452	occupied. He was himself always occupied: writing his memoirs, solving
  5453	problems in higher mathematics, turning snuffboxes on a lathe, working
  5454	in the garden, or superintending the building that was always going on
  5455	at his estate. As regularity is a prime condition facilitating activity,
  5456	regularity in his household was carried to the highest point of
  5457	exactitude. He always came to table under precisely the same conditions,
  5458	and not only at the same hour but at the same minute. With those about
  5459	him, from his daughter to his serfs, the prince was sharp and invariably
  5460	exacting, so that without being a hardhearted man he inspired such fear
  5461	and respect as few hardhearted men would have aroused. Although he was
  5462	in retirement and had now no influence in political affairs, every high
  5463	official appointed to the province in which the princeâs estate lay
  5464	considered it his duty to visit him and waited in the lofty antechamber
  5465	just as the architect, gardener, or Princess Mary did, till the prince
  5466	appeared punctually to the appointed hour. Everyone sitting in this
  5467	antechamber experienced the same feeling of respect and even fear when
  5468	the enormously high study door opened and showed the figure of a rather
  5469	small old man, with powdered wig, small withered hands, and bushy gray
  5470	eyebrows which, when he frowned, sometimes hid the gleam of his shrewd,
  5471	youthfully glittering eyes.
  5472	
  5473	On the morning of the day that the young couple were to arrive, Princess
  5474	Mary entered the antechamber as usual at the time appointed for the
  5475	morning greeting, crossing herself with trepidation and repeating a
  5476	silent prayer. Every morning she came in like that, and every morning
  5477	prayed that the daily interview might pass off well.
  5478	
  5479	An old powdered manservant who was sitting in the antechamber rose
  5480	quietly and said in a whisper: âPlease walk in.â
  5481	
  5482	Through the door came the regular hum of a lathe. The princess timidly
  5483	opened the door which moved noiselessly and easily. She paused at the
  5484	entrance. The prince was working at the lathe and after glancing round
  5485	continued his work.
  5486	
  5487	The enormous study was full of things evidently in constant use.
  5488	The large table covered with books and plans, the tall glass-fronted
  5489	bookcases with keys in the locks, the high desk for writing while
  5490	standing up, on which lay an open exercise book, and the lathe with
  5491	tools laid ready to hand and shavings scattered aroundâall indicated
  5492	continuous, varied, and orderly activity. The motion of the small foot
  5493	shod in a Tartar boot embroidered with silver, and the firm pressure
  5494	of the lean sinewy hand, showed that the prince still possessed the
  5495	tenacious endurance and vigor of hardy old age. After a few more turns
  5496	of the lathe he removed his foot from the pedal, wiped his chisel,
  5497	dropped it into a leather pouch attached to the lathe, and, approaching
  5498	the table, summoned his daughter. He never gave his children a blessing,
  5499	so he simply held out his bristly cheek (as yet unshaven) and, regarding
  5500	her tenderly and attentively, said severely:
  5501	
  5502	âQuite well? All right then, sit down.â He took the exercise book
  5503	containing lessons in geometry written by himself and drew up a chair
  5504	with his foot.
  5505	
  5506	âFor tomorrow!â said he, quickly finding the page and making a
  5507	scratch from one paragraph to another with his hard nail.
  5508	
  5509	The princess bent over the exercise book on the table.
  5510	
  5511	âWait a bit, hereâs a letter for you,â said the old man suddenly,
  5512	taking a letter addressed in a womanâs hand from a bag hanging above
  5513	the table, onto which he threw it.
  5514	
  5515	At the sight of the letter red patches showed themselves on the
  5516	princessâ face. She took it quickly and bent her head over it.
  5517	
  5518	âFrom HÃ©loÃ¯se?â asked the prince with a cold smile that showed his
  5519	still sound, yellowish teeth.
  5520	
  5521	âYes, itâs from Julie,â replied the princess with a timid glance
  5522	and a timid smile.
  5523	
  5524	âIâll let two more letters pass, but the third Iâll read,â said
  5525	the prince sternly; âIâm afraid you write much nonsense. Iâll read
  5526	the third!â
  5527	
  5528	âRead this if you like, Father,â said the princess, blushing still
  5529	more and holding out the letter.
  5530	
  5531	âThe third, I said the third!â cried the prince abruptly, pushing
  5532	the letter away, and leaning his elbows on the table he drew toward him
  5533	the exercise book containing geometrical figures.
  5534	
  5535	âWell, madam,â he began, stooping over the book close to his
  5536	daughter and placing an arm on the back of the chair on which she sat,
  5537	so that she felt herself surrounded on all sides by the acrid scent of
  5538	old age and tobacco, which she had known so long. âNow, madam, these
  5539	triangles are equal; please note that the angle ABC...â
  5540	
  5541	The princess looked in a scared way at her fatherâs eyes glittering
  5542	close to her; the red patches on her face came and went, and it was
  5543	plain that she understood nothing and was so frightened that her
  5544	fear would prevent her understanding any of her fatherâs further
  5545	explanations, however clear they might be. Whether it was the
  5546	teacherâs fault or the pupilâs, this same thing happened every day:
  5547	the princessâ eyes grew dim, she could not see and could not hear
  5548	anything, but was only conscious of her stern fatherâs withered face
  5549	close to her, of his breath and the smell of him, and could think only
  5550	of how to get away quickly to her own room to make out the problem in
  5551	peace. The old man was beside himself: moved the chair on which he was
  5552	sitting noisily backward and forward, made efforts to control himself
  5553	and not become vehement, but almost always did become vehement, scolded,
  5554	and sometimes flung the exercise book away.
  5555	
  5556	The princess gave a wrong answer.
  5557	
  5558	âWell now, isnât she a fool!â shouted the prince, pushing the book
  5559	aside and turning sharply away; but rising immediately, he paced up and
  5560	down, lightly touched his daughterâs hair and sat down again.
  5561	
  5562	He drew up his chair, and continued to explain.
  5563	
  5564	âThis wonât do, Princess; it wonât do,â said he, when Princess
  5565	Mary, having taken and closed the exercise book with the next dayâs
  5566	lesson, was about to leave: âMathematics are most important, madam!
  5567	I donât want to have you like our silly ladies. Get used to it and
  5568	youâll like it,â and he patted her cheek. âIt will drive all the
  5569	nonsense out of your head.â
  5570	
  5571	She turned to go, but he stopped her with a gesture and took an uncut
  5572	book from the high desk.
  5573	
  5574	âHere is some sort of Key to the Mysteries that your HÃ©loÃ¯se has
  5575	sent you. Religious! I donât interfere with anyoneâs belief... I
  5576	have looked at it. Take it. Well, now go. Go.â
  5577	
  5578	He patted her on the shoulder and himself closed the door after her.
  5579	
  5580	Princess Mary went back to her room with the sad, scared expression that
  5581	rarely left her and which made her plain, sickly face yet plainer. She
  5582	sat down at her writing table, on which stood miniature portraits and
  5583	which was littered with books and papers. The princess was as untidy as
  5584	her father was tidy. She put down the geometry book and eagerly broke
  5585	the seal of her letter. It was from her most intimate friend from
  5586	childhood; that same Julie KarÃ¡gina who had been at the RostÃ³vsâ
  5587	name-day party.
  5588	
  5589	Julie wrote in French:
  5590	
  5591	Dear and precious Friend, How terrible and frightful a thing is
  5592	separation! Though I tell myself that half my life and half my happiness
  5593	are wrapped up in you, and that in spite of the distance separating us
  5594	our hearts are united by indissoluble bonds, my heart rebels against
  5595	fate and in spite of the pleasures and distractions around me I cannot
  5596	overcome a certain secret sorrow that has been in my heart ever since
  5597	we parted. Why are we not together as we were last summer, in your big
  5598	study, on the blue sofa, the confidential sofa? Why cannot I now, as
  5599	three months ago, draw fresh moral strength from your look, so gentle,
  5600	calm, and penetrating, a look I loved so well and seem to see before me
  5601	as I write?
  5602	
  5603	Having read thus far, Princess Mary sighed and glanced into the mirror
  5604	which stood on her right. It reflected a weak, ungraceful figure and
  5605	thin face. Her eyes, always sad, now looked with particular hopelessness
  5606	at her reflection in the glass. âShe flatters me,â thought the
  5607	princess, turning away and continuing to read. But Julie did not flatter
  5608	her friend, the princessâ eyesâlarge, deep and luminous (it seemed
  5609	as if at times there radiated from them shafts of warm light)âwere
  5610	so beautiful that very often in spite of the plainness of her face
  5611	they gave her an attraction more powerful than that of beauty. But the
  5612	princess never saw the beautiful expression of her own eyesâthe look
  5613	they had when she was not thinking of herself. As with everyone, her
  5614	face assumed a forced unnatural expression as soon as she looked in a
  5615	glass. She went on reading:
  5616	
  5617	All Moscow talks of nothing but war. One of my two brothers is already
  5618	abroad, the other is with the Guards, who are starting on their march
  5619	to the frontier. Our dear Emperor has left Petersburg and it is thought
  5620	intends to expose his precious person to the chances of war. God grant
  5621	that the Corsican monster who is destroying the peace of Europe may
  5622	be overthrown by the angel whom it has pleased the Almighty, in His
  5623	goodness, to give us as sovereign! To say nothing of my brothers, this
  5624	war has deprived me of one of the associations nearest my heart. I mean
  5625	young Nicholas RostÃ³v, who with his enthusiasm could not bear to remain
  5626	inactive and has left the university to join the army. I will confess to
  5627	you, dear Mary, that in spite of his extreme youth his departure for
  5628	the army was a great grief to me. This young man, of whom I spoke to you
  5629	last summer, is so noble-minded and full of that real youthfulness which
  5630	one seldom finds nowadays among our old men of twenty and, particularly,
  5631	he is so frank and has so much heart. He is so pure and poetic that
  5632	my relations with him, transient as they were, have been one of the
  5633	sweetest comforts to my poor heart, which has already suffered so much.
  5634	Someday I will tell you about our parting and all that was said then.
  5635	That is still too fresh. Ah, dear friend, you are happy not to know
  5636	these poignant joys and sorrows. You are fortunate, for the latter are
  5637	generally the stronger! I know very well that Count Nicholas is too
  5638	young ever to be more to me than a friend, but this sweet friendship,
  5639	this poetic and pure intimacy, were what my heart needed. But enough of
  5640	this! The chief news, about which all Moscow gossips, is the death of
  5641	old Count BezÃºkhov, and his inheritance. Fancy! The three princesses
  5642	have received very little, Prince VasÃ­li nothing, and it is Monsieur
  5643	Pierre who has inherited all the property and has besides been
  5644	recognized as legitimate; so that he is now Count BezÃºkhov and
  5645	possessor of the finest fortune in Russia. It is rumored that Prince
  5646	VasÃ­li played a very despicable part in this affair and that he
  5647	returned to Petersburg quite crestfallen.
  5648	
  5649	I confess I understand very little about all these matters of wills and
  5650	inheritance; but I do know that since this young man, whom we all used
  5651	to know as plain Monsieur Pierre, has become Count BezÃºkhov and the
  5652	owner of one of the largest fortunes in Russia, I am much amused to
  5653	watch the change in the tone and manners of the mammas burdened by
  5654	marriageable daughters, and of the young ladies themselves, toward
  5655	him, though, between you and me, he always seemed to me a poor sort
  5656	of fellow. As for the past two years people have amused themselves
  5657	by finding husbands for me (most of whom I donât even know), the
  5658	matchmaking chronicles of Moscow now speak of me as the future Countess
  5659	BezÃºkhova. But you will understand that I have no desire for the post.
  5660	Ã propos of marriages: do you know that a while ago that universal
  5661	auntie Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna told me, under the seal of strict secrecy, of
  5662	a plan of marriage for you. It is neither more nor less than with Prince
  5663	VasÃ­liâs son Anatole, whom they wish to reform by marrying him to
  5664	someone rich and distinguÃ©e, and it is on you that his relationsâ
  5665	choice has fallen. I donât know what you will think of it, but
  5666	I consider it my duty to let you know of it. He is said to be very
  5667	handsome and a terrible scapegrace. That is all I have been able to find
  5668	out about him.
  5669	
  5670	But enough of gossip. I am at the end of my second sheet of paper, and
  5671	Mamma has sent for me to go and dine at the AprÃ¡ksinsâ. Read the
  5672	mystical book I am sending you; it has an enormous success here. Though
  5673	there are things in it difficult for the feeble human mind to grasp, it
  5674	is an admirable book which calms and elevates the soul. Adieu! Give
  5675	my respects to monsieur your father and my compliments to Mademoiselle
  5676	Bourienne. I embrace you as I love you.
  5677	
  5678	JULIE
  5679	
  5680	P.S. Let me have news of your brother and his charming little wife.
  5681	
  5682	The princess pondered awhile with a thoughtful smile and her luminous
  5683	eyes lit up so that her face was entirely transformed. Then she suddenly
  5684	rose and with her heavy tread went up to the table. She took a sheet of
  5685	paper and her hand moved rapidly over it. This is the reply she wrote,
  5686	also in French:
  5687	
  5688	Dear and precious Friend, Your letter of the 13th has given me great
  5689	delight. So you still love me, my romantic Julie? Separation, of which
  5690	you say so much that is bad, does not seem to have had its usual effect
  5691	on you. You complain of our separation. What then should I say, if I
  5692	dared complain, I who am deprived of all who are dear to me? Ah, if
  5693	we had not religion to console us life would be very sad. Why do you
  5694	suppose that I should look severely on your affection for that young
  5695	man? On such matters I am only severe with myself. I understand such
  5696	feelings in others, and if never having felt them I cannot approve of
  5697	them, neither do I condemn them. Only it seems to me that Christian
  5698	love, love of oneâs neighbor, love of oneâs enemy, is worthier,
  5699	sweeter, and better than the feelings which the beautiful eyes of a
  5700	young man can inspire in a romantic and loving young girl like yourself.
  5701	
  5702	The news of Count BezÃºkhovâs death reached us before your letter
  5703	and my father was much affected by it. He says the count was the last
  5704	representative but one of the great century, and that it is his own
  5705	turn now, but that he will do all he can to let his turn come as late as
  5706	possible. God preserve us from that terrible misfortune!
  5707	
  5708	I cannot agree with you about Pierre, whom I knew as a child. He always
  5709	seemed to me to have an excellent heart, and that is the quality I value
  5710	most in people. As to his inheritance and the part played by Prince
  5711	VasÃ­li, it is very sad for both. Ah, my dear friend, our divine
  5712	Saviourâs words, that it is easier for a camel to go through the
  5713	eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God, are
  5714	terribly true. I pity Prince VasÃ­li but am still more sorry for Pierre.
  5715	So young, and burdened with such richesâto what temptations he will be
  5716	exposed! If I were asked what I desire most on earth, it would be to be
  5717	poorer than the poorest beggar. A thousand thanks, dear friend, for the
  5718	volume you have sent me and which has such success in Moscow. Yet since
  5719	you tell me that among some good things it contains others which our
  5720	weak human understanding cannot grasp, it seems to me rather useless to
  5721	spend time in reading what is unintelligible and can therefore bear
  5722	no fruit. I never could understand the fondness some people have for
  5723	confusing their minds by dwelling on mystical books that merely awaken
  5724	their doubts and excite their imagination, giving them a bent for
  5725	exaggeration quite contrary to Christian simplicity. Let us rather read
  5726	the Epistles and Gospels. Let us not seek to penetrate what mysteries
  5727	they contain; for how can we, miserable sinners that we are, know the
  5728	terrible and holy secrets of Providence while we remain in this flesh
  5729	which forms an impenetrable veil between us and the Eternal? Let us
  5730	rather confine ourselves to studying those sublime rules which our
  5731	divine Saviour has left for our guidance here below. Let us try to
  5732	conform to them and follow them, and let us be persuaded that the less
  5733	we let our feeble human minds roam, the better we shall please God, who
  5734	rejects all knowledge that does not come from Him; and the less we seek
  5735	to fathom what He has been pleased to conceal from us, the sooner will
  5736	He vouchsafe its revelation to us through His divine Spirit.
  5737	
  5738	My father has not spoken to me of a suitor, but has only told me that he
  5739	has received a letter and is expecting a visit from Prince VasÃ­li. In
  5740	regard to this project of marriage for me, I will tell you, dear sweet
  5741	friend, that I look on marriage as a divine institution to which we must
  5742	conform. However painful it may be to me, should the Almighty lay
  5743	the duties of wife and mother upon me I shall try to perform them as
  5744	faithfully as I can, without disquieting myself by examining my feelings
  5745	toward him whom He may give me for husband.
  5746	
  5747	I have had a letter from my brother, who announces his speedy arrival
  5748	at Bald Hills with his wife. This pleasure will be but a brief one,
  5749	however, for he will leave us again to take part in this unhappy war
  5750	into which we have been drawn, God knows how or why. Not only where you
  5751	areâat the heart of affairs and of the worldâis the talk all of
  5752	war, even here amid fieldwork and the calm of natureâwhich townsfolk
  5753	consider characteristic of the countryârumors of war are heard
  5754	and painfully felt. My father talks of nothing but marches and
  5755	countermarches, things of which I understand nothing; and the day
  5756	before yesterday during my daily walk through the village I witnessed a
  5757	heartrending scene.... It was a convoy of conscripts enrolled from our
  5758	people and starting to join the army. You should have seen the state of
  5759	the mothers, wives, and children of the men who were going and should
  5760	have heard the sobs. It seems as though mankind has forgotten the
  5761	laws of its divine Saviour, Who preached love and forgiveness of
  5762	injuriesâand that men attribute the greatest merit to skill in killing
  5763	one another.
  5764	
  5765	Adieu, dear and kind friend; may our divine Saviour and His most Holy
  5766	Mother keep you in their holy and all-powerful care!
  5767	
  5768	MARY
  5769	
  5770	âAh, you are sending off a letter, Princess? I have already dispatched
  5771	mine. I have written to my poor mother,â said the smiling Mademoiselle
  5772	Bourienne rapidly, in her pleasant mellow tones and with guttural râs.
  5773	She brought into Princess Maryâs strenuous, mournful, and gloomy
  5774	world a quite different atmosphere, careless, lighthearted, and
  5775	self-satisfied.
  5776	
  5777	âPrincess, I must warn you,â she added, lowering her voice and
  5778	evidently listening to herself with pleasure, and speaking with
  5779	exaggerated grasseyement, âthe prince has been scolding Michael
  5780	IvÃ¡novich. He is in a very bad humor, very morose. Be prepared.â
  5781	
  5782	âAh, dear friend,â replied Princess Mary, âI have asked you never
  5783	to warn me of the humor my father is in. I do not allow myself to judge
  5784	him and would not have others do so.â
  5785	
  5786	The princess glanced at her watch and, seeing that she was five minutes
  5787	late in starting her practice on the clavichord, went into the sitting
  5788	room with a look of alarm. Between twelve and two oâclock, as the
  5789	day was mapped out, the prince rested and the princess played the
  5790	clavichord.

  5796	CHAPTER XXVI
  5797	
  5798	The gray-haired valet was sitting drowsily listening to the snoring of
  5799	the prince, who was in his large study. From the far side of the house
  5800	through the closed doors came the sound of difficult passagesâtwenty
  5801	times repeatedâof a sonata by Dussek.
  5802	
  5803	Just then a closed carriage and another with a hood drove up to the
  5804	porch. Prince Andrew got out of the carriage, helped his little wife to
  5805	alight, and let her pass into the house before him. Old TÃ­khon, wearing
  5806	a wig, put his head out of the door of the antechamber, reported in
  5807	a whisper that the prince was sleeping, and hastily closed the door.
  5808	TÃ­khon knew that neither the sonâs arrival nor any other unusual
  5809	event must be allowed to disturb the appointed order of the day. Prince
  5810	Andrew apparently knew this as well as TÃ­khon; he looked at his watch
  5811	as if to ascertain whether his fatherâs habits had changed since he
  5812	was at home last, and, having assured himself that they had not, he
  5813	turned to his wife.
  5814	
  5815	âHe will get up in twenty minutes. Let us go across to Maryâs
  5816	room,â he said.
  5817	
  5818	The little princess had grown stouter during this time, but her eyes
  5819	and her short, downy, smiling lip lifted when she began to speak just as
  5820	merrily and prettily as ever.
  5821	
  5822	âWhy, this is a palace!â she said to her husband, looking around
  5823	with the expression with which people compliment their host at a ball.
  5824	âLetâs come, quick, quick!â And with a glance round, she smiled at
  5825	TÃ­khon, at her husband, and at the footman who accompanied them.
  5826	
  5827	âIs that Mary practicing? Letâs go quietly and take her by
  5828	surprise.â
  5829	
  5830	Prince Andrew followed her with a courteous but sad expression.
  5831	
  5832	âYouâve grown older, TÃ­khon,â he said in passing to the old man,
  5833	who kissed his hand.
  5834	
  5835	Before they reached the room from which the sounds of the clavichord
  5836	came, the pretty, fair-haired Frenchwoman, Mademoiselle Bourienne,
  5837	rushed out apparently beside herself with delight.
  5838	
  5839	âAh! what joy for the princess!â exclaimed she: âAt last! I must
  5840	let her know.â
  5841	
  5842	âNo, no, please not... You are Mademoiselle Bourienne,â said
  5843	the little princess, kissing her. âI know you already through my
  5844	sister-in-lawâs friendship for you. She was not expecting us?â
  5845	
  5846	They went up to the door of the sitting room from which came the sound
  5847	of the oft-repeated passage of the sonata. Prince Andrew stopped and
  5848	made a grimace, as if expecting something unpleasant.
  5849	
  5850	The little princess entered the room. The passage broke off in the
  5851	middle, a cry was heard, then Princess Maryâs heavy tread and the
  5852	sound of kissing. When Prince Andrew went in the two princesses, who
  5853	had only met once before for a short time at his wedding, were in
  5854	each otherâs arms warmly pressing their lips to whatever place they
  5855	happened to touch. Mademoiselle Bourienne stood near them pressing her
  5856	hand to her heart, with a beatific smile and obviously equally ready to
  5857	cry or to laugh. Prince Andrew shrugged his shoulders and frowned, as
  5858	lovers of music do when they hear a false note. The two women let go
  5859	of one another, and then, as if afraid of being too late, seized each
  5860	otherâs hands, kissing them and pulling them away, and again began
  5861	kissing each other on the face, and then to Prince Andrewâs surprise
  5862	both began to cry and kissed again. Mademoiselle Bourienne also began to
  5863	cry. Prince Andrew evidently felt ill at ease, but to the two women
  5864	it seemed quite natural that they should cry, and apparently it never
  5865	entered their heads that it could have been otherwise at this meeting.
  5866	
  5867	âAh! my dear!... Ah! Mary!...â they suddenly exclaimed, and then
  5868	laughed. âI dreamed last night...âââYou were not expecting
  5869	us?...â âAh! Mary, you have got thinner?...â âAnd you have grown
  5870	stouter!...â
  5871	
  5872	âI knew the princess at once,â put in Mademoiselle Bourienne.
  5873	
  5874	âAnd I had no idea!...â exclaimed Princess Mary. âAh, Andrew, I
  5875	did not see you.â
  5876	
  5877	Prince Andrew and his sister, hand in hand, kissed one another, and
  5878	he told her she was still the same crybaby as ever. Princess Mary had
  5879	turned toward her brother, and through her tears the loving, warm,
  5880	gentle look of her large luminous eyes, very beautiful at that moment,
  5881	rested on Prince Andrewâs face.
  5882	
  5883	The little princess talked incessantly, her short, downy upper lip
  5884	continually and rapidly touching her rosy nether lip when necessary
  5885	and drawing up again next moment when her face broke into a smile of
  5886	glittering teeth and sparkling eyes. She told of an accident they had
  5887	had on the SpÃ¡sski Hill which might have been serious for her in her
  5888	condition, and immediately after that informed them that she had left
  5889	all her clothes in Petersburg and that heaven knew what she would have
  5890	to dress in here; and that Andrew had quite changed, and that Kitty
  5891	OdÃ½ntsova had married an old man, and that there was a suitor for Mary,
  5892	a real one, but that they would talk of that later. Princess Mary was
  5893	still looking silently at her brother and her beautiful eyes were full
  5894	of love and sadness. It was plain that she was following a train of
  5895	thought independent of her sister-in-lawâs words. In the midst of a
  5896	description of the last Petersburg fete she addressed her brother:
  5897	
  5898	âSo you are really going to the war, Andrew?â she said sighing.
  5899	
  5900	Lise sighed too.
  5901	
  5902	âYes, and even tomorrow,â replied her brother.
  5903	
  5904	âHe is leaving me here, God knows why, when he might have had
  5905	promotion...â
  5906	
  5907	Princess Mary did not listen to the end, but continuing her train of
  5908	thought turned to her sister-in-law with a tender glance at her figure.
  5909	
  5910	âIs it certain?â she said.
  5911	
  5912	The face of the little princess changed. She sighed and said: âYes,
  5913	quite certain. Ah! it is very dreadful...â
  5914	
  5915	Her lip descended. She brought her face close to her sister-in-lawâs
  5916	and unexpectedly again began to cry.
  5917	
  5918	âShe needs rest,â said Prince Andrew with a frown. âDonât you,
  5919	Lise? Take her to your room and Iâll go to Father. How is he? Just the
  5920	same?â
  5921	
  5922	âYes, just the same. Though I donât know what your opinion will
  5923	be,â answered the princess joyfully.
  5924	
  5925	âAnd are the hours the same? And the walks in the avenues? And the
  5926	lathe?â asked Prince Andrew with a scarcely perceptible smile which
  5927	showed that, in spite of all his love and respect for his father, he was
  5928	aware of his weaknesses.
  5929	
  5930	âThe hours are the same, and the lathe, and also the mathematics and
  5931	my geometry lessons,â said Princess Mary gleefully, as if her lessons
  5932	in geometry were among the greatest delights of her life.
  5933	
  5934	When the twenty minutes had elapsed and the time had come for the old
  5935	prince to get up, TÃ­khon came to call the young prince to his father.
  5936	The old man made a departure from his usual routine in honor of his
  5937	sonâs arrival: he gave orders to admit him to his apartments while
  5938	he dressed for dinner. The old prince always dressed in old-fashioned
  5939	style, wearing an antique coat and powdered hair; and when Prince Andrew
  5940	entered his fatherâs dressing room (not with the contemptuous look and
  5941	manner he wore in drawing rooms, but with the animated face with which
  5942	he talked to Pierre), the old man was sitting on a large leather-covered
  5943	chair, wrapped in a powdering mantle, entrusting his head to TÃ­khon.
  5944	
  5945	âAh! hereâs the warrior! Wants to vanquish Buonaparte?â said the
  5946	old man, shaking his powdered head as much as the tail, which TÃ­khon
  5947	was holding fast to plait, would allow.
  5948	
  5949	âYou at least must tackle him properly, or else if he goes on like
  5950	this heâll soon have us, too, for his subjects! How are you?â And he
  5951	held out his cheek.
  5952	
  5953	The old man was in a good temper after his nap before dinner. (He
  5954	used to say that a nap âafter dinner was silverâbefore dinner,
  5955	golden.â) He cast happy, sidelong glances at his son from under his
  5956	thick, bushy eyebrows. Prince Andrew went up and kissed his father on
  5957	the spot indicated to him. He made no reply on his fatherâs favorite
  5958	topicâmaking fun of the military men of the day, and more particularly
  5959	of Bonaparte.
  5960	
  5961	âYes, Father, I have come to you and brought my wife who is
  5962	pregnant,â said Prince Andrew, following every movement of his
  5963	fatherâs face with an eager and respectful look. âHow is your
  5964	health?â
  5965	
  5966	âOnly fools and rakes fall ill, my boy. You know me: I am busy from
  5967	morning till night and abstemious, so of course I am well.â
  5968	
  5969	âThank God,â said his son smiling.
  5970	
  5971	âGod has nothing to do with it! Well, go on,â he continued,
  5972	returning to his hobby; âtell me how the Germans have taught you to
  5973	fight Bonaparte by this new science you call âstrategy.ââ
  5974	
  5975	Prince Andrew smiled.
  5976	
  5977	âGive me time to collect my wits, Father,â said he, with a smile
  5978	that showed that his fatherâs foibles did not prevent his son from
  5979	loving and honoring him. âWhy, I have not yet had time to settle
  5980	down!â
  5981	
  5982	âNonsense, nonsense!â cried the old man, shaking his pigtail to
  5983	see whether it was firmly plaited, and grasping his by the hand. âThe
  5984	house for your wife is ready. Princess Mary will take her there and
  5985	show her over, and theyâll talk nineteen to the dozen. Thatâs
  5986	their womanâs way! I am glad to have her. Sit down and talk. About
  5987	Mikhelsonâs army I understandâTolstÃ³y âs too... a simultaneous
  5988	expedition.... But whatâs the southern army to do? Prussia is
  5989	neutral... I know that. What about Austria?â said he, rising from his
  5990	chair and pacing up and down the room followed by TÃ­khon, who ran after
  5991	him, handing him different articles of clothing. âWhat of Sweden? How
  5992	will they cross Pomerania?â
  5993	
  5994	Prince Andrew, seeing that his father insisted, beganâat first
  5995	reluctantly, but gradually with more and more animation, and from habit
  5996	changing unconsciously from Russian to French as he went onâto explain
  5997	the plan of operation for the coming campaign. He explained how an army,
  5998	ninety thousand strong, was to threaten Prussia so as to bring her out
  5999	of her neutrality and draw her into the war; how part of that army was
  6000	to join some Swedish forces at Stralsund; how two hundred and twenty
  6001	thousand Austrians, with a hundred thousand Russians, were to operate in
  6002	Italy and on the Rhine; how fifty thousand Russians and as many English
  6003	were to land at Naples, and how a total force of five hundred thousand
  6004	men was to attack the French from different sides. The old prince did
  6005	not evince the least interest during this explanation, but as if he were
  6006	not listening to it continued to dress while walking about, and three
  6007	times unexpectedly interrupted. Once he stopped it by shouting: âThe
  6008	white one, the white one!â
  6009	
  6010	This meant that TÃ­khon was not handing him the waistcoat he wanted.
  6011	Another time he interrupted, saying:
  6012	
  6013	âAnd will she soon be confined?â and shaking his head reproachfully
  6014	said: âThatâs bad! Go on, go on.â
  6015	
  6016	The third interruption came when Prince Andrew was finishing his
  6017	description. The old man began to sing, in the cracked voice of old age:
  6018	âMalbrook sâen va-t-en guerre. Dieu sait quand reviendra.â *
  6019	
  6020	     * âMarlborough is going to the wars; God knows when heâll
  6021	     return.â
  6022	
  6023	
  6024	His son only smiled.
  6025	
  6026	âI donât say itâs a plan I approve of,â said the son; âI am
  6027	only telling you what it is. Napoleon has also formed his plan by now,
  6028	not worse than this one.â
  6029	
  6030	âWell, youâve told me nothing new,â and the old man repeated,
  6031	meditatively and rapidly:
  6032	
  6033	âDieu sait quand reviendra. Go to the dining room.â
  6034	
  6035	
  6036	
  6037	
  6038	
  6039	CHAPTER XXVII
  6040	
  6041	At the appointed hour the prince, powdered and shaven, entered the
  6042	dining room where his daughter-in-law, Princess Mary, and Mademoiselle
  6043	Bourienne were already awaiting him together with his architect, who by
  6044	a strange caprice of his employerâs was admitted to table though the
  6045	position of that insignificant individual was such as could certainly
  6046	not have caused him to expect that honor. The prince, who generally kept
  6047	very strictly to social distinctions and rarely admitted even important
  6048	government officials to his table, had unexpectedly selected Michael
  6049	IvÃ¡novich (who always went into a corner to blow his nose on his
  6050	checked handkerchief) to illustrate the theory that all men are equals,
  6051	and had more than once impressed on his daughter that Michael IvÃ¡novich
  6052	was ânot a whit worse than you or I.â At dinner the prince usually
  6053	spoke to the taciturn Michael IvÃ¡novich more often than to anyone else.
  6054	
  6055	In the dining room, which like all the rooms in the house was
  6056	exceedingly lofty, the members of the household and the footmenâone
  6057	behind each chairâstood waiting for the prince to enter. The head
  6058	butler, napkin on arm, was scanning the setting of the table, making
  6059	signs to the footmen, and anxiously glancing from the clock to the door
  6060	by which the prince was to enter. Prince Andrew was looking at a large
  6061	gilt frame, new to him, containing the genealogical tree of the Princes
  6062	BolkÃ³nski, opposite which hung another such frame with a badly painted
  6063	portrait (evidently by the hand of the artist belonging to the estate)
  6064	of a ruling prince, in a crownâan alleged descendant of RÃºrik and
  6065	ancestor of the BolkÃ³nskis. Prince Andrew, looking again at that
  6066	genealogical tree, shook his head, laughing as a man laughs who looks at
  6067	a portrait so characteristic of the original as to be amusing.
  6068	
  6069	âHow thoroughly like him that is!â he said to Princess Mary, who had
  6070	come up to him.
  6071	
  6072	Princess Mary looked at her brother in surprise. She did not understand
  6073	what he was laughing at. Everything her father did inspired her with
  6074	reverence and was beyond question.
  6075	
  6076	âEveryone has his Achillesâ heel,â continued Prince Andrew.
  6077	âFancy, with his powerful mind, indulging in such nonsense!â
  6078	
  6079	Princess Mary could not understand the boldness of her brotherâs
  6080	criticism and was about to reply, when the expected footsteps were heard
  6081	coming from the study. The prince walked in quickly and jauntily as was
  6082	his wont, as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of his manners
  6083	with the strict formality of his house. At that moment the great clock
  6084	struck two and another with a shrill tone joined in from the drawing
  6085	room. The prince stood still; his lively glittering eyes from under
  6086	their thick, bushy eyebrows sternly scanned all present and rested on
  6087	the little princess. She felt, as courtiers do when the Tsar enters, the
  6088	sensation of fear and respect which the old man inspired in all around
  6089	him. He stroked her hair and then patted her awkwardly on the back of
  6090	her neck.
  6091	
  6092	âIâm glad, glad, to see you,â he said, looking attentively into
  6093	her eyes, and then quickly went to his place and sat down. âSit down,
  6094	sit down! Sit down, Michael IvÃ¡novich!â
  6095	
  6096	He indicated a place beside him to his daughter-in-law. A footman moved
  6097	the chair for her.
  6098	
  6099	âHo, ho!â said the old man, casting his eyes on her rounded figure.
  6100	âYouâve been in a hurry. Thatâs bad!â
  6101	
  6102	He laughed in his usual dry, cold, unpleasant way, with his lips only
  6103	and not with his eyes.
  6104	
  6105	âYou must walk, walk as much as possible, as much as possible,â he
  6106	said.
  6107	
  6108	The little princess did not, or did not wish to, hear his words. She was
  6109	silent and seemed confused. The prince asked her about her father, and
  6110	she began to smile and talk. He asked about mutual acquaintances, and
  6111	she became still more animated and chattered away giving him greetings
  6112	from various people and retelling the town gossip.
  6113	
  6114	âCountess AprÃ¡ksina, poor thing, has lost her husband and she has
  6115	cried her eyes out,â she said, growing more and more lively.
  6116	
  6117	As she became animated the prince looked at her more and more sternly,
  6118	and suddenly, as if he had studied her sufficiently and had formed a
  6119	definite idea of her, he turned away and addressed Michael IvÃ¡novich.
  6120	
  6121	âWell, Michael IvÃ¡novich, our Bonaparte will be having a bad time
  6122	of it. Prince Andrewâ (he always spoke thus of his son) âhas been
  6123	telling me what forces are being collected against him! While you and I
  6124	never thought much of him.â
  6125	
  6126	Michael IvÃ¡novich did not at all know when âyou and Iâ had said
  6127	such things about Bonaparte, but understanding that he was wanted as
  6128	a peg on which to hang the princeâs favorite topic, he looked
  6129	inquiringly at the young prince, wondering what would follow.
  6130	
  6131	âHe is a great tactician!â said the prince to his son, pointing to
  6132	the architect.
  6133	
  6134	And the conversation again turned on the war, on Bonaparte, and the
  6135	generals and statesmen of the day. The old prince seemed convinced not
  6136	only that all the men of the day were mere babies who did not know the
  6137	A B C of war or of politics, and that Bonaparte was an insignificant
  6138	little Frenchy, successful only because there were no longer any
  6139	PotÃ«mkins or SuvÃ³rovs left to oppose him; but he was also convinced
  6140	that there were no political difficulties in Europe and no real war,
  6141	but only a sort of puppet show at which the men of the day were playing,
  6142	pretending to do something real. Prince Andrew gaily bore with his
  6143	fatherâs ridicule of the new men, and drew him on and listened to him
  6144	with evident pleasure.
  6145	
  6146	âThe past always seems good,â said he, âbut did not SuvÃ³rov
  6147	himself fall into a trap Moreau set him, and from which he did not know
  6148	how to escape?â
  6149	
  6150	âWho told you that? Who?â cried the prince. âSuvÃ³rov!â And he
  6151	jerked away his plate, which TÃ­khon briskly caught. âSuvÃ³rov!...
  6152	Consider, Prince Andrew. Two... Frederick and SuvÃ³rov; Moreau!...
  6153	Moreau would have been a prisoner if SuvÃ³rov had had a free hand; but
  6154	he had the Hofs-kriegs-wurst-schnapps-Rath on his hands. It would have
  6155	puzzled the devil himself! When you get there youâll find out what
  6156	those Hofs-kriegs-wurst-Raths are! SuvÃ³rov couldnât manage them so
  6157	what chance has Michael KutÃºzov? No, my dear boy,â he continued,
  6158	âyou and your generals wonât get on against Buonaparte; youâll
  6159	have to call in the French, so that birds of a feather may fight
  6160	together. The German, Pahlen, has been sent to New York in America, to
  6161	fetch the Frenchman, Moreau,â he said, alluding to the invitation made
  6162	that year to Moreau to enter the Russian service.... âWonderful!...
  6163	Were the PotÃ«mkins, SuvÃ³rovs, and OrlÃ³vs Germans? No, lad, either you
  6164	fellows have all lost your wits, or I have outlived mine. May God help
  6165	you, but weâll see what will happen. Buonaparte has become a great
  6166	commander among them! Hm!...â
  6167	
  6168	âI donât at all say that all the plans are good,â said Prince
  6169	Andrew, âI am only surprised at your opinion of Bonaparte. You
  6170	may laugh as much as you like, but all the same Bonaparte is a great
  6171	general!â
  6172	
  6173	âMichael IvÃ¡novich!â cried the old prince to the architect who,
  6174	busy with his roast meat, hoped he had been forgotten: âDidnât
  6175	I tell you Buonaparte was a great tactician? Here, he says the same
  6176	thing.â
  6177	
  6178	âTo be sure, your excellency,â replied the architect.
  6179	
  6180	The prince again laughed his frigid laugh.
  6181	
  6182	âBuonaparte was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He has got
  6183	splendid soldiers. Besides he began by attacking Germans. And only
  6184	idlers have failed to beat the Germans. Since the world began everybody
  6185	has beaten the Germans. They beat no oneâexcept one another. He made
  6186	his reputation fighting them.â
  6187	
  6188	And the prince began explaining all the blunders which, according to
  6189	him, Bonaparte had made in his campaigns and even in politics. His
  6190	son made no rejoinder, but it was evident that whatever arguments were
  6191	presented he was as little able as his father to change his opinion. He
  6192	listened, refraining from a reply, and involuntarily wondered how this
  6193	old man, living alone in the country for so many years, could know and
  6194	discuss so minutely and acutely all the recent European military and
  6195	political events.
  6196	
  6197	âYou think Iâm an old man and donât understand the present state
  6198	of affairs?â concluded his father. âBut it troubles me. I donât
  6199	sleep at night. Come now, where has this great commander of yours shown
  6200	his skill?â he concluded.
  6201	
  6202	âThat would take too long to tell,â answered the son.
  6203	
  6204	âWell, then go off to your Buonaparte! Mademoiselle Bourienne,
  6205	hereâs another admirer of that powder-monkey emperor of yours,â he
  6206	exclaimed in excellent French.
  6207	
  6208	âYou know, Prince, I am not a Bonapartist!â
  6209	
  6210	âDieu sait quand reviendra.â hummed the prince out of tune and, with
  6211	a laugh still more so, he quitted the table.
  6212	
  6213	The little princess during the whole discussion and the rest of
  6214	the dinner sat silent, glancing with a frightened look now at her
  6215	father-in-law and now at Princess Mary. When they left the table she
  6216	took her sister-in-lawâs arm and drew her into another room.
  6217	
  6218	âWhat a clever man your father is,â said she; âperhaps that is why
  6219	I am afraid of him.â
  6220	
  6221	âOh, he is so kind!â answered Princess Mary.
  6222	
  6223	
  6224	
  6225	
  6226	
  6227	CHAPTER XXVIII
  6228	
  6229	Prince Andrew was to leave next evening. The old prince, not altering
  6230	his routine, retired as usual after dinner. The little princess was in
  6231	her sister-in-lawâs room. Prince Andrew in a traveling coat without
  6232	epaulettes had been packing with his valet in the rooms assigned to him.
  6233	After inspecting the carriage himself and seeing the trunks put in, he
  6234	ordered the horses to be harnessed. Only those things he always kept
  6235	with him remained in his room; a small box, a large canteen fitted
  6236	with silver plate, two Turkish pistols and a saberâa present from
  6237	his father who had brought it from the siege of OchÃ¡kov. All these
  6238	traveling effects of Prince Andrewâs were in very good order: new,
  6239	clean, and in cloth covers carefully tied with tapes.
  6240	
  6241	When starting on a journey or changing their mode of life, men capable
  6242	of reflection are generally in a serious frame of mind. At such moments
  6243	one reviews the past and plans for the future. Prince Andrewâs face
  6244	looked very thoughtful and tender. With his hands behind him he paced
  6245	briskly from corner to corner of the room, looking straight before him
  6246	and thoughtfully shaking his head. Did he fear going to the war, or was
  6247	he sad at leaving his wife?âperhaps both, but evidently he did not
  6248	wish to be seen in that mood, for hearing footsteps in the passage he
  6249	hurriedly unclasped his hands, stopped at a table as if tying the
  6250	cover of the small box, and assumed his usual tranquil and impenetrable
  6251	expression. It was the heavy tread of Princess Mary that he heard.
  6252	
  6253	âI hear you have given orders to harness,â she cried, panting (she
  6254	had apparently been running), âand I did so wish to have another talk
  6255	with you alone! God knows how long we may again be parted. You are not
  6256	angry with me for coming? You have changed so, AndrÃºsha,â she added,
  6257	as if to explain such a question.
  6258	
  6259	She smiled as she uttered his pet name, âAndrÃºsha.â It was
  6260	obviously strange to her to think that this stern handsome man should be
  6261	AndrÃºshaâthe slender mischievous boy who had been her playfellow in
  6262	childhood.
  6263	
  6264	âAnd where is Lise?â he asked, answering her question only by a
  6265	smile.
  6266	
  6267	âShe was so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa in my room.
  6268	Oh, Andrew! What a treasure of a wife you have,â said she, sitting
  6269	down on the sofa, facing her brother. âShe is quite a child: such a
  6270	dear, merry child. I have grown so fond of her.â
  6271	
  6272	Prince Andrew was silent, but the princess noticed the ironical and
  6273	contemptuous look that showed itself on his face.
  6274	
  6275	âOne must be indulgent to little weaknesses; who is free from them,
  6276	Andrew? Donât forget that she has grown up and been educated in
  6277	society, and so her position now is not a rosy one. We should enter into
  6278	everyoneâs situation. Tout comprendre, câest tout pardonner. * Think
  6279	what it must be for her, poor thing, after what she has been used to,
  6280	to be parted from her husband and be left alone in the country, in her
  6281	condition! Itâs very hard.â
  6282	
  6283	     * To understand all is to forgive all.
  6284	
  6285	Prince Andrew smiled as he looked at his sister, as we smile at those we
  6286	think we thoroughly understand.
  6287	
  6288	âYou live in the country and donât think the life terrible,â he
  6289	replied.
  6290	
  6291	âI... thatâs different. Why speak of me? I donât want any other
  6292	life, and canât, for I know no other. But think, Andrew: for a young
  6293	society woman to be buried in the country during the best years of her
  6294	life, all aloneâfor Papa is always busy, and I... well, you know what
  6295	poor resources I have for entertaining a woman used to the best society.
  6296	There is only Mademoiselle Bourienne....â
  6297	
  6298	âI donât like your Mademoiselle Bourienne at all,â said Prince
  6299	Andrew.
  6300	
  6301	âNo? She is very nice and kind and, above all, sheâs much to be
  6302	pitied. She has no one, no one. To tell the truth, I donât need her,
  6303	and sheâs even in my way. You know I always was a savage, and now am
  6304	even more so. I like being alone.... Father likes her very much. She and
  6305	Michael IvÃ¡novich are the two people to whom he is always gentle and
  6306	kind, because he has been a benefactor to them both. As Sterne says:
  6307	âWe donât love people so much for the good they have done us, as
  6308	for the good we have done them.â Father took her when she was homeless
  6309	after losing her own father. She is very good-natured, and my father
  6310	likes her way of reading. She reads to him in the evenings and reads
  6311	splendidly.â
  6312	
  6313	âTo be quite frank, Mary, I expect Fatherâs character sometimes
  6314	makes things trying for you, doesnât it?â Prince Andrew asked
  6315	suddenly.
  6316	
  6317	Princess Mary was first surprised and then aghast at this question.
  6318	
  6319	âFor me? For me?... Trying for me!...â said she.
  6320	
  6321	âHe always was rather harsh; and now I should think heâs getting
  6322	very trying,â said Prince Andrew, apparently speaking lightly of their
  6323	father in order to puzzle or test his sister.
  6324	
  6325	âYou are good in every way, Andrew, but you have a kind of
  6326	intellectual pride,â said the princess, following the train of her own
  6327	thoughts rather than the trend of the conversationââand thatâs a
  6328	great sin. How can one judge Father? But even if one might, what feeling
  6329	except veneration could such a man as my father evoke? And I am so
  6330	contented and happy with him. I only wish you were all as happy as I
  6331	am.â
  6332	
  6333	Her brother shook his head incredulously.
  6334	
  6335	âThe only thing that is hard for me... I will tell you the truth,
  6336	Andrew... is Fatherâs way of treating religious subjects. I donât
  6337	understand how a man of his immense intellect can fail to see what is
  6338	as clear as day, and can go so far astray. That is the only thing
  6339	that makes me unhappy. But even in this I can see lately a shade of
  6340	improvement. His satire has been less bitter of late, and there was a
  6341	monk he received and had a long talk with.â
  6342	
  6343	âAh! my dear, I am afraid you and your monk are wasting your
  6344	powder,â said Prince Andrew banteringly yet tenderly.
  6345	
  6346	âAh! mon ami, I only pray, and hope that God will hear me.
  6347	Andrew...â she said timidly after a momentâs silence, âI have a
  6348	great favor to ask of you.â
  6349	
  6350	âWhat is it, dear?â
  6351	
  6352	âNoâpromise that you will not refuse! It will give you no trouble
  6353	and is nothing unworthy of you, but it will comfort me. Promise,
  6354	AndrÃºsha!...â said she, putting her hand in her reticule but not yet
  6355	taking out what she was holding inside it, as if what she held were
  6356	the subject of her request and must not be shown before the request was
  6357	granted.
  6358	
  6359	She looked timidly at her brother.
  6360	
  6361	âEven if it were a great deal of trouble...â answered Prince Andrew,
  6362	as if guessing what it was about.
  6363	
  6364	âThink what you please! I know you are just like Father. Think as
  6365	you please, but do this for my sake! Please do! Fatherâs father, our
  6366	grandfather, wore it in all his wars.â (She still did not take out
  6367	what she was holding in her reticule.) âSo you promise?â
  6368	
  6369	âOf course. What is it?â
  6370	
  6371	âAndrew, I bless you with this icon and you must promise me you will
  6372	never take it off. Do you promise?â
  6373	
  6374	âIf it does not weigh a hundredweight and wonât break my neck...
  6375	To please you...â said Prince Andrew. But immediately, noticing
  6376	the pained expression his joke had brought to his sisterâs face, he
  6377	repented and added: âI am glad; really, dear, I am very glad.â
  6378	
  6379	âAgainst your will He will save and have mercy on you and bring you
  6380	to Himself, for in Him alone is truth and peace,â said she in a voice
  6381	trembling with emotion, solemnly holding up in both hands before her
  6382	brother a small, oval, antique, dark-faced icon of the Saviour in a gold
  6383	setting, on a finely wrought silver chain.
  6384	
  6385	She crossed herself, kissed the icon, and handed it to Andrew.
  6386	
  6387	âPlease, Andrew, for my sake!...â
  6388	
  6389	Rays of gentle light shone from her large, timid eyes. Those eyes lit
  6390	up the whole of her thin, sickly face and made it beautiful. Her brother
  6391	would have taken the icon, but she stopped him. Andrew understood,
  6392	crossed himself and kissed the icon. There was a look of tenderness, for
  6393	he was touched, but also a gleam of irony on his face.
  6394	
  6395	âThank you, my dear.â She kissed him on the forehead and sat down
  6396	again on the sofa. They were silent for a while.
  6397	
  6398	âAs I was saying to you, Andrew, be kind and generous as you always
  6399	used to be. Donât judge Lise harshly,â she began. âShe is so
  6400	sweet, so good-natured, and her position now is a very hard one.â
  6401	
  6402	âI do not think I have complained of my wife to you, MÃ¡sha, or blamed
  6403	her. Why do you say all this to me?â
  6404	
  6405	Red patches appeared on Princess Maryâs face and she was silent as if
  6406	she felt guilty.
  6407	
  6408	âI have said nothing to you, but you have already been talked to. And
  6409	I am sorry for that,â he went on.
  6410	
  6411	The patches grew deeper on her forehead, neck, and cheeks. She tried to
  6412	say something but could not. Her brother had guessed right: the little
  6413	princess had been crying after dinner and had spoken of her forebodings
  6414	about her confinement, and how she dreaded it, and had complained of her
  6415	fate, her father-in-law, and her husband. After crying she had fallen
  6416	asleep. Prince Andrew felt sorry for his sister.
  6417	
  6418	âKnow this, MÃ¡sha: I canât reproach, have not reproached, and never
  6419	shall reproach my wife with anything, and I cannot reproach myself
  6420	with anything in regard to her; and that always will be so in whatever
  6421	circumstances I may be placed. But if you want to know the truth... if
  6422	you want to know whether I am happy? No! Is she happy? No! But why this
  6423	is so I donât know...â
  6424	
  6425	As he said this he rose, went to his sister, and, stooping, kissed
  6426	her forehead. His fine eyes lit up with a thoughtful, kindly, and
  6427	unaccustomed brightness, but he was looking not at his sister but over
  6428	her head toward the darkness of the open doorway.
  6429	
  6430	âLet us go to her, I must say good-by. Orâgo and wake and Iâll
  6431	come in a moment. PetrÃºshka!â he called to his valet: âCome here,
  6432	take these away. Put this on the seat and this to the right.â
  6433	
  6434	Princess Mary rose and moved to the door, then stopped and said:
  6435	âAndrew, if you had faith you would have turned to God and asked Him
  6436	to give you the love you do not feel, and your prayer would have been
  6437	answered.â
  6438	
  6439	âWell, maybe!â said Prince Andrew. âGo, MÃ¡sha; Iâll come
  6440	immediately.â
  6441	
  6442	On the way to his sisterâs room, in the passage which connected one
  6443	wing with the other, Prince Andrew met Mademoiselle Bourienne smiling
  6444	sweetly. It was the third time that day that, with an ecstatic and
  6445	artless smile, she had met him in secluded passages.
  6446	
  6447	âOh! I thought you were in your room,â she said, for some reason
  6448	blushing and dropping her eyes.
  6449	
  6450	Prince Andrew looked sternly at her and an expression of anger suddenly
  6451	came over his face. He said nothing to her but looked at her forehead
  6452	and hair, without looking at her eyes, with such contempt that the
  6453	Frenchwoman blushed and went away without a word. When he reached his
  6454	sisterâs room his wife was already awake and her merry voice, hurrying
  6455	one word after another, came through the open door. She was speaking as
  6456	usual in French, and as if after long self-restraint she wished to make
  6457	up for lost time.
  6458	
  6459	âNo, but imagine the old Countess ZÃºbova, with false curls and her
  6460	mouth full of false teeth, as if she were trying to cheat old age....
  6461	Ha, ha, ha! Mary!â
  6462	
  6463	This very sentence about Countess ZÃºbova and this same laugh Prince
  6464	Andrew had already heard from his wife in the presence of others some
  6465	five times. He entered the room softly. The little princess, plump and
  6466	rosy, was sitting in an easy chair with her work in her hands, talking
  6467	incessantly, repeating Petersburg reminiscences and even phrases. Prince
  6468	Andrew came up, stroked her hair, and asked if she felt rested after
  6469	their journey. She answered him and continued her chatter.
  6470	
  6471	The coach with six horses was waiting at the porch. It was an autumn
  6472	night, so dark that the coachman could not see the carriage pole.
  6473	Servants with lanterns were bustling about in the porch. The immense
  6474	house was brilliant with lights shining through its lofty windows. The
  6475	domestic serfs were crowding in the hall, waiting to bid good-by to
  6476	the young prince. The members of the household were all gathered in the
  6477	reception hall: Michael IvÃ¡novich, Mademoiselle Bourienne, Princess
  6478	Mary, and the little princess. Prince Andrew had been called to his
  6479	fatherâs study as the latter wished to say good-by to him alone. All
  6480	were waiting for them to come out.
  6481	
  6482	When Prince Andrew entered the study the old man in his old-age
  6483	spectacles and white dressing gown, in which he received no one but his
  6484	son, sat at the table writing. He glanced round.
  6485	
  6486	âGoing?â And he went on writing.
  6487	
  6488	âIâve come to say good-by.â
  6489	
  6490	âKiss me here,â and he touched his cheek: âThanks, thanks!â
  6491	
  6492	âWhat do you thank me for?â
  6493	
  6494	âFor not dilly-dallying and not hanging to a womanâs apron strings.
  6495	The Service before everything. Thanks, thanks!â And he went on
  6496	writing, so that his quill spluttered and squeaked. âIf you have
  6497	anything to say, say it. These two things can be done together,â he
  6498	added.
  6499	
  6500	âAbout my wife... I am ashamed as it is to leave her on your
  6501	hands....â
  6502	
  6503	âWhy talk nonsense? Say what you want.â
  6504	
  6505	âWhen her confinement is due, send to Moscow for an accoucheur.... Let
  6506	him be here....â
  6507	
  6508	The old prince stopped writing and, as if not understanding, fixed his
  6509	stern eyes on his son.
  6510	
  6511	âI know that no one can help if nature does not do her work,â said
  6512	Prince Andrew, evidently confused. âI know that out of a million
  6513	cases only one goes wrong, but it is her fancy and mine. They have been
  6514	telling her things. She has had a dream and is frightened.â
  6515	
  6516	âHm... Hm...â muttered the old prince to himself, finishing what he
  6517	was writing. âIâll do it.â
  6518	
  6519	He signed with a flourish and suddenly turning to his son began to
  6520	laugh.
  6521	
  6522	âItâs a bad business, eh?â
  6523	
  6524	âWhat is bad, Father?â
  6525	
  6526	âThe wife!â said the old prince, briefly and significantly.
  6527	
  6528	âI donât understand!â said Prince Andrew.
  6529	
  6530	âNo, it canât be helped, lad,â said the prince. âTheyâre
  6531	all like that; one canât unmarry. Donât be afraid; I wonât tell
  6532	anyone, but you know it yourself.â
  6533	
  6534	He seized his son by the hand with small bony fingers, shook it, looked
  6535	straight into his sonâs face with keen eyes which seemed to see
  6536	through him, and again laughed his frigid laugh.
  6537	
  6538	The son sighed, thus admitting that his father had understood him. The
  6539	old man continued to fold and seal his letter, snatching up and throwing
  6540	down the wax, the seal, and the paper, with his accustomed rapidity.
  6541	
  6542	âWhatâs to be done? Sheâs pretty! I will do everything. Make your
  6543	mind easy,â said he in abrupt sentences while sealing his letter.
  6544	
  6545	Andrew did not speak; he was both pleased and displeased that his father
  6546	understood him. The old man got up and gave the letter to his son.
  6547	
  6548	âListen!â said he; âdonât worry about your wife: what can be
  6549	done shall be. Now listen! Give this letter to Michael IlariÃ³novich. *
  6550	I have written that he should make use of you in proper places and not
  6551	keep you long as an adjutant: a bad position! Tell him I remember
  6552	and like him. Write and tell me how he receives you. If he is all
  6553	rightâserve him. Nicholas BolkÃ³nskiâs son need not serve under
  6554	anyone if he is in disfavor. Now come here.â
  6555	
  6556	     *KutÃºzov.
  6557	
  6558	He spoke so rapidly that he did not finish half his words, but his son
  6559	was accustomed to understand him. He led him to the desk, raised the
  6560	lid, drew out a drawer, and took out an exercise book filled with his
  6561	bold, tall, close handwriting.
  6562	
  6563	âI shall probably die before you. So remember, these are my memoirs;
  6564	hand them to the Emperor after my death. Now here is a Lombard bond
  6565	and a letter; it is a premium for the man who writes a history of
  6566	SuvÃ³rovâs wars. Send it to the Academy. Here are some jottings for
  6567	you to read when I am gone. You will find them useful.â
  6568	
  6569	Andrew did not tell his father that he would no doubt live a long time
  6570	yet. He felt that he must not say it.
  6571	
  6572	âI will do it all, Father,â he said.
  6573	
  6574	âWell, now, good-by!â He gave his son his hand to kiss, and embraced
  6575	him. âRemember this, Prince Andrew, if they kill you it will hurt me,
  6576	your old father...â he paused unexpectedly, and then in a querulous
  6577	voice suddenly shrieked: âbut if I hear that you have not behaved like
  6578	a son of Nicholas BolkÃ³nski, I shall be ashamed!â
  6579	
  6580	âYou need not have said that to me, Father,â said the son with a
  6581	smile.
  6582	
  6583	The old man was silent.
  6584	
  6585	âI also wanted to ask you,â continued Prince Andrew, âif Iâm
  6586	killed and if I have a son, do not let him be taken away from youâas I
  6587	said yesterday... let him grow up with you.... Please.â
  6588	
  6589	âNot let the wife have him?â said the old man, and laughed.
  6590	
  6591	They stood silent, facing one another. The old manâs sharp eyes were
  6592	fixed straight on his sonâs. Something twitched in the lower part of
  6593	the old princeâs face.
  6594	
  6595	âWeâve said good-by. Go!â he suddenly shouted in a loud, angry
  6596	voice, opening his door.
  6597	
  6598	âWhat is it? What?â asked both princesses when they saw for a moment
  6599	at the door Prince Andrew and the figure of the old man in a white
  6600	dressing gown, spectacled and wigless, shouting in an angry voice.
  6601	
  6602	Prince Andrew sighed and made no reply.
  6603	
  6604	âWell!â he said, turning to his wife.
  6605	
  6606	And this âWell!â sounded coldly ironic, as if he were saying: âNow
  6607	go through your performance.â
  6608	
  6609	âAndrew, already!â said the little princess, turning pale and
  6610	looking with dismay at her husband.
  6611	
  6612	He embraced her. She screamed and fell unconscious on his shoulder.
  6613	
  6614	He cautiously released the shoulder she leaned on, looked into her face,
  6615	and carefully placed her in an easy chair.
  6616	
  6617	âAdieu, Mary,â said he gently to his sister, taking her by the hand
  6618	and kissing her, and then he left the room with rapid steps.
  6619	
  6620	The little princess lay in the armchair, Mademoiselle Bourienne chafing
  6621	her temples. Princess Mary, supporting her sister-in-law, still looked
  6622	with her beautiful eyes full of tears at the door through which Prince
  6623	Andrew had gone and made the sign of the cross in his direction. From
  6624	the study, like pistol shots, came the frequent sound of the old man
  6625	angrily blowing his nose. Hardly had Prince Andrew gone when the study
  6626	door opened quickly and the stern figure of the old man in the white
  6627	dressing gown looked out.
  6628	
  6629	âGone? Thatâs all right!â said he; and looking angrily at the
  6630	unconscious little princess, he shook his head reprovingly and slammed
  6631	the door.

  6643	CHAPTER I
  6644	
  6645	In October, 1805, a Russian army was occupying the villages and towns of
  6646	the Archduchy of Austria, and yet other regiments freshly arriving from
  6647	Russia were settling near the fortress of Braunau and burdening the
  6648	inhabitants on whom they were quartered. Braunau was the headquarters of
  6649	the commander in chief, KutÃºzov.
  6650	
  6651	On October 11, 1805, one of the infantry regiments that had just reached
  6652	Braunau had halted half a mile from the town, waiting to be inspected
  6653	by the commander in chief. Despite the un-Russian appearance of the
  6654	locality and surroundingsâfruit gardens, stone fences, tiled roofs,
  6655	and hills in the distanceâand despite the fact that the inhabitants
  6656	(who gazed with curiosity at the soldiers) were not Russians, the
  6657	regiment had just the appearance of any Russian regiment preparing for
  6658	an inspection anywhere in the heart of Russia.
  6659	
  6660	On the evening of the last dayâs march an order had been received that
  6661	the commander in chief would inspect the regiment on the march. Though
  6662	the words of the order were not clear to the regimental commander, and
  6663	the question arose whether the troops were to be in marching order or
  6664	not, it was decided at a consultation between the battalion commanders
  6665	to present the regiment in parade order, on the principle that it is
  6666	always better to âbow too low than not bow low enough.â So the
  6667	soldiers, after a twenty-mile march, were kept mending and cleaning all
  6668	night long without closing their eyes, while the adjutants and
  6669	company commanders calculated and reckoned, and by morning the
  6670	regimentâinstead of the straggling, disorderly crowd it had been on
  6671	its last march the day beforeâpresented a well-ordered array of two
  6672	thousand men each of whom knew his place and his duty, had every button
  6673	and every strap in place, and shone with cleanliness. And not only
  6674	externally was all in order, but had it pleased the commander in chief
  6675	to look under the uniforms he would have found on every man a clean
  6676	shirt, and in every knapsack the appointed number of articles, âawl,
  6677	soap, and all,â as the soldiers say. There was only one circumstance
  6678	concerning which no one could be at ease. It was the state of the
  6679	soldiersâ boots. More than half the menâs boots were in holes. But
  6680	this defect was not due to any fault of the regimental commander, for
  6681	in spite of repeated demands boots had not been issued by the Austrian
  6682	commissariat, and the regiment had marched some seven hundred miles.
  6683	
  6684	The commander of the regiment was an elderly, choleric, stout, and
  6685	thick-set general with grizzled eyebrows and whiskers, and wider from
  6686	chest to back than across the shoulders. He had on a brand-new uniform
  6687	showing the creases where it had been folded and thick gold epaulettes
  6688	which seemed to stand rather than lie down on his massive shoulders. He
  6689	had the air of a man happily performing one of the most solemn duties of
  6690	his life. He walked about in front of the line and at every step pulled
  6691	himself up, slightly arching his back. It was plain that the commander
  6692	admired his regiment, rejoiced in it, and that his whole mind was
  6693	engrossed by it, yet his strut seemed to indicate that, besides military
  6694	matters, social interests and the fair sex occupied no small part of his
  6695	thoughts.
  6696	
  6697	âWell, Michael MÃ­trich, sir?â he said, addressing one of the
  6698	battalion commanders who smilingly pressed forward (it was plain that
  6699	they both felt happy). âWe had our hands full last night. However, I
  6700	think the regiment is not a bad one, eh?â
  6701	
  6702	The battalion commander perceived the jovial irony and laughed.
  6703	
  6704	âIt would not be turned off the field even on the TsarÃ­tsin
  6705	Meadow.â
  6706	
  6707	âWhat?â asked the commander.
  6708	
  6709	At that moment, on the road from the town on which signalers had been
  6710	posted, two men appeared on horse back. They were an aide-de-camp
  6711	followed by a Cossack.
  6712	
  6713	The aide-de-camp was sent to confirm the order which had not been
  6714	clearly worded the day before, namely, that the commander in chief
  6715	wished to see the regiment just in the state in which it had been on
  6716	the march: in their greatcoats, and packs, and without any preparation
  6717	whatever.
  6718	
  6719	A member of the Hofkriegsrath from Vienna had come to KutÃºzov the day
  6720	before with proposals and demands for him to join up with the army of
  6721	the Archduke Ferdinand and Mack, and KutÃºzov, not considering this
  6722	junction advisable, meant, among other arguments in support of his view,
  6723	to show the Austrian general the wretched state in which the troops
  6724	arrived from Russia. With this object he intended to meet the regiment;
  6725	so the worse the condition it was in, the better pleased the commander
  6726	in chief would be. Though the aide-de-camp did not know these
  6727	circumstances, he nevertheless delivered the definite order that the
  6728	men should be in their greatcoats and in marching order, and that the
  6729	commander in chief would otherwise be dissatisfied. On hearing this the
  6730	regimental commander hung his head, silently shrugged his shoulders, and
  6731	spread out his arms with a choleric gesture.
  6732	
  6733	âA fine mess weâve made of it!â he remarked.
  6734	
  6735	âThere now! Didnât I tell you, Michael MÃ­trich, that if it was said
  6736	âon the marchâ it meant in greatcoats?â said he reproachfully to
  6737	the battalion commander. âOh, my God!â he added, stepping resolutely
  6738	forward. âCompany commanders!â he shouted in a voice accustomed to
  6739	command. âSergeants major!... How soon will he be here?â he asked
  6740	the aide-de-camp with a respectful politeness evidently relating to the
  6741	personage he was referring to.
  6742	
  6743	âIn an hourâs time, I should say.â
  6744	
  6745	âShall we have time to change clothes?â
  6746	
  6747	âI donât know, General....â
  6748	
  6749	The regimental commander, going up to the line himself, ordered the
  6750	soldiers to change into their greatcoats. The company commanders ran off
  6751	to their companies, the sergeants major began bustling (the greatcoats
  6752	were not in very good condition), and instantly the squares that had up
  6753	to then been in regular order and silent began to sway and stretch and
  6754	hum with voices. On all sides soldiers were running to and fro, throwing
  6755	up their knapsacks with a jerk of their shoulders and pulling the straps
  6756	over their heads, unstrapping their overcoats and drawing the sleeves on
  6757	with upraised arms.
  6758	
  6759	In half an hour all was again in order, only the squares had become gray
  6760	instead of black. The regimental commander walked with his jerky steps
  6761	to the front of the regiment and examined it from a distance.
  6762	
  6763	âWhatever is this? This!â he shouted and stood still. âCommander
  6764	of the third company!â
  6765	
  6766	âCommander of the third company wanted by the general!... commander to
  6767	the general... third company to the commander.â The words passed along
  6768	the lines and an adjutant ran to look for the missing officer.
  6769	
  6770	When the eager but misrepeated words had reached their destination in
  6771	a cry of: âThe general to the third company,â the missing officer
  6772	appeared from behind his company and, though he was a middle-aged man
  6773	and not in the habit of running, trotted awkwardly stumbling on his
  6774	toes toward the general. The captainâs face showed the uneasiness of
  6775	a schoolboy who is told to repeat a lesson he has not learned. Spots
  6776	appeared on his nose, the redness of which was evidently due to
  6777	intemperance, and his mouth twitched nervously. The general looked the
  6778	captain up and down as he came up panting, slackening his pace as he
  6779	approached.
  6780	
  6781	âYou will soon be dressing your men in petticoats! What is this?â
  6782	shouted the regimental commander, thrusting forward his jaw and pointing
  6783	at a soldier in the ranks of the third company in a greatcoat of bluish
  6784	cloth, which contrasted with the others. âWhat have you been after?
  6785	The commander in chief is expected and you leave your place? Eh? Iâll
  6786	teach you to dress the men in fancy coats for a parade.... Eh...?â
  6787	
  6788	The commander of the company, with his eyes fixed on his superior,
  6789	pressed two fingers more and more rigidly to his cap, as if in this
  6790	pressure lay his only hope of salvation.
  6791	
  6792	âWell, why donât you speak? Whom have you got there dressed up as a
  6793	Hungarian?â said the commander with an austere gibe.
  6794	
  6795	âYour excellency...â
  6796	
  6797	âWell, your excellency, what? Your excellency! But what about your
  6798	excellency?... nobody knows.â
  6799	
  6800	âYour excellency, itâs the officer DÃ³lokhov, who has been reduced
  6801	to the ranks,â said the captain softly.
  6802	
  6803	âWell? Has he been degraded into a field marshal, or into a soldier?
  6804	If a soldier, he should be dressed in regulation uniform like the
  6805	others.â
  6806	
  6807	âYour excellency, you gave him leave yourself, on the march.â
  6808	
  6809	âGave him leave? Leave? Thatâs just like you young men,â said the
  6810	regimental commander cooling down a little. âLeave indeed.... One says
  6811	a word to you and you... What?â he added with renewed irritation, âI
  6812	beg you to dress your men decently.â
  6813	
  6814	And the commander, turning to look at the adjutant, directed his jerky
  6815	steps down the line. He was evidently pleased at his own display of
  6816	anger and walking up to the regiment wished to find a further excuse for
  6817	wrath. Having snapped at an officer for an unpolished badge, at another
  6818	because his line was not straight, he reached the third company.
  6819	
  6820	âH-o-o-w are you standing? Whereâs your leg? Your leg?â shouted
  6821	the commander with a tone of suffering in his voice, while there were
  6822	still five men between him and DÃ³lokhov with his bluish-gray uniform.
  6823	
  6824	DÃ³lokhov slowly straightened his bent knee, looking straight with his
  6825	clear, insolent eyes in the generalâs face.
  6826	
  6827	âWhy a blue coat? Off with it... Sergeant major! Change his coat...
  6828	the ras...â he did not finish.
  6829	
  6830	âGeneral, I must obey orders, but I am not bound to endure...â
  6831	DÃ³lokhov hurriedly interrupted.
  6832	
  6833	âNo talking in the ranks!... No talking, no talking!â
  6834	
  6835	âNot bound to endure insults,â DÃ³lokhov concluded in loud, ringing
  6836	tones.
  6837	
  6838	The eyes of the general and the soldier met. The general became silent,
  6839	angrily pulling down his tight scarf.
  6840	
  6841	âI request you to have the goodness to change your coat,â he said as
  6842	he turned away.
  6843	
  6844	
  6845	
  6846	
  6847	
  6848	CHAPTER II
  6849	
  6850	âHeâs coming!â shouted the signaler at that moment.
  6851	
  6852	The regimental commander, flushing, ran to his horse, seized the stirrup
  6853	with trembling hands, threw his body across the saddle, righted himself,
  6854	drew his saber, and with a happy and resolute countenance, opening
  6855	his mouth awry, prepared to shout. The regiment fluttered like a bird
  6856	preening its plumage and became motionless.
  6857	
  6858	âAtt-ention!â shouted the regimental commander in a soul-shaking
  6859	voice which expressed joy for himself, severity for the regiment, and
  6860	welcome for the approaching chief.
  6861	
  6862	Along the broad country road, edged on both sides by trees, came a high,
  6863	light blue Viennese calÃ¨che, slightly creaking on its springs and drawn
  6864	by six horses at a smart trot. Behind the calÃ¨che galloped the suite
  6865	and a convoy of Croats. Beside KutÃºzov sat an Austrian general, in
  6866	a white uniform that looked strange among the Russian black ones. The
  6867	calÃ¨che stopped in front of the regiment. KutÃºzov and the Austrian
  6868	general were talking in low voices and KutÃºzov smiled slightly as
  6869	treading heavily he stepped down from the carriage just as if those two
  6870	thousand men breathlessly gazing at him and the regimental commander did
  6871	not exist.
  6872	
  6873	The word of command rang out, and again the regiment quivered, as with a
  6874	jingling sound it presented arms. Then amidst a dead silence the
  6875	feeble voice of the commander in chief was heard. The regiment roared,
  6876	âHealth to your ex... len... len... lency!â and again all became
  6877	silent. At first KutÃºzov stood still while the regiment moved; then he
  6878	and the general in white, accompanied by the suite, walked between the
  6879	ranks.
  6880	
  6881	From the way the regimental commander saluted the commander in chief and
  6882	devoured him with his eyes, drawing himself up obsequiously, and from
  6883	the way he walked through the ranks behind the generals, bending forward
  6884	and hardly able to restrain his jerky movements, and from the way he
  6885	darted forward at every word or gesture of the commander in chief,
  6886	it was evident that he performed his duty as a subordinate with even
  6887	greater zeal than his duty as a commander. Thanks to the strictness and
  6888	assiduity of its commander the regiment, in comparison with others that
  6889	had reached Braunau at the same time, was in splendid condition. There
  6890	were only 217 sick and stragglers. Everything was in good order except
  6891	the boots.
  6892	
  6893	KutÃºzov walked through the ranks, sometimes stopping to say a few
  6894	friendly words to officers he had known in the Turkish war, sometimes
  6895	also to the soldiers. Looking at their boots he several times shook his
  6896	head sadly, pointing them out to the Austrian general with an expression
  6897	which seemed to say that he was not blaming anyone, but could not help
  6898	noticing what a bad state of things it was. The regimental commander
  6899	ran forward on each such occasion, fearing to miss a single word of the
  6900	commander in chiefâs regarding the regiment. Behind KutÃºzov, at a
  6901	distance that allowed every softly spoken word to be heard, followed
  6902	some twenty men of his suite. These gentlemen talked among themselves
  6903	and sometimes laughed. Nearest of all to the commander in chief walked
  6904	a handsome adjutant. This was Prince BolkÃ³nski. Beside him was his
  6905	comrade NesvÃ­tski, a tall staff officer, extremely stout, with a
  6906	kindly, smiling, handsome face and moist eyes. NesvÃ­tski could hardly
  6907	keep from laughter provoked by a swarthy hussar officer who walked
  6908	beside him. This hussar, with a grave face and without a smile or a
  6909	change in the expression of his fixed eyes, watched the regimental
  6910	commanderâs back and mimicked his every movement. Each time the
  6911	commander started and bent forward, the hussar started and bent forward
  6912	in exactly the same manner. NesvÃ­tski laughed and nudged the others to
  6913	make them look at the wag.
  6914	
  6915	KutÃºzov walked slowly and languidly past thousands of eyes which were
  6916	starting from their sockets to watch their chief. On reaching the
  6917	third company he suddenly stopped. His suite, not having expected this,
  6918	involuntarily came closer to him.
  6919	
  6920	âAh, TimÃ³khin!â said he, recognizing the red-nosed captain who had
  6921	been reprimanded on account of the blue greatcoat.
  6922	
  6923	One would have thought it impossible for a man to stretch himself
  6924	more than TimÃ³khin had done when he was reprimanded by the regimental
  6925	commander, but now that the commander in chief addressed him he drew
  6926	himself up to such an extent that it seemed he could not have sustained
  6927	it had the commander in chief continued to look at him, and so KutÃºzov,
  6928	who evidently understood his case and wished him nothing but good,
  6929	quickly turned away, a scarcely perceptible smile flitting over his
  6930	scarred and puffy face.
  6931	
  6932	âAnother Ismail comrade,â said he. âA brave officer! Are you
  6933	satisfied with him?â he asked the regimental commander.
  6934	
  6935	And the latterâunconscious that he was being reflected in the hussar
  6936	officer as in a looking glassâstarted, moved forward, and answered:
  6937	âHighly satisfied, your excellency!â
  6938	
  6939	âWe all have our weaknesses,â said KutÃºzov smiling and walking away
  6940	from him. âHe used to have a predilection for Bacchus.â
  6941	
  6942	The regimental commander was afraid he might be blamed for this and did
  6943	not answer. The hussar at that moment noticed the face of the red-nosed
  6944	captain and his drawn-in stomach, and mimicked his expression and pose
  6945	with such exactitude that NesvÃ­tski could not help laughing. KutÃºzov
  6946	turned round. The officer evidently had complete control of his face,
  6947	and while KutÃºzov was turning managed to make a grimace and then assume
  6948	a most serious, deferential, and innocent expression.
  6949	
  6950	The third company was the last, and KutÃºzov pondered, apparently trying
  6951	to recollect something. Prince Andrew stepped forward from among the
  6952	suite and said in French:
  6953	
  6954	âYou told me to remind you of the officer DÃ³lokhov, reduced to the
  6955	ranks in this regiment.â
  6956	
  6957	âWhere is DÃ³lokhov?â asked KutÃºzov.
  6958	
  6959	DÃ³lokhov, who had already changed into a soldierâs gray greatcoat,
  6960	did not wait to be called. The shapely figure of the fair-haired
  6961	soldier, with his clear blue eyes, stepped forward from the ranks, went
  6962	up to the commander in chief, and presented arms.
  6963	
  6964	âHave you a complaint to make?â KutÃºzov asked with a slight frown.
  6965	
  6966	âThis is DÃ³lokhov,â said Prince Andrew.
  6967	
  6968	âAh!â said KutÃºzov. âI hope this will be a lesson to you. Do your
  6969	duty. The Emperor is gracious, and I shanât forget you if you deserve
  6970	well.â
  6971	
  6972	The clear blue eyes looked at the commander in chief just as boldly as
  6973	they had looked at the regimental commander, seeming by their expression
  6974	to tear open the veil of convention that separates a commander in chief
  6975	so widely from a private.
  6976	
  6977	âOne thing I ask of your excellency,â DÃ³lokhov said in his firm,
  6978	ringing, deliberate voice. âI ask an opportunity to atone for my fault
  6979	and prove my devotion to His Majesty the Emperor and to Russia!â
  6980	
  6981	KutÃºzov turned away. The same smile of the eyes with which he had
  6982	turned from Captain TimÃ³khin again flitted over his face. He turned
  6983	away with a grimace as if to say that everything DÃ³lokhov had said to
  6984	him and everything he could say had long been known to him, that he was
  6985	weary of it and it was not at all what he wanted. He turned away and
  6986	went to the carriage.
  6987	
  6988	The regiment broke up into companies, which went to their appointed
  6989	quarters near Braunau, where they hoped to receive boots and clothes and
  6990	to rest after their hard marches.
  6991	
  6992	âYou wonât bear me a grudge, ProkhÃ³r IgnÃ¡tych?â said the
  6993	regimental commander, overtaking the third company on its way to its
  6994	quarters and riding up to Captain TimÃ³khin who was walking in front.
  6995	(The regimental commanderâs face now that the inspection was happily
  6996	over beamed with irrepressible delight.) âItâs in the Emperorâs
  6997	service... it canât be helped... one is sometimes a bit hasty on
  6998	parade... I am the first to apologize, you know me!... He was very
  6999	pleased!â And he held out his hand to the captain.
  7000	
  7001	âDonât mention it, General, as if Iâd be so bold!â replied the
  7002	captain, his nose growing redder as he gave a smile which showed where
  7003	two front teeth were missing that had been knocked out by the butt end
  7004	of a gun at Ismail.
  7005	
  7006	âAnd tell Mr. DÃ³lokhov that I wonât forget himâhe may be quite
  7007	easy. And tell me, pleaseâIâve been meaning to askâhow is he
  7008	behaving himself, and in general...â
  7009	
  7010	âAs far as the service goes he is quite punctilious, your excellency;
  7011	but his character...â said TimÃ³khin.
  7012	
  7013	âAnd what about his character?â asked the regimental commander.
  7014	
  7015	âItâs different on different days,â answered the captain. âOne
  7016	day he is sensible, well educated, and good-natured, and the next heâs
  7017	a wild beast.... In Poland, if you please, he nearly killed a Jew.â
  7018	
  7019	âOh, well, well!â remarked the regimental commander. âStill, one
  7020	must have pity on a young man in misfortune. You know he has important
  7021	connections... Well, then, you just...â
  7022	
  7023	âI will, your excellency,â said TimÃ³khin, showing by his smile that
  7024	he understood his commanderâs wish.
  7025	
  7026	âWell, of course, of course!â
  7027	
  7028	The regimental commander sought out DÃ³lokhov in the ranks and, reining
  7029	in his horse, said to him:
  7030	
  7031	âAfter the next affair... epaulettes.â
  7032	
  7033	DÃ³lokhov looked round but did not say anything, nor did the mocking
  7034	smile on his lips change.
  7035	
  7036	âWell, thatâs all right,â continued the regimental commander. âA
  7037	cup of vodka for the men from me,â he added so that the soldiers
  7038	could hear. âI thank you all! God be praised!â and he rode past that
  7039	company and overtook the next one.
  7040	
  7041	âWell, heâs really a good fellow, one can serve under him,â said
  7042	TimÃ³khin to the subaltern beside him.
  7043	
  7044	âIn a word, a hearty one...â said the subaltern, laughing (the
  7045	regimental commander was nicknamed King of Hearts).
  7046	
  7047	The cheerful mood of their officers after the inspection infected the
  7048	soldiers. The company marched on gaily. The soldiersâ voices could be
  7049	heard on every side.
  7050	
  7051	âAnd they said KutÃºzov was blind of one eye?â
  7052	
  7053	âAnd so he is! Quite blind!â
  7054	
  7055	âNo, friend, he is sharper-eyed than you are. Boots and leg bands...
  7056	he noticed everything...â
  7057	
  7058	âWhen he looked at my feet, friend... well, thinks I...â
  7059	
  7060	âAnd that other one with him, the Austrian, looked as if he were
  7061	smeared with chalkâas white as flour! I suppose they polish him up as
  7062	they do the guns.â
  7063	
  7064	âI say, FÃ©deshon!... Did he say when the battles are to begin? You
  7065	were near him. Everybody said that Buonaparte himself was at Braunau.â
  7066	
  7067	âBuonaparte himself!... Just listen to the fool, what he doesnât
  7068	know! The Prussians are up in arms now. The Austrians, you see, are
  7069	putting them down. When theyâve been put down, the war with Buonaparte
  7070	will begin. And he says Buonaparte is in Braunau! Shows youâre a fool.
  7071	Youâd better listen more carefully!â
  7072	
  7073	âWhat devils these quartermasters are! See, the fifth company is
  7074	turning into the village already... they will have their buckwheat
  7075	cooked before we reach our quarters.â
  7076	
  7077	âGive me a biscuit, you devil!â
  7078	
  7079	âAnd did you give me tobacco yesterday? Thatâs just it, friend! Ah,
  7080	well, never mind, here you are.â
  7081	
  7082	âThey might call a halt here or weâll have to do another four miles
  7083	without eating.â
  7084	
  7085	âWasnât it fine when those Germans gave us lifts! You just sit still
  7086	and are drawn along.â
  7087	
  7088	âAnd here, friend, the people are quite beggarly. There they all
  7089	seemed to be Polesâall under the Russian crownâbut here theyâre
  7090	all regular Germans.â
  7091	
  7092	âSingers to the frontâ came the captainâs order.
  7093	
  7094	And from the different ranks some twenty men ran to the front. A
  7095	drummer, their leader, turned round facing the singers, and flourishing
  7096	his arm, began a long-drawn-out soldiersâ song, commencing with the
  7097	words: âMorning dawned, the sun was rising,â and concluding: âOn
  7098	then, brothers, on to glory, led by Father KÃ¡menski.â This song had
  7099	been composed in the Turkish campaign and now being sung in Austria, the
  7100	only change being that the words âFather KÃ¡menskiâ were replaced by
  7101	âFather KutÃºzov.â
  7102	
  7103	Having jerked out these last words as soldiers do and waved his arms
  7104	as if flinging something to the ground, the drummerâa lean, handsome
  7105	soldier of fortyâlooked sternly at the singers and screwed up his
  7106	eyes. Then having satisfied himself that all eyes were fixed on him,
  7107	he raised both arms as if carefully lifting some invisible but precious
  7108	object above his head and, holding it there for some seconds, suddenly
  7109	flung it down and began:
  7110	
  7111	âOh, my bower, oh, my bower...!â
  7112	
  7113	âOh, my bower new...!â chimed in twenty voices, and the castanet
  7114	player, in spite of the burden of his equipment, rushed out to the front
  7115	and, walking backwards before the company, jerked his shoulders and
  7116	flourished his castanets as if threatening someone. The soldiers,
  7117	swinging their arms and keeping time spontaneously, marched with long
  7118	steps. Behind the company the sound of wheels, the creaking of springs,
  7119	and the tramp of horsesâ hoofs were heard. KutÃºzov and his suite were
  7120	returning to the town. The commander in chief made a sign that the
  7121	men should continue to march at ease, and he and all his suite showed
  7122	pleasure at the sound of the singing and the sight of the dancing
  7123	soldier and the gay and smartly marching men. In the second file
  7124	from the right flank, beside which the carriage passed the company,
  7125	a blue-eyed soldier involuntarily attracted notice. It was DÃ³lokhov
  7126	marching with particular grace and boldness in time to the song and
  7127	looking at those driving past as if he pitied all who were not at that
  7128	moment marching with the company. The hussar cornet of KutÃºzovâs
  7129	suite who had mimicked the regimental commander, fell back from the
  7130	carriage and rode up to DÃ³lokhov.
  7131	
  7132	Hussar cornet ZherkÃ³v had at one time, in Petersburg, belonged to
  7133	the wild set led by DÃ³lokhov. ZherkÃ³v had met DÃ³lokhov abroad as a
  7134	private and had not seen fit to recognize him. But now that KutÃºzov had
  7135	spoken to the gentleman ranker, he addressed him with the cordiality of
  7136	an old friend.
  7137	
  7138	âMy dear fellow, how are you?â said he through the singing, making
  7139	his horse keep pace with the company.
  7140	
  7141	âHow am I?â DÃ³lokhov answered coldly. âI am as you see.â
  7142	
  7143	The lively song gave a special flavor to the tone of free and easy
  7144	gaiety with which ZherkÃ³v spoke, and to the intentional coldness of
  7145	DÃ³lokhovâs reply.
  7146	
  7147	âAnd how do you get on with the officers?â inquired ZherkÃ³v.
  7148	
  7149	âAll right. They are good fellows. And how have you wriggled onto the
  7150	staff?â
  7151	
  7152	âI was attached; Iâm on duty.â
  7153	
  7154	Both were silent.
  7155	
  7156	âShe let the hawk fly upward from her wide right sleeve,â went the
  7157	song, arousing an involuntary sensation of courage and cheerfulness.
  7158	Their conversation would probably have been different but for the effect
  7159	of that song.
  7160	
  7161	âIs it true that Austrians have been beaten?â asked DÃ³lokhov.
  7162	
  7163	âThe devil only knows! They say so.â
  7164	
  7165	âIâm glad,â answered DÃ³lokhov briefly and clearly, as the song
  7166	demanded.
  7167	
  7168	âI say, come round some evening and weâll have a game of faro!â
  7169	said ZherkÃ³v.
  7170	
  7171	âWhy, have you too much money?â
  7172	
  7173	âDo come.â
  7174	
  7175	âI canât. Iâve sworn not to. I wonât drink and wonât play till
  7176	I get reinstated.â
  7177	
  7178	âWell, thatâs only till the first engagement.â
  7179	
  7180	âWe shall see.â
  7181	
  7182	They were again silent.
  7183	
  7184	âCome if you need anything. One can at least be of use on the
  7185	staff...â
  7186	
  7187	DÃ³lokhov smiled. âDonât trouble. If I want anything, I wonât
  7188	begâIâll take it!â
  7189	
  7190	âWell, never mind; I only...â
  7191	
  7192	âAnd I only...â
  7193	
  7194	âGood-by.â
  7195	
  7196	âGood health...â
  7197	
  7198	        âItâs a long, long way.
  7199	        To my native land...â
  7200	
  7201	
  7202	ZherkÃ³v touched his horse with the spurs; it pranced excitedly from
  7203	foot to foot uncertain with which to start, then settled down, galloped
  7204	past the company, and overtook the carriage, still keeping time to the
  7205	song.
  7206	
  7207	
  7208	
  7209	
  7210	
  7211	CHAPTER III
  7212	
  7213	On returning from the review, KutÃºzov took the Austrian general into
  7214	his private room and, calling his adjutant, asked for some papers
  7215	relating to the condition of the troops on their arrival, and the
  7216	letters that had come from the Archduke Ferdinand, who was in command of
  7217	the advanced army. Prince Andrew BolkÃ³nski came into the room with the
  7218	required papers. KutÃºzov and the Austrian member of the Hofkriegsrath
  7219	were sitting at the table on which a plan was spread out.
  7220	
  7221	âAh!...â said KutÃºzov glancing at BolkÃ³nski as if by this
  7222	exclamation he was asking the adjutant to wait, and he went on with the
  7223	conversation in French.
  7224	
  7225	âAll I can say, General,â said he with a pleasant elegance
  7226	of expression and intonation that obliged one to listen to each
  7227	deliberately spoken word. It was evident that KutÃºzov himself listened
  7228	with pleasure to his own voice. âAll I can say, General, is that if
  7229	the matter depended on my personal wishes, the will of His Majesty the
  7230	Emperor Francis would have been fulfilled long ago. I should long
  7231	ago have joined the archduke. And believe me on my honour that to me
  7232	personally it would be a pleasure to hand over the supreme command
  7233	of the army into the hands of a better informed and more skillful
  7234	generalâof whom Austria has so manyâand to lay down all this heavy
  7235	responsibility. But circumstances are sometimes too strong for us,
  7236	General.â
  7237	
  7238	And KutÃºzov smiled in a way that seemed to say, âYou are quite at
  7239	liberty not to believe me and I donât even care whether you do or
  7240	not, but you have no grounds for telling me so. And that is the whole
  7241	point.â
  7242	
  7243	The Austrian general looked dissatisfied, but had no option but to reply
  7244	in the same tone.
  7245	
  7246	âOn the contrary,â he said, in a querulous and angry tone that
  7247	contrasted with his flattering words, âon the contrary, your
  7248	excellencyâs participation in the common action is highly valued by
  7249	His Majesty; but we think the present delay is depriving the splendid
  7250	Russian troops and their commander of the laurels they have been
  7251	accustomed to win in their battles,â he concluded his evidently
  7252	prearranged sentence.
  7253	
  7254	KutÃºzov bowed with the same smile.
  7255	
  7256	âBut that is my conviction, and judging by the last letter with which
  7257	His Highness the Archduke Ferdinand has honored me, I imagine that the
  7258	Austrian troops, under the direction of so skillful a leader as General
  7259	Mack, have by now already gained a decisive victory and no longer need
  7260	our aid,â said KutÃºzov.
  7261	
  7262	The general frowned. Though there was no definite news of an Austrian
  7263	defeat, there were many circumstances confirming the unfavorable rumors
  7264	that were afloat, and so KutÃºzovâs suggestion of an Austrian victory
  7265	sounded much like irony. But KutÃºzov went on blandly smiling with the
  7266	same expression, which seemed to say that he had a right to suppose
  7267	so. And, in fact, the last letter he had received from Mackâs army
  7268	informed him of a victory and stated strategically the position of the
  7269	army was very favorable.
  7270	
  7271	âGive me that letter,â said KutÃºzov turning to Prince Andrew.
  7272	âPlease have a look at itââand KutÃºzov with an ironical smile
  7273	about the corners of his mouth read to the Austrian general the
  7274	following passage, in German, from the Archduke Ferdinandâs letter:
  7275	
  7276	We have fully concentrated forces of nearly seventy thousand men with
  7277	which to attack and defeat the enemy should he cross the Lech. Also,
  7278	as we are masters of Ulm, we cannot be deprived of the advantage of
  7279	commanding both sides of the Danube, so that should the enemy not
  7280	cross the Lech, we can cross the Danube, throw ourselves on his line
  7281	of communications, recross the river lower down, and frustrate his
  7282	intention should he try to direct his whole force against our faithful
  7283	ally. We shall therefore confidently await the moment when the Imperial
  7284	Russian army will be fully equipped, and shall then, in conjunction with
  7285	it, easily find a way to prepare for the enemy the fate he deserves.
  7286	
  7287	KutÃºzov sighed deeply on finishing this paragraph and looked at the
  7288	member of the Hofkriegsrath mildly and attentively.
  7289	
  7290	âBut you know the wise maxim your excellency, advising one to expect
  7291	the worst,â said the Austrian general, evidently wishing to have done
  7292	with jests and to come to business. He involuntarily looked round at the
  7293	aide-de-camp.
  7294	
  7295	âExcuse me, General,â interrupted KutÃºzov, also turning to Prince
  7296	Andrew. âLook here, my dear fellow, get from KozlÃ³vski all the
  7297	reports from our scouts. Here are two letters from Count Nostitz and
  7298	here is one from His Highness the Archduke Ferdinand and here are
  7299	these,â he said, handing him several papers, âmake a neat memorandum
  7300	in French out of all this, showing all the news we have had of the
  7301	movements of the Austrian army, and then give it to his excellency.â
  7302	
  7303	Prince Andrew bowed his head in token of having understood from the
  7304	first not only what had been said but also what KutÃºzov would have
  7305	liked to tell him. He gathered up the papers and with a bow to both,
  7306	stepped softly over the carpet and went out into the waiting room.
  7307	
  7308	Though not much time had passed since Prince Andrew had left Russia, he
  7309	had changed greatly during that period. In the expression of his face,
  7310	in his movements, in his walk, scarcely a trace was left of his former
  7311	affected languor and indolence. He now looked like a man who has time
  7312	to think of the impression he makes on others, but is occupied with
  7313	agreeable and interesting work. His face expressed more satisfaction
  7314	with himself and those around him, his smile and glance were brighter
  7315	and more attractive.
  7316	
  7317	KutÃºzov, whom he had overtaken in Poland, had received him very kindly,
  7318	promised not to forget him, distinguished him above the other adjutants,
  7319	and had taken him to Vienna and given him the more serious commissions.
  7320	From Vienna KutÃºzov wrote to his old comrade, Prince Andrewâs father.
  7321	
  7322	Your son bids fair to become an officer distinguished by his industry,
  7323	firmness, and expedition. I consider myself fortunate to have such a
  7324	subordinate by me.
  7325	
  7326	On KutÃºzovâs staff, among his fellow officers and in the army
  7327	generally, Prince Andrew had, as he had had in Petersburg society, two
  7328	quite opposite reputations. Some, a minority, acknowledged him to be
  7329	different from themselves and from everyone else, expected great things
  7330	of him, listened to him, admired, and imitated him, and with them Prince
  7331	Andrew was natural and pleasant. Others, the majority, disliked him and
  7332	considered him conceited, cold, and disagreeable. But among these people
  7333	Prince Andrew knew how to take his stand so that they respected and even
  7334	feared him.
  7335	
  7336	Coming out of KutÃºzovâs room into the waiting room with the papers in
  7337	his hand Prince Andrew came up to his comrade, the aide-de-camp on duty,
  7338	KozlÃ³vski, who was sitting at the window with a book.
  7339	
  7340	âWell, Prince?â asked KozlÃ³vski.
  7341	
  7342	âI am ordered to write a memorandum explaining why we are not
  7343	advancing.â
  7344	
  7345	âAnd why is it?â
  7346	
  7347	Prince Andrew shrugged his shoulders.
  7348	
  7349	âAny news from Mack?â
  7350	
  7351	âNo.â
  7352	
  7353	âIf it were true that he has been beaten, news would have come.â
  7354	
  7355	âProbably,â said Prince Andrew moving toward the outer door.
  7356	
  7357	But at that instant a tall Austrian general in a greatcoat, with the
  7358	order of Maria Theresa on his neck and a black bandage round his head,
  7359	who had evidently just arrived, entered quickly, slamming the door.
  7360	Prince Andrew stopped short.
  7361	
  7362	âCommander in Chief KutÃºzov?â said the newly arrived general
  7363	speaking quickly with a harsh German accent, looking to both sides and
  7364	advancing straight toward the inner door.
  7365	
  7366	âThe commander in chief is engaged,â said KozlÃ³vski, going
  7367	hurriedly up to the unknown general and blocking his way to the door.
  7368	âWhom shall I announce?â
  7369	
  7370	The unknown general looked disdainfully down at KozlÃ³vski, who was
  7371	rather short, as if surprised that anyone should not know him.
  7372	
  7373	âThe commander in chief is engaged,â repeated KozlÃ³vski calmly.
  7374	
  7375	The generalâs face clouded, his lips quivered and trembled. He took
  7376	out a notebook, hurriedly scribbled something in pencil, tore out the
  7377	leaf, gave it to KozlÃ³vski, stepped quickly to the window, and threw
  7378	himself into a chair, gazing at those in the room as if asking, âWhy
  7379	do they look at me?â Then he lifted his head, stretched his neck as
  7380	if he intended to say something, but immediately, with affected
  7381	indifference, began to hum to himself, producing a queer sound which
  7382	immediately broke off. The door of the private room opened and KutÃºzov
  7383	appeared in the doorway. The general with the bandaged head bent forward
  7384	as though running away from some danger, and, making long, quick strides
  7385	with his thin legs, went up to KutÃºzov.
  7386	
  7387	âVous voyez le malheureux Mack,â he uttered in a broken voice.
  7388	
  7389	KutÃºzovâs face as he stood in the open doorway remained perfectly
  7390	immobile for a few moments. Then wrinkles ran over his face like a wave
  7391	and his forehead became smooth again, he bowed his head respectfully,
  7392	closed his eyes, silently let Mack enter his room before him, and closed
  7393	the door himself behind him.
  7394	
  7395	The report which had been circulated that the Austrians had been beaten
  7396	and that the whole army had surrendered at Ulm proved to be correct.
  7397	Within half an hour adjutants had been sent in various directions with
  7398	orders which showed that the Russian troops, who had hitherto been
  7399	inactive, would also soon have to meet the enemy.
  7400	
  7401	Prince Andrew was one of those rare staff officers whose chief interest
  7402	lay in the general progress of the war. When he saw Mack and heard the
  7403	details of his disaster he understood that half the campaign was lost,
  7404	understood all the difficulties of the Russian armyâs position, and
  7405	vividly imagined what awaited it and the part he would have to
  7406	play. Involuntarily he felt a joyful agitation at the thought of the
  7407	humiliation of arrogant Austria and that in a weekâs time he might,
  7408	perhaps, see and take part in the first Russian encounter with the
  7409	French since SuvÃ³rov met them. He feared that Bonaparteâs genius
  7410	might outweigh all the courage of the Russian troops, and at the same
  7411	time could not admit the idea of his hero being disgraced.
  7412	
  7413	Excited and irritated by these thoughts Prince Andrew went toward his
  7414	room to write to his father, to whom he wrote every day. In the corridor
  7415	he met NesvÃ­tski, with whom he shared a room, and the wag ZherkÃ³v;
  7416	they were as usual laughing.
  7417	
  7418	âWhy are you so glum?â asked NesvÃ­tski noticing Prince Andrewâs
  7419	pale face and glittering eyes.
  7420	
  7421	âThereâs nothing to be gay about,â answered BolkÃ³nski.
  7422	
  7423	Just as Prince Andrew met NesvÃ­tski and ZherkÃ³v, there came toward
  7424	them from the other end of the corridor, Strauch, an Austrian general
  7425	who on KutÃºzovâs staff in charge of the provisioning of the Russian
  7426	army, and the member of the Hofkriegsrath who had arrived the previous
  7427	evening. There was room enough in the wide corridor for the generals to
  7428	pass the three officers quite easily, but ZherkÃ³v, pushing NesvÃ­tski
  7429	aside with his arm, said in a breathless voice,
  7430	
  7431	âTheyâre coming!... theyâre coming!... Stand aside, make way,
  7432	please make way!â
  7433	
  7434	The generals were passing by, looking as if they wished to avoid
  7435	embarrassing attentions. On the face of the wag ZherkÃ³v there suddenly
  7436	appeared a stupid smile of glee which he seemed unable to suppress.
  7437	
  7438	âYour excellency,â said he in German, stepping forward and
  7439	addressing the Austrian general, âI have the honor to congratulate
  7440	you.â
  7441	
  7442	He bowed his head and scraped first with one foot and then with the
  7443	other, awkwardly, like a child at a dancing lesson.
  7444	
  7445	The member of the Hofkriegsrath looked at him severely but, seeing the
  7446	seriousness of his stupid smile, could not but give him a momentâs
  7447	attention. He screwed up his eyes showing that he was listening.
  7448	
  7449	âI have the honor to congratulate you. General Mack has arrived, quite
  7450	well, only a little bruised just here,â he added, pointing with a
  7451	beaming smile to his head.
  7452	
  7453	The general frowned, turned away, and went on.
  7454	
  7455	âGott, wie naiv!â * said he angrily, after he had gone a few steps.
  7456	
  7457	     * âGood God, what simplicity!â
  7458	
  7459	
  7460	NesvÃ­tski with a laugh threw his arms round Prince Andrew, but
  7461	BolkÃ³nski, turning still paler, pushed him away with an angry look and
  7462	turned to ZherkÃ³v. The nervous irritation aroused by the appearance
  7463	of Mack, the news of his defeat, and the thought of what lay before the
  7464	Russian army found vent in anger at ZherkÃ³vâs untimely jest.
  7465	
  7466	âIf you, sir, choose to make a buffoon of yourself,â he said
  7467	sharply, with a slight trembling of the lower jaw, âI canât prevent
  7468	your doing so; but I warn you that if you dare to play the fool in my
  7469	presence, I will teach you to behave yourself.â
  7470	
  7471	NesvÃ­tski and ZherkÃ³v were so surprised by this outburst that they
  7472	gazed at BolkÃ³nski silently with wide-open eyes.
  7473	
  7474	âWhatâs the matter? I only congratulated them,â said ZherkÃ³v.
  7475	
  7476	âI am not jesting with you; please be silent!â cried BolkÃ³nski,
  7477	and taking NesvÃ­tskiâs arm he left ZherkÃ³v, who did not know what to
  7478	say.
  7479	
  7480	âCome, whatâs the matter, old fellow?â said NesvÃ­tski trying to
  7481	soothe him.
  7482	
  7483	âWhatâs the matter?â exclaimed Prince Andrew standing still in
  7484	his excitement. âDonât you understand that either we are officers
  7485	serving our Tsar and our country, rejoicing in the successes and
  7486	grieving at the misfortunes of our common cause, or we are merely
  7487	lackeys who care nothing for their masterâs business. Quarante mille
  7488	hommes massacrÃ©s et lâarmÃ©e de nos alliÃ©s dÃ©truite, et vous
  7489	trouvez lÃ  le mot pour rire,â * he said, as if strengthening his
  7490	views by this French sentence. âCâest bien pour un garÃ§on de rien
  7491	comme cet individu dont vous avez fait un ami, mais pas pour vous, pas
  7492	pour vous. *(2) Only a hobbledehoy could amuse himself in this
  7493	way,â he added in Russianâbut pronouncing the word with a French
  7494	accentâhaving noticed that ZherkÃ³v could still hear him.
  7495	
  7496	     * âForty thousand men massacred and the army of our allies
  7497	     destroyed, and you find that a cause for jesting!â
  7498	
  7499	     * (2) âIt is all very well for that good-for-nothing fellow
  7500	     of whom you have made a friend, but not for you, not for
  7501	     you.â
  7502	
  7503	
  7504	He waited a moment to see whether the cornet would answer, but he turned
  7505	and went out of the corridor.
  7506	
  7507	
  7508	
  7509	
  7510	
  7511	CHAPTER IV
  7512	
  7513	The PÃ¡vlograd Hussars were stationed two miles from Braunau. The
  7514	squadron in which Nicholas RostÃ³v served as a cadet was quartered in
  7515	the German village of Salzeneck. The best quarters in the village were
  7516	assigned to cavalry-captain DenÃ­sov, the squadron commander, known
  7517	throughout the whole cavalry division as VÃ¡ska DenÃ­sov. Cadet RostÃ³v,
  7518	ever since he had overtaken the regiment in Poland, had lived with the
  7519	squadron commander.
  7520	
  7521	On October 11, the day when all was astir at headquarters over the news
  7522	of Mackâs defeat, the camp life of the officers of this squadron was
  7523	proceeding as usual. DenÃ­sov, who had been losing at cards all night,
  7524	had not yet come home when RostÃ³v rode back early in the morning from
  7525	a foraging expedition. RostÃ³v in his cadet uniform, with a jerk to his
  7526	horse, rode up to the porch, swung his leg over the saddle with a supple
  7527	youthful movement, stood for a moment in the stirrup as if loathe to
  7528	part from his horse, and at last sprang down and called to his orderly.
  7529	
  7530	âAh, BondarÃ©nko, dear friend!â said he to the hussar who rushed up
  7531	headlong to the horse. âWalk him up and down, my dear fellow,â he
  7532	continued, with that gay brotherly cordiality which goodhearted young
  7533	people show to everyone when they are happy.
  7534	
  7535	âYes, your excellency,â answered the Ukrainian gaily, tossing his
  7536	head.
  7537	
  7538	âMind, walk him up and down well!â
  7539	
  7540	Another hussar also rushed toward the horse, but BondarÃ©nko had already
  7541	thrown the reins of the snaffle bridle over the horseâs head. It was
  7542	evident that the cadet was liberal with his tips and that it paid to
  7543	serve him. RostÃ³v patted the horseâs neck and then his flank, and
  7544	lingered for a moment.
  7545	
  7546	âSplendid! What a horse he will be!â he thought with a smile, and
  7547	holding up his saber, his spurs jingling, he ran up the steps of the
  7548	porch. His landlord, who in a waistcoat and a pointed cap, pitchfork in
  7549	hand, was clearing manure from the cowhouse, looked out, and his face
  7550	immediately brightened on seeing RostÃ³v. âSchÃ¶n gut Morgen! SchÃ¶n
  7551	gut Morgen!â * he said winking with a merry smile, evidently pleased
  7552	to greet the young man.
  7553	
  7554	    * âA very good morning! A very good morning!â
  7555	
  7556	
  7557	âSchon fleissig?â * said RostÃ³v with the same gay brotherly smile
  7558	which did not leave his eager face. âHoch Oestreicher! Hoch Russen!
  7559	Kaiser Alexander hoch!â *(2) said he, quoting words often repeated by
  7560	the German landlord.
  7561	
  7562	    * âBusy already?â
  7563	
  7564	    * (2) âHurrah for the Austrians! Hurrah for the Russians!
  7565	     Hurrah for Emperor Alexander!â
  7566	
  7567	
  7568	The German laughed, came out of the cowshed, pulled off his cap, and
  7569	waving it above his head cried:
  7570	
  7571	âUnd die ganze Welt hoch!â *
  7572	
  7573	    * âAnd hurrah for the whole world!â
  7574	
  7575	
  7576	RostÃ³v waved his cap above his head like the German and cried laughing,
  7577	âUnd vivat die ganze Welt!â Though neither the German cleaning his
  7578	cowshed nor RostÃ³v back with his platoon from foraging for hay had any
  7579	reason for rejoicing, they looked at each other with joyful delight and
  7580	brotherly love, wagged their heads in token of their mutual affection,
  7581	and parted smiling, the German returning to his cowshed and RostÃ³v
  7582	going to the cottage he occupied with DenÃ­sov.
  7583	
  7584	âWhat about your master?â he asked LavrÃºshka, DenÃ­sovâs orderly,
  7585	whom all the regiment knew for a rogue.
  7586	
  7587	âHasnât been in since the evening. Must have been losing,â
  7588	answered LavrÃºshka. âI know by now, if he wins he comes back early to
  7589	brag about it, but if he stays out till morning it means heâs lost and
  7590	will come back in a rage. Will you have coffee?â
  7591	
  7592	âYes, bring some.â
  7593	
  7594	Ten minutes later LavrÃºshka brought the coffee. âHeâs coming!â
  7595	said he. âNow for trouble!â RostÃ³v looked out of the window and
  7596	saw DenÃ­sov coming home. DenÃ­sov was a small man with a red face,
  7597	sparkling black eyes, and black tousled mustache and hair. He wore an
  7598	unfastened cloak, wide breeches hanging down in creases, and a crumpled
  7599	shako on the back of his head. He came up to the porch gloomily, hanging
  7600	his head.
  7601	
  7602	âLavwÃºska!â he shouted loudly and angrily, âtake it off,
  7603	blockhead!â
  7604	
  7605	âWell, I am taking it off,â replied LavrÃºshkaâs voice.
  7606	
  7607	âAh, youâre up already,â said DenÃ­sov, entering the room.
  7608	
  7609	âLong ago,â answered RostÃ³v, âI have already been for the hay,
  7610	and have seen FrÃ¤ulein Mathilde.â
  7611	
  7612	âWeally! And Iâve been losing, bwother. I lost yesterday like a
  7613	damned fool!â cried DenÃ­sov, not pronouncing his râs. âSuch ill
  7614	luck! Such ill luck. As soon as you left, it began and went on. Hullo
  7615	there! Tea!â
  7616	
  7617	Puckering up his face though smiling, and showing his short strong
  7618	teeth, he began with stubby fingers of both hands to ruffle up his thick
  7619	tangled black hair.
  7620	
  7621	âAnd what devil made me go to that wat?â (an officer nicknamed
  7622	âthe ratâ) he said, rubbing his forehead and whole face with both
  7623	hands. âJust fancy, he didnât let me win a single cahd, not one
  7624	cahd.â
  7625	
  7626	He took the lighted pipe that was offered to him, gripped it in his
  7627	fist, and tapped it on the floor, making the sparks fly, while he
  7628	continued to shout.
  7629	
  7630	âHe lets one win the singles and collahs it as soon as one doubles it;
  7631	gives the singles and snatches the doubles!â
  7632	
  7633	He scattered the burning tobacco, smashed the pipe, and threw it away.
  7634	Then he remained silent for a while, and all at once looked cheerfully
  7635	with his glittering, black eyes at RostÃ³v.
  7636	
  7637	âIf at least we had some women here; but thereâs nothing foh one
  7638	to do but dwink. If we could only get to fighting soon. Hullo, whoâs
  7639	there?â he said, turning to the door as he heard a tread of heavy
  7640	boots and the clinking of spurs that came to a stop, and a respectful
  7641	cough.
  7642	
  7643	âThe squadron quartermaster!â said LavrÃºshka.
  7644	
  7645	DenÃ­sovâs face puckered still more.
  7646	
  7647	âWetched!â he muttered, throwing down a purse with some gold in it.
  7648	âWostÃ³v, deah fellow, just see how much there is left and shove the
  7649	purse undah the pillow,â he said, and went out to the quartermaster.
  7650	
  7651	RostÃ³v took the money and, mechanically arranging the old and new coins
  7652	in separate piles, began counting them.
  7653	
  7654	âAh! TelyÃ¡nin! How dâye do? They plucked me last night,â came
  7655	DenÃ­sovâs voice from the next room.
  7656	
  7657	âWhere? At Bykovâs, at the ratâs... I knew it,â replied a piping
  7658	voice, and Lieutenant TelyÃ¡nin, a small officer of the same squadron,
  7659	entered the room.
  7660	
  7661	RostÃ³v thrust the purse under the pillow and shook the damp little hand
  7662	which was offered him. TelyÃ¡nin for some reason had been transferred
  7663	from the Guards just before this campaign. He behaved very well in the
  7664	regiment but was not liked; RostÃ³v especially detested him and was
  7665	unable to overcome or conceal his groundless antipathy to the man.
  7666	
  7667	âWell, young cavalryman, how is my Rook behaving?â he asked. (Rook
  7668	was a young horse TelyÃ¡nin had sold to RostÃ³v.)
  7669	
  7670	The lieutenant never looked the man he was speaking to straight in the
  7671	face; his eyes continually wandered from one object to another.
  7672	
  7673	âI saw you riding this morning...â he added.
  7674	
  7675	âOh, heâs all right, a good horse,â answered RostÃ³v, though the
  7676	horse for which he had paid seven hundred rubbles was not worth half
  7677	that sum. âHeâs begun to go a little lame on the left foreleg,â he
  7678	added.
  7679	
  7680	âThe hoofâs cracked! Thatâs nothing. Iâll teach you what to do
  7681	and show you what kind of rivet to use.â
  7682	
  7683	âYes, please do,â said RostÃ³v.
  7684	
  7685	âIâll show you, Iâll show you! Itâs not a secret. And itâs a
  7686	horse youâll thank me for.â
  7687	
  7688	âThen Iâll have it brought round,â said RostÃ³v wishing to avoid
  7689	TelyÃ¡nin, and he went out to give the order.
  7690	
  7691	In the passage DenÃ­sov, with a pipe, was squatting on the threshold
  7692	facing the quartermaster who was reporting to him. On seeing RostÃ³v,
  7693	DenÃ­sov screwed up his face and pointing over his shoulder with his
  7694	thumb to the room where TelyÃ¡nin was sitting, he frowned and gave a
  7695	shudder of disgust.
  7696	
  7697	âUgh! I donât like that fellow,â he said, regardless of the
  7698	quartermasterâs presence.
  7699	
  7700	RostÃ³v shrugged his shoulders as much as to say: âNor do I, but
  7701	whatâs one to do?â and, having given his order, he returned to
  7702	TelyÃ¡nin.
  7703	
  7704	TelyÃ¡nin was sitting in the same indolent pose in which RostÃ³v had
  7705	left him, rubbing his small white hands.
  7706	
  7707	âWell there certainly are disgusting people,â thought RostÃ³v as he
  7708	entered.
  7709	
  7710	âHave you told them to bring the horse?â asked TelyÃ¡nin, getting up
  7711	and looking carelessly about him.
  7712	
  7713	âI have.â
  7714	
  7715	âLet us go ourselves. I only came round to ask DenÃ­sov about
  7716	yesterdayâs order. Have you got it, DenÃ­sov?â
  7717	
  7718	âNot yet. But where are you off to?â
  7719	
  7720	âI want to teach this young man how to shoe a horse,â said
  7721	TelyÃ¡nin.
  7722	
  7723	They went through the porch and into the stable. The lieutenant
  7724	explained how to rivet the hoof and went away to his own quarters.
  7725	
  7726	When RostÃ³v went back there was a bottle of vodka and a sausage on the
  7727	table. DenÃ­sov was sitting there scratching with his pen on a sheet of
  7728	paper. He looked gloomily in RostÃ³vâs face and said: âI am witing
  7729	to her.â
  7730	
  7731	He leaned his elbows on the table with his pen in his hand and,
  7732	evidently glad of a chance to say quicker in words what he wanted to
  7733	write, told RostÃ³v the contents of his letter.
  7734	
  7735	âYou see, my fwiend,â he said, âwe sleep when we donât love. We
  7736	are childwen of the dust... but one falls in love and one is a God, one
  7737	is puaâ as on the fihst day of cweation... Whoâs that now? Send him
  7738	to the devil, Iâm busy!â he shouted to LavrÃºshka, who went up to
  7739	him not in the least abashed.
  7740	
  7741	âWho should it be? You yourself told him to come. Itâs the
  7742	quartermaster for the money.â
  7743	
  7744	DenÃ­sov frowned and was about to shout some reply but stopped.
  7745	
  7746	âWetched business,â he muttered to himself. âHow much is left in
  7747	the puhse?â he asked, turning to RostÃ³v.
  7748	
  7749	âSeven new and three old imperials.â
  7750	
  7751	âOh, itâs wetched! Well, what are you standing there for, you
  7752	scaâcwow? Call the quahtehmasteh,â he shouted to LavrÃºshka.
  7753	
  7754	âPlease, DenÃ­sov, let me lend you some: I have some, you know,â
  7755	said RostÃ³v, blushing.
  7756	
  7757	âDonât like bowwowing from my own fellows, I donât,â growled
  7758	DenÃ­sov.
  7759	
  7760	âBut if you wonât accept money from me like a comrade, you will
  7761	offend me. Really I have some,â RostÃ³v repeated.
  7762	
  7763	âNo, I tell you.â
  7764	
  7765	And DenÃ­sov went to the bed to get the purse from under the pillow.
  7766	
  7767	âWhere have you put it, WostÃ³v?â
  7768	
  7769	âUnder the lower pillow.â
  7770	
  7771	âItâs not there.â
  7772	
  7773	DenÃ­sov threw both pillows on the floor. The purse was not there.
  7774	
  7775	âThatâs a miwacle.â
  7776	
  7777	âWait, havenât you dropped it?â said RostÃ³v, picking up the
  7778	pillows one at a time and shaking them.
  7779	
  7780	He pulled off the quilt and shook it. The purse was not there.
  7781	
  7782	âDear me, can I have forgotten? No, I remember thinking that you kept
  7783	it under your head like a treasure,â said RostÃ³v. âI put it just
  7784	here. Where is it?â he asked, turning to LavrÃºshka.
  7785	
  7786	âI havenât been in the room. It must be where you put it.â
  7787	
  7788	âBut it isnât?...â
  7789	
  7790	âYouâre always like that; you thwow a thing down anywhere and forget
  7791	it. Feel in your pockets.â
  7792	
  7793	âNo, if I hadnât thought of it being a treasure,â said RostÃ³v,
  7794	âbut I remember putting it there.â
  7795	
  7796	LavrÃºshka turned all the bedding over, looked under the bed and under
  7797	the table, searched everywhere, and stood still in the middle of the
  7798	room. DenÃ­sov silently watched LavrÃºshkaâs movements, and when the
  7799	latter threw up his arms in surprise saying it was nowhere to be found
  7800	DenÃ­sov glanced at RostÃ³v.
  7801	
  7802	âWostÃ³v, youâve not been playing schoolboy twicks...â
  7803	
  7804	RostÃ³v felt DenÃ­sovâs gaze fixed on him, raised his eyes, and
  7805	instantly dropped them again. All the blood which had seemed congested
  7806	somewhere below his throat rushed to his face and eyes. He could not
  7807	draw breath.
  7808	
  7809	âAnd there hasnât been anyone in the room except the lieutenant and
  7810	yourselves. It must be here somewhere,â said LavrÃºshka.
  7811	
  7812	âNow then, you devilâs puppet, look alive and hunt for it!â
  7813	shouted DenÃ­sov, suddenly, turning purple and rushing at the man with
  7814	a threatening gesture. âIf the purse isnât found Iâll flog you,
  7815	Iâll flog you all.â
  7816	
  7817	RostÃ³v, his eyes avoiding DenÃ­sov, began buttoning his coat, buckled
  7818	on his saber, and put on his cap.
  7819	
  7820	âI must have that purse, I tell you,â shouted DenÃ­sov, shaking his
  7821	orderly by the shoulders and knocking him against the wall.
  7822	
  7823	âDenÃ­sov, let him alone, I know who has taken it,â said RostÃ³v,
  7824	going toward the door without raising his eyes. DenÃ­sov paused, thought
  7825	a moment, and, evidently understanding what RostÃ³v hinted at, seized
  7826	his arm.
  7827	
  7828	âNonsense!â he cried, and the veins on his forehead and neck stood
  7829	out like cords. âYou are mad, I tell you. I wonât allow it.
  7830	The purse is here! Iâll flay this scoundwel alive, and it will be
  7831	found.â
  7832	
  7833	âI know who has taken it,â repeated RostÃ³v in an unsteady voice,
  7834	and went to the door.
  7835	
  7836	âAnd I tell you, donât you dahe to do it!â shouted DenÃ­sov,
  7837	rushing at the cadet to restrain him.
  7838	
  7839	But RostÃ³v pulled away his arm and, with as much anger as though
  7840	DenÃ­sov were his worst enemy, firmly fixed his eyes directly on his
  7841	face.
  7842	
  7843	âDo you understand what youâre saying?â he said in a trembling
  7844	voice. âThere was no one else in the room except myself. So that if it
  7845	is not so, then...â
  7846	
  7847	He could not finish, and ran out of the room.
  7848	
  7849	âAh, may the devil take you and evewybody,â were the last words
  7850	RostÃ³v heard.
  7851	
  7852	RostÃ³v went to TelyÃ¡ninâs quarters.
  7853	
  7854	âThe master is not in, heâs gone to headquarters,â said
  7855	TelyÃ¡ninâs orderly. âHas something happened?â he added, surprised
  7856	at the cadetâs troubled face.
  7857	
  7858	âNo, nothing.â
  7859	
  7860	âYouâve only just missed him,â said the orderly.
  7861	
  7862	The headquarters were situated two miles away from Salzeneck, and
  7863	RostÃ³v, without returning home, took a horse and rode there. There was
  7864	an inn in the village which the officers frequented. RostÃ³v rode up to
  7865	it and saw TelyÃ¡ninâs horse at the porch.
  7866	
  7867	In the second room of the inn the lieutenant was sitting over a dish of
  7868	sausages and a bottle of wine.
  7869	
  7870	âAh, youâve come here too, young man!â he said, smiling and
  7871	raising his eyebrows.
  7872	
  7873	âYes,â said RostÃ³v as if it cost him a great deal to utter the
  7874	word; and he sat down at the nearest table.
  7875	
  7876	Both were silent. There were two Germans and a Russian officer in the
  7877	room. No one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter of knives
  7878	and the munching of the lieutenant.
  7879	
  7880	When TelyÃ¡nin had finished his lunch he took out of his pocket a double
  7881	purse and, drawing its rings aside with his small, white, turned-up
  7882	fingers, drew out a gold imperial, and lifting his eyebrows gave it to
  7883	the waiter.
  7884	
  7885	âPlease be quick,â he said.
  7886	
  7887	The coin was a new one. RostÃ³v rose and went up to TelyÃ¡nin.
  7888	
  7889	âAllow me to look at your purse,â he said in a low, almost
  7890	inaudible, voice.
  7891	
  7892	With shifting eyes but eyebrows still raised, TelyÃ¡nin handed him the
  7893	purse.
  7894	
  7895	âYes, itâs a nice purse. Yes, yes,â he said, growing suddenly
  7896	pale, and added, âLook at it, young man.â
  7897	
  7898	RostÃ³v took the purse in his hand, examined it and the money in it, and
  7899	looked at TelyÃ¡nin. The lieutenant was looking about in his usual way
  7900	and suddenly seemed to grow very merry.
  7901	
  7902	âIf we get to Vienna Iâll get rid of it there but in these wretched
  7903	little towns thereâs nowhere to spend it,â said he. âWell, let me
  7904	have it, young man, Iâm going.â
  7905	
  7906	RostÃ³v did not speak.
  7907	
  7908	âAnd you? Are you going to have lunch too? They feed you quite
  7909	decently here,â continued TelyÃ¡nin. âNow then, let me have it.â
  7910	
  7911	He stretched out his hand to take hold of the purse. RostÃ³v let go of
  7912	it. TelyÃ¡nin took the purse and began carelessly slipping it into the
  7913	pocket of his riding breeches, with his eyebrows lifted and his mouth
  7914	slightly open, as if to say, âYes, yes, I am putting my purse in my
  7915	pocket and thatâs quite simple and is no one elseâs business.â
  7916	
  7917	âWell, young man?â he said with a sigh, and from under his lifted
  7918	brows he glanced into RostÃ³vâs eyes.
  7919	
  7920	Some flash as of an electric spark shot from TelyÃ¡ninâs eyes to
  7921	RostÃ³vâs and back, and back again and again in an instant.
  7922	
  7923	âCome here,â said RostÃ³v, catching hold of TelyÃ¡ninâs arm and
  7924	almost dragging him to the window. âThat money is DenÃ­sovâs; you
  7925	took it...â he whispered just above TelyÃ¡ninâs ear.
  7926	
  7927	âWhat? What? How dare you? What?â said TelyÃ¡nin.
  7928	
  7929	But these words came like a piteous, despairing cry and an entreaty for
  7930	pardon. As soon as RostÃ³v heard them, an enormous load of doubt
  7931	fell from him. He was glad, and at the same instant began to pity the
  7932	miserable man who stood before him, but the task he had begun had to be
  7933	completed.
  7934	
  7935	âHeaven only knows what the people here may imagine,â muttered
  7936	TelyÃ¡nin, taking up his cap and moving toward a small empty room. âWe
  7937	must have an explanation...â
  7938	
  7939	âI know it and shall prove it,â said RostÃ³v.
  7940	
  7941	âI...â
  7942	
  7943	Every muscle of TelyÃ¡ninâs pale, terrified face began to quiver, his
  7944	eyes still shifted from side to side but with a downward look not rising
  7945	to RostÃ³vâs face, and his sobs were audible.
  7946	
  7947	âCount!... Donât ruin a young fellow... here is this wretched money,
  7948	take it...â He threw it on the table. âI have an old father and
  7949	mother!...â
  7950	
  7951	RostÃ³v took the money, avoiding TelyÃ¡ninâs eyes, and went out of the
  7952	room without a word. But at the door he stopped and then retraced his
  7953	steps. âO God,â he said with tears in his eyes, âhow could you do
  7954	it?â
  7955	
  7956	âCount...â said TelyÃ¡nin drawing nearer to him.
  7957	
  7958	âDonât touch me,â said RostÃ³v, drawing back. âIf you need it,
  7959	take the money,â and he threw the purse to him and ran out of the inn.
  7960	
  7961	
  7962	
  7963	
  7964	
  7965	CHAPTER V
  7966	
  7967	That same evening there was an animated discussion among the
  7968	squadronâs officers in DenÃ­sovâs quarters.
  7969	
  7970	âAnd I tell you, RostÃ³v, that you must apologize to the colonel!â
  7971	said a tall, grizzly-haired staff captain, with enormous mustaches and
  7972	many wrinkles on his large features, to RostÃ³v who was crimson with
  7973	excitement.
  7974	
  7975	The staff captain, KÃ­rsten, had twice been reduced to the ranks for
  7976	affairs of honor and had twice regained his commission.
  7977	
  7978	âI will allow no one to call me a liar!â cried RostÃ³v. âHe told
  7979	me I lied, and I told him he lied. And there it rests. He may keep me
  7980	on duty every day, or may place me under arrest, but no one can make
  7981	me apologize, because if he, as commander of this regiment, thinks it
  7982	beneath his dignity to give me satisfaction, then...â
  7983	
  7984	âYou just wait a moment, my dear fellow, and listen,â interrupted
  7985	the staff captain in his deep bass, calmly stroking his long mustache.
  7986	âYou tell the colonel in the presence of other officers that an
  7987	officer has stolen...â
  7988	
  7989	âIâm not to blame that the conversation began in the presence of
  7990	other officers. Perhaps I ought not to have spoken before them, but I am
  7991	not a diplomatist. Thatâs why I joined the hussars, thinking that here
  7992	one would not need finesse; and he tells me that I am lyingâso let him
  7993	give me satisfaction...â
  7994	
  7995	âThatâs all right. No one thinks you a coward, but thatâs not the
  7996	point. Ask DenÃ­sov whether it is not out of the question for a cadet to
  7997	demand satisfaction of his regimental commander?â
  7998	
  7999	DenÃ­sov sat gloomily biting his mustache and listening to the
  8000	conversation, evidently with no wish to take part in it. He answered the
  8001	staff captainâs question by a disapproving shake of his head.
  8002	
  8003	âYou speak to the colonel about this nasty business before other
  8004	officers,â continued the staff captain, âand BogdÃ¡nichâ (the
  8005	colonel was called BogdÃ¡nich) âshuts you up.â
  8006	
  8007	âHe did not shut me up, he said I was telling an untruth.â
  8008	
  8009	âWell, have it so, and you talked a lot of nonsense to him and must
  8010	apologize.â
  8011	
  8012	âNot on any account!â exclaimed RostÃ³v.
  8013	
  8014	âI did not expect this of you,â said the staff captain seriously and
  8015	severely. âYou donât wish to apologize, but, man, itâs not only to
  8016	him but to the whole regimentâall of usâyouâre to blame all round.
  8017	The case is this: you ought to have thought the matter over and
  8018	taken advice; but no, you go and blurt it all straight out before the
  8019	officers. Now what was the colonel to do? Have the officer tried and
  8020	disgrace the whole regiment? Disgrace the whole regiment because of one
  8021	scoundrel? Is that how you look at it? We donât see it like that. And
  8022	BogdÃ¡nich was a brick: he told you you were saying what was not true.
  8023	Itâs not pleasant, but whatâs to be done, my dear fellow? You landed
  8024	yourself in it. And now, when one wants to smooth the thing over, some
  8025	conceit prevents your apologizing, and you wish to make the whole
  8026	affair public. You are offended at being put on duty a bit, but why not
  8027	apologize to an old and honorable officer? Whatever BogdÃ¡nich may
  8028	be, anyway he is an honorable and brave old colonel! Youâre quick at
  8029	taking offense, but you donât mind disgracing the whole regiment!â
  8030	The staff captainâs voice began to tremble. âYou have been in the
  8031	regiment next to no time, my lad, youâre here today and tomorrow
  8032	youâll be appointed adjutant somewhere and can snap your fingers when
  8033	it is said âThere are thieves among the PÃ¡vlograd officers!â But
  8034	itâs not all the same to us! Am I not right, DenÃ­sov? Itâs not the
  8035	same!â
  8036	
  8037	DenÃ­sov remained silent and did not move, but occasionally looked with
  8038	his glittering black eyes at RostÃ³v.
  8039	
  8040	âYou value your own pride and donât wish to apologize,â continued
  8041	the staff captain, âbut we old fellows, who have grown up in and, God
  8042	willing, are going to die in the regiment, we prize the honor of the
  8043	regiment, and BogdÃ¡nich knows it. Oh, we do prize it, old fellow! And
  8044	all this is not right, itâs not right! You may take offense or not but
  8045	I always stick to mother truth. Itâs not right!â
  8046	
  8047	And the staff captain rose and turned away from RostÃ³v.
  8048	
  8049	âThatâs twue, devil take it!â shouted DenÃ­sov, jumping up. âNow
  8050	then, WostÃ³v, now then!â
  8051	
  8052	RostÃ³v, growing red and pale alternately, looked first at one officer
  8053	and then at the other.
  8054	
  8055	âNo, gentlemen, no... you mustnât think... I quite understand.
  8056	Youâre wrong to think that of me... I... for me... for the honor of
  8057	the regiment Iâd... Ah well, Iâll show that in action, and for me
  8058	the honor of the flag... Well, never mind, itâs true Iâm to blame,
  8059	to blame all round. Well, what else do you want?...â
  8060	
  8061	âCome, thatâs right, Count!â cried the staff captain, turning
  8062	round and clapping RostÃ³v on the shoulder with his big hand.
  8063	
  8064	âI tell you,â shouted DenÃ­sov, âheâs a fine fellow.â
  8065	
  8066	âThatâs better, Count,â said the staff captain, beginning to
  8067	address RostÃ³v by his title, as if in recognition of his confession.
  8068	âGo and apologize, your excellency. Yes, go!â
  8069	
  8070	âGentlemen, Iâll do anything. No one shall hear a word from me,â
  8071	said RostÃ³v in an imploring voice, âbut I canât apologize, by God I
  8072	canât, do what you will! How can I go and apologize like a little boy
  8073	asking forgiveness?â
  8074	
  8075	DenÃ­sov began to laugh.
  8076	
  8077	âItâll be worse for you. BogdÃ¡nich is vindictive and youâll pay
  8078	for your obstinacy,â said KÃ­rsten.
  8079	
  8080	âNo, on my word itâs not obstinacy! I canât describe the feeling.
  8081	I canât...â
  8082	
  8083	âWell, itâs as you like,â said the staff captain. âAnd what has
  8084	become of that scoundrel?â he asked DenÃ­sov.
  8085	
  8086	âHe has weported himself sick, heâs to be stwuck off the list
  8087	tomowwow,â muttered DenÃ­sov.
  8088	
  8089	âIt is an illness, thereâs no other way of explaining it,â said
  8090	the staff captain.
  8091	
  8092	âIllness or not, heâd better not cwoss my path. Iâd kill him!â
  8093	shouted DenÃ­sov in a bloodthirsty tone.
  8094	
  8095	Just then ZherkÃ³v entered the room.
  8096	
  8097	âWhat brings you here?â cried the officers turning to the newcomer.
  8098	
  8099	âWeâre to go into action, gentlemen! Mack has surrendered with his
  8100	whole army.â
  8101	
  8102	âItâs not true!â
  8103	
  8104	âIâve seen him myself!â
  8105	
  8106	âWhat? Saw the real Mack? With hands and feet?â
  8107	
  8108	âInto action! Into action! Bring him a bottle for such news! But how
  8109	did you come here?â
  8110	
  8111	âIâve been sent back to the regiment all on account of that devil,
  8112	Mack. An Austrian general complained of me. I congratulated him on
  8113	Mackâs arrival... Whatâs the matter, RostÃ³v? You look as if youâd
  8114	just come out of a hot bath.â
  8115	
  8116	âOh, my dear fellow, weâre in such a stew here these last two
  8117	days.â
  8118	
  8119	The regimental adjutant came in and confirmed the news brought by
  8120	ZherkÃ³v. They were under orders to advance next day.
  8121	
  8122	âWeâre going into action, gentlemen!â
  8123	
  8124	âWell, thank God! Weâve been sitting here too long!â
  8125	
  8126	
  8127

  8130	CHAPTER VI
  8131	
  8132	KutÃºzov fell back toward Vienna, destroying behind him the bridges over
  8133	the rivers Inn (at Braunau) and Traun (near Linz). On October 23 the
  8134	Russian troops were crossing the river Enns. At midday the Russian
  8135	baggage train, the artillery, and columns of troops were defiling
  8136	through the town of Enns on both sides of the bridge.
  8137	
  8138	It was a warm, rainy, autumnal day. The wide expanse that opened out
  8139	before the heights on which the Russian batteries stood guarding the
  8140	bridge was at times veiled by a diaphanous curtain of slanting rain, and
  8141	then, suddenly spread out in the sunlight, far-distant objects could
  8142	be clearly seen glittering as though freshly varnished. Down below,
  8143	the little town could be seen with its white, red-roofed houses, its
  8144	cathedral, and its bridge, on both sides of which streamed jostling
  8145	masses of Russian troops. At the bend of the Danube, vessels, an island,
  8146	and a castle with a park surrounded by the waters of the confluence of
  8147	the Enns and the Danube became visible, and the rocky left bank of the
  8148	Danube covered with pine forests, with a mystic background of green
  8149	treetops and bluish gorges. The turrets of a convent stood out beyond a
  8150	wild virgin pine forest, and far away on the other side of the Enns the
  8151	enemyâs horse patrols could be discerned.
  8152	
  8153	Among the field guns on the brow of the hill the general in command of
  8154	the rearguard stood with a staff officer, scanning the country through
  8155	his fieldglass. A little behind them NesvÃ­tski, who had been sent to
  8156	the rearguard by the commander in chief, was sitting on the trail of a
  8157	gun carriage. A Cossack who accompanied him had handed him a knapsack
  8158	and a flask, and NesvÃ­tski was treating some officers to pies and real
  8159	doppelkÃ¼mmel. The officers gladly gathered round him, some on their
  8160	knees, some squatting Turkish fashion on the wet grass.
  8161	
  8162	âYes, the Austrian prince who built that castle was no fool. Itâs
  8163	a fine place! Why are you not eating anything, gentlemen?â NesvÃ­tski
  8164	was saying.
  8165	
  8166	âThank you very much, Prince,â answered one of the officers, pleased
  8167	to be talking to a staff officer of such importance. âItâs a lovely
  8168	place! We passed close to the park and saw two deer... and what a
  8169	splendid house!â
  8170	
  8171	âLook, Prince,â said another, who would have dearly liked to take
  8172	another pie but felt shy, and therefore pretended to be examining the
  8173	countrysideââSee, our infantrymen have already got there. Look there
  8174	in the meadow behind the village, three of them are dragging something.
  8175	Theyâll ransack that castle,â he remarked with evident approval.
  8176	
  8177	âSo they will,â said NesvÃ­tski. âNo, but what I should like,â
  8178	added he, munching a pie in his moist-lipped handsome mouth, âwould be
  8179	to slip in over there.â
  8180	
  8181	He pointed with a smile to a turreted nunnery, and his eyes narrowed and
  8182	gleamed.
  8183	
  8184	âThat would be fine, gentlemen!â
  8185	
  8186	The officers laughed.
  8187	
  8188	âJust to flutter the nuns a bit. They say there are Italian girls
  8189	among them. On my word Iâd give five years of my life for it!â
  8190	
  8191	âThey must be feeling dull, too,â said one of the bolder officers,
  8192	laughing.
  8193	
  8194	Meanwhile the staff officer standing in front pointed out something to
  8195	the general, who looked through his field glass.
  8196	
  8197	âYes, so it is, so it is,â said the general angrily, lowering the
  8198	field glass and shrugging his shoulders, âso it is! Theyâll be fired
  8199	on at the crossing. And why are they dawdling there?â
  8200	
  8201	On the opposite side the enemy could be seen by the naked eye, and from
  8202	their battery a milk-white cloud arose. Then came the distant report of
  8203	a shot, and our troops could be seen hurrying to the crossing.
  8204	
  8205	NesvÃ­tski rose, puffing, and went up to the general, smiling.
  8206	
  8207	âWould not your excellency like a little refreshment?â he said.
  8208	
  8209	âItâs a bad business,â said the general without answering him,
  8210	âour men have been wasting time.â
  8211	
  8212	âHadnât I better ride over, your excellency?â asked NesvÃ­tski.
  8213	
  8214	âYes, please do,â answered the general, and he repeated the order
  8215	that had already once been given in detail: âand tell the hussars
  8216	that they are to cross last and to fire the bridge as I ordered; and the
  8217	inflammable material on the bridge must be reinspected.â
  8218	
  8219	âVery good,â answered NesvÃ­tski.
  8220	
  8221	He called the Cossack with his horse, told him to put away the knapsack
  8222	and flask, and swung his heavy person easily into the saddle.
  8223	
  8224	âIâll really call in on the nuns,â he said to the officers who
  8225	watched him smilingly, and he rode off by the winding path down the
  8226	hill.
  8227	
  8228	âNow then, letâs see how far it will carry, Captain. Just try!â
  8229	said the general, turning to an artillery officer. âHave a little fun
  8230	to pass the time.â
  8231	
  8232	âCrew, to your guns!â commanded the officer.
  8233	
  8234	In a moment the men came running gaily from their campfires and began
  8235	loading.
  8236	
  8237	âOne!â came the command.
  8238	
  8239	Number one jumped briskly aside. The gun rang out with a deafening
  8240	metallic roar, and a whistling grenade flew above the heads of our
  8241	troops below the hill and fell far short of the enemy, a little smoke
  8242	showing the spot where it burst.
  8243	
  8244	The faces of officers and men brightened up at the sound. Everyone got
  8245	up and began watching the movements of our troops below, as plainly
  8246	visible as if but a stoneâs throw away, and the movements of the
  8247	approaching enemy farther off. At the same instant the sun came fully
  8248	out from behind the clouds, and the clear sound of the solitary shot
  8249	and the brilliance of the bright sunshine merged in a single joyous and
  8250	spirited impression.
  8251	
  8252	
  8253	
  8254	
  8255	
  8256	CHAPTER VII
  8257	
  8258	Two of the enemyâs shots had already flown across the bridge, where
  8259	there was a crush. Halfway across stood Prince NesvÃ­tski, who had
  8260	alighted from his horse and whose big body was jammed against the
  8261	railings. He looked back laughing to the Cossack who stood a few
  8262	steps behind him holding two horses by their bridles. Each time Prince
  8263	NesvÃ­tski tried to move on, soldiers and carts pushed him back again
  8264	and pressed him against the railings, and all he could do was to smile.
  8265	
  8266	âWhat a fine fellow you are, friend!â said the Cossack to a convoy
  8267	soldier with a wagon, who was pressing onto the infantrymen who were
  8268	crowded together close to his wheels and his horses. âWhat a fellow!
  8269	You canât wait a moment! Donât you see the general wants to pass?â
  8270	
  8271	But the convoyman took no notice of the word âgeneralâ and shouted
  8272	at the soldiers who were blocking his way. âHi there, boys! Keep to
  8273	the left! Wait a bit.â But the soldiers, crowded together shoulder to
  8274	shoulder, their bayonets interlocking, moved over the bridge in a dense
  8275	mass. Looking down over the rails Prince NesvÃ­tski saw the rapid, noisy
  8276	little waves of the Enns, which rippling and eddying round the piles of
  8277	the bridge chased each other along. Looking on the bridge he saw equally
  8278	uniform living waves of soldiers, shoulder straps, covered shakos,
  8279	knapsacks, bayonets, long muskets, and, under the shakos, faces with
  8280	broad cheekbones, sunken cheeks, and listless tired expressions, and
  8281	feet that moved through the sticky mud that covered the planks of the
  8282	bridge. Sometimes through the monotonous waves of men, like a fleck of
  8283	white foam on the waves of the Enns, an officer, in a cloak and with
  8284	a type of face different from that of the men, squeezed his way along;
  8285	sometimes like a chip of wood whirling in the river, an hussar on foot,
  8286	an orderly, or a townsman was carried through the waves of infantry;
  8287	and sometimes like a log floating down the river, an officersâ or
  8288	companyâs baggage wagon, piled high, leather covered, and hemmed in on
  8289	all sides, moved across the bridge.
  8290	
  8291	âItâs as if a dam had burst,â said the Cossack hopelessly. âAre
  8292	there many more of you to come?â
  8293	
  8294	âA million all but one!â replied a waggish soldier in a torn coat,
  8295	with a wink, and passed on followed by another, an old man.
  8296	
  8297	âIf heâ (he meant the enemy) âbegins popping at the bridge now,â
  8298	said the old soldier dismally to a comrade, âyouâll forget to
  8299	scratch yourself.â
  8300	
  8301	That soldier passed on, and after him came another sitting on a cart.
  8302	
  8303	âWhere the devil have the leg bands been shoved to?â said an
  8304	orderly, running behind the cart and fumbling in the back of it.
  8305	
  8306	And he also passed on with the wagon. Then came some merry soldiers who
  8307	had evidently been drinking.
  8308	
  8309	âAnd then, old fellow, he gives him one in the teeth with the butt
  8310	end of his gun...â a soldier whose greatcoat was well tucked up said
  8311	gaily, with a wide swing of his arm.
  8312	
  8313	âYes, the ham was just delicious...â answered another with a loud
  8314	laugh. And they, too, passed on, so that NesvÃ­tski did not learn who
  8315	had been struck on the teeth, or what the ham had to do with it.
  8316	
  8317	âBah! How they scurry. He just sends a ball and they think theyâll
  8318	all be killed,â a sergeant was saying angrily and reproachfully.
  8319	
  8320	âAs it flies past me, Daddy, the ball I mean,â said a young soldier
  8321	with an enormous mouth, hardly refraining from laughing, âI felt like
  8322	dying of fright. I did, âpon my word, I got that frightened!â said
  8323	he, as if bragging of having been frightened.
  8324	
  8325	That one also passed. Then followed a cart unlike any that had gone
  8326	before. It was a German cart with a pair of horses led by a German, and
  8327	seemed loaded with a whole houseful of effects. A fine brindled cow with
  8328	a large udder was attached to the cart behind. A woman with an unweaned
  8329	baby, an old woman, and a healthy German girl with bright red cheeks
  8330	were sitting on some feather beds. Evidently these fugitives were
  8331	allowed to pass by special permission. The eyes of all the soldiers
  8332	turned toward the women, and while the vehicle was passing at foot pace
  8333	all the soldiersâ remarks related to the two young ones. Every face
  8334	bore almost the same smile, expressing unseemly thoughts about the
  8335	women.
  8336	
  8337	âJust see, the German sausage is making tracks, too!â
  8338	
  8339	âSell me the missis,â said another soldier, addressing the German,
  8340	who, angry and frightened, strode energetically along with downcast
  8341	eyes.
  8342	
  8343	âSee how smart sheâs made herself! Oh, the devils!â
  8344	
  8345	âThere, FedÃ³tov, you should be quartered on them!â
  8346	
  8347	âI have seen as much before now, mate!â
  8348	
  8349	âWhere are you going?â asked an infantry officer who was eating an
  8350	apple, also half smiling as he looked at the handsome girl.
  8351	
  8352	The German closed his eyes, signifying that he did not understand.
  8353	
  8354	âTake it if you like,â said the officer, giving the girl an apple.
  8355	
  8356	The girl smiled and took it. NesvÃ­tski like the rest of the men on the
  8357	bridge did not take his eyes off the women till they had passed. When
  8358	they had gone by, the same stream of soldiers followed, with the same
  8359	kind of talk, and at last all stopped. As often happens, the horses of
  8360	a convoy wagon became restive at the end of the bridge, and the whole
  8361	crowd had to wait.
  8362	
  8363	âAnd why are they stopping? Thereâs no proper order!â said the
  8364	soldiers. âWhere are you shoving to? Devil take you! Canât you wait?
  8365	Itâll be worse if he fires the bridge. See, hereâs an officer jammed
  8366	in tooââdifferent voices were saying in the crowd, as the men looked
  8367	at one another, and all pressed toward the exit from the bridge.
  8368	
  8369	Looking down at the waters of the Enns under the bridge, NesvÃ­tski
  8370	suddenly heard a sound new to him, of something swiftly approaching...
  8371	something big, that splashed into the water.
  8372	
  8373	âJust see where it carries to!â a soldier near by said sternly,
  8374	looking round at the sound.
  8375	
  8376	âEncouraging us to get along quicker,â said another uneasily.
  8377	
  8378	The crowd moved on again. NesvÃ­tski realized that it was a cannon ball.
  8379	
  8380	âHey, Cossack, my horse!â he said. âNow, then, you there! get out
  8381	of the way! Make way!â
  8382	
  8383	With great difficulty he managed to get to his horse, and shouting
  8384	continually he moved on. The soldiers squeezed themselves to make way
  8385	for him, but again pressed on him so that they jammed his leg, and those
  8386	nearest him were not to blame for they were themselves pressed still
  8387	harder from behind.
  8388	
  8389	âNesvÃ­tski, NesvÃ­tski! you numskull!â came a hoarse voice from
  8390	behind him.
  8391	
  8392	NesvÃ­tski looked round and saw, some fifteen paces away but separated
  8393	by the living mass of moving infantry, VÃ¡ska DenÃ­sov, red and shaggy,
  8394	with his cap on the back of his black head and a cloak hanging jauntily
  8395	over his shoulder.
  8396	
  8397	âTell these devils, these fiends, to let me pass!â shouted DenÃ­sov
  8398	evidently in a fit of rage, his coal-black eyes with their bloodshot
  8399	whites glittering and rolling as he waved his sheathed saber in a small
  8400	bare hand as red as his face.
  8401	
  8402	âAh, VÃ¡ska!â joyfully replied NesvÃ­tski. âWhatâs up with
  8403	you?â
  8404	
  8405	âThe squadwon canât pass,â shouted VÃ¡ska DenÃ­sov, showing his
  8406	white teeth fiercely and spurring his black thoroughbred Arab, which
  8407	twitched its ears as the bayonets touched it, and snorted, spurting
  8408	white foam from his bit, tramping the planks of the bridge with his
  8409	hoofs, and apparently ready to jump over the railings had his rider let
  8410	him. âWhat is this? Theyâre like sheep! Just like sheep! Out of the
  8411	way!... Let us pass!... Stop there, you devil with the cart! Iâll hack
  8412	you with my saber!â he shouted, actually drawing his saber from its
  8413	scabbard and flourishing it.
  8414	
  8415	The soldiers crowded against one another with terrified faces, and
  8416	DenÃ­sov joined NesvÃ­tski.
  8417	
  8418	âHowâs it youâre not drunk today?â said NesvÃ­tski when the
  8419	other had ridden up to him.
  8420	
  8421	âThey donât even give one time to dwink!â answered VÃ¡ska
  8422	DenÃ­sov. âThey keep dwagging the wegiment to and fwo all day. If they
  8423	mean to fight, letâs fight. But the devil knows what this is.â
  8424	
  8425	âWhat a dandy you are today!â said NesvÃ­tski, looking at
  8426	DenÃ­sovâs new cloak and saddlecloth.
  8427	
  8428	DenÃ­sov smiled, took out of his sabretache a handkerchief that diffused
  8429	a smell of perfume, and put it to NesvÃ­tskiâs nose.
  8430	
  8431	âOf course. Iâm going into action! Iâve shaved, bwushed my teeth,
  8432	and scented myself.â
  8433	
  8434	The imposing figure of NesvÃ­tski followed by his Cossack, and
  8435	the determination of DenÃ­sov who flourished his sword and shouted
  8436	frantically, had such an effect that they managed to squeeze through
  8437	to the farther side of the bridge and stopped the infantry. Beside the
  8438	bridge NesvÃ­tski found the colonel to whom he had to deliver the order,
  8439	and having done this he rode back.
  8440	
  8441	Having cleared the way DenÃ­sov stopped at the end of the bridge.
  8442	Carelessly holding in his stallion that was neighing and pawing the
  8443	ground, eager to rejoin its fellows, he watched his squadron draw
  8444	nearer. Then the clang of hoofs, as of several horses galloping,
  8445	resounded on the planks of the bridge, and the squadron, officers in
  8446	front and men four abreast, spread across the bridge and began to emerge
  8447	on his side of it.
  8448	
  8449	The infantry who had been stopped crowded near the bridge in the
  8450	trampled mud and gazed with that particular feeling of ill-will,
  8451	estrangement, and ridicule with which troops of different arms usually
  8452	encounter one another at the clean, smart hussars who moved past them in
  8453	regular order.
  8454	
  8455	âSmart lads! Only fit for a fair!â said one.
  8456	
  8457	âWhat good are they? Theyâre led about just for show!â remarked
  8458	another.
  8459	
  8460	âDonât kick up the dust, you infantry!â jested an hussar whose
  8461	prancing horse had splashed mud over some foot soldiers.
  8462	
  8463	âIâd like to put you on a two daysâ march with a knapsack! Your
  8464	fine cords would soon get a bit rubbed,â said an infantryman, wiping
  8465	the mud off his face with his sleeve. âPerched up there, youâre more
  8466	like a bird than a man.â
  8467	
  8468	âThere now, ZÃ­kin, they ought to put you on a horse. Youâd look
  8469	fine,â said a corporal, chaffing a thin little soldier who bent under
  8470	the weight of his knapsack.
  8471	
  8472	âTake a stick between your legs, thatâll suit you for a horse!â
  8473	the hussar shouted back.
  8474	
  8475	
  8476	
  8477	
  8478	
  8479	CHAPTER VIII
  8480	
  8481	The last of the infantry hurriedly crossed the bridge, squeezing
  8482	together as they approached it as if passing through a funnel. At last
  8483	the baggage wagons had all crossed, the crush was less, and the last
  8484	battalion came onto the bridge. Only DenÃ­sovâs squadron of hussars
  8485	remained on the farther side of the bridge facing the enemy, who could
  8486	be seen from the hill on the opposite bank but was not yet visible from
  8487	the bridge, for the horizon as seen from the valley through which the
  8488	river flowed was formed by the rising ground only half a mile away.
  8489	At the foot of the hill lay wasteland over which a few groups of our
  8490	Cossack scouts were moving. Suddenly on the road at the top of the high
  8491	ground, artillery and troops in blue uniform were seen. These were the
  8492	French. A group of Cossack scouts retired down the hill at a trot. All
  8493	the officers and men of DenÃ­sovâs squadron, though they tried to talk
  8494	of other things and to look in other directions, thought only of what
  8495	was there on the hilltop, and kept constantly looking at the patches
  8496	appearing on the skyline, which they knew to be the enemyâs troops.
  8497	The weather had cleared again since noon and the sun was descending
  8498	brightly upon the Danube and the dark hills around it. It was calm, and
  8499	at intervals the bugle calls and the shouts of the enemy could be heard
  8500	from the hill. There was no one now between the squadron and the enemy
  8501	except a few scattered skirmishers. An empty space of some seven hundred
  8502	yards was all that separated them. The enemy ceased firing, and that
  8503	stern, threatening, inaccessible, and intangible line which separates
  8504	two hostile armies was all the more clearly felt.
  8505	
  8506	âOne step beyond that boundary line which resembles the line dividing
  8507	the living from the dead lies uncertainty, suffering, and death. And
  8508	what is there? Who is there?âthere beyond that field, that tree, that
  8509	roof lit up by the sun? No one knows, but one wants to know. You fear
  8510	and yet long to cross that line, and know that sooner or later it must
  8511	be crossed and you will have to find out what is there, just as you will
  8512	inevitably have to learn what lies the other side of death. But you are
  8513	strong, healthy, cheerful, and excited, and are surrounded by other such
  8514	excitedly animated and healthy men.â So thinks, or at any rate
  8515	feels, anyone who comes in sight of the enemy, and that feeling gives
  8516	a particular glamour and glad keenness of impression to everything that
  8517	takes place at such moments.
  8518	
  8519	On the high ground where the enemy was, the smoke of a cannon rose,
  8520	and a ball flew whistling over the heads of the hussar squadron. The
  8521	officers who had been standing together rode off to their places. The
  8522	hussars began carefully aligning their horses. Silence fell on the whole
  8523	squadron. All were looking at the enemy in front and at the squadron
  8524	commander, awaiting the word of command. A second and a third cannon
  8525	ball flew past. Evidently they were firing at the hussars, but the balls
  8526	with rapid rhythmic whistle flew over the heads of the horsemen and fell
  8527	somewhere beyond them. The hussars did not look round, but at the sound
  8528	of each shot, as at the word of command, the whole squadron with its
  8529	rows of faces so alike yet so different, holding its breath while the
  8530	ball flew past, rose in the stirrups and sank back again. The soldiers
  8531	without turning their heads glanced at one another, curious to see their
  8532	comradesâ impression. Every face, from DenÃ­sovâs to that of the
  8533	bugler, showed one common expression of conflict, irritation, and
  8534	excitement, around chin and mouth. The quartermaster frowned, looking
  8535	at the soldiers as if threatening to punish them. Cadet MirÃ³nov ducked
  8536	every time a ball flew past. RostÃ³v on the left flank, mounted on his
  8537	Rookâa handsome horse despite its game legâhad the happy air of a
  8538	schoolboy called up before a large audience for an examination in which
  8539	he feels sure he will distinguish himself. He was glancing at everyone
  8540	with a clear, bright expression, as if asking them to notice how calmly
  8541	he sat under fire. But despite himself, on his face too that same
  8542	indication of something new and stern showed round the mouth.
  8543	
  8544	âWhoâs that curtseying there? Cadet MiwÃ³nov! Thatâs not wight!
  8545	Look at me,â cried DenÃ­sov who, unable to keep still on one spot,
  8546	kept turning his horse in front of the squadron.
  8547	
  8548	The black, hairy, snub-nosed face of VÃ¡ska DenÃ­sov, and his whole
  8549	short sturdy figure with the sinewy hairy hand and stumpy fingers in
  8550	which he held the hilt of his naked saber, looked just as it usually
  8551	did, especially toward evening when he had emptied his second bottle; he
  8552	was only redder than usual. With his shaggy head thrown back like birds
  8553	when they drink, pressing his spurs mercilessly into the sides of his
  8554	good horse, Bedouin, and sitting as though falling backwards in the
  8555	saddle, he galloped to the other flank of the squadron and shouted in
  8556	a hoarse voice to the men to look to their pistols. He rode up to
  8557	KÃ­rsten. The staff captain on his broad-backed, steady mare came at a
  8558	walk to meet him. His face with its long mustache was serious as always,
  8559	only his eyes were brighter than usual.
  8560	
  8561	âWell, what about it?â said he to DenÃ­sov. âIt wonât come to a
  8562	fight. Youâll seeâwe shall retire.â
  8563	
  8564	âThe devil only knows what theyâre about!â muttered DenÃ­sov.
  8565	âAh, WostÃ³v,â he cried noticing the cadetâs bright face,
  8566	âyouâve got it at last.â
  8567	
  8568	And he smiled approvingly, evidently pleased with the cadet. RostÃ³v
  8569	felt perfectly happy. Just then the commander appeared on the bridge.
  8570	DenÃ­sov galloped up to him.
  8571	
  8572	âYour excellency! Let us attack them! Iâll dwive them off.â
  8573	
  8574	âAttack indeed!â said the colonel in a bored voice, puckering up his
  8575	face as if driving off a troublesome fly. âAnd why are you stopping
  8576	here? Donât you see the skirmishers are retreating? Lead the squadron
  8577	back.â
  8578	
  8579	The squadron crossed the bridge and drew out of range of fire without
  8580	having lost a single man. The second squadron that had been in the front
  8581	line followed them across and the last Cossacks quitted the farther side
  8582	of the river.
  8583	
  8584	The two PÃ¡vlograd squadrons, having crossed the bridge, retired up the
  8585	hill one after the other. Their colonel, Karl BogdÃ¡nich Schubert, came
  8586	up to DenÃ­sovâs squadron and rode at a footpace not far from RostÃ³v,
  8587	without taking any notice of him although they were now meeting for the
  8588	first time since their encounter concerning TelyÃ¡nin. RostÃ³v, feeling
  8589	that he was at the front and in the power of a man toward whom he now
  8590	admitted that he had been to blame, did not lift his eyes from the
  8591	colonelâs athletic back, his nape covered with light hair, and his red
  8592	neck. It seemed to RostÃ³v that BogdÃ¡nich was only pretending not
  8593	to notice him, and that his whole aim now was to test the cadetâs
  8594	courage, so he drew himself up and looked around him merrily; then it
  8595	seemed to him that BogdÃ¡nich rode so near in order to show him his
  8596	courage. Next he thought that his enemy would send the squadron on a
  8597	desperate attack just to punish himâRostÃ³v. Then he imagined how,
  8598	after the attack, BogdÃ¡nich would come up to him as he lay wounded and
  8599	would magnanimously extend the hand of reconciliation.
  8600	
  8601	The high-shouldered figure of ZherkÃ³v, familiar to the PÃ¡vlograds as
  8602	he had but recently left their regiment, rode up to the colonel.
  8603	After his dismissal from headquarters ZherkÃ³v had not remained in the
  8604	regiment, saying he was not such a fool as to slave at the front when he
  8605	could get more rewards by doing nothing on the staff, and had succeeded
  8606	in attaching himself as an orderly officer to Prince BagratiÃ³n. He now
  8607	came to his former chief with an order from the commander of the rear
  8608	guard.
  8609	
  8610	âColonel,â he said, addressing RostÃ³vâs enemy with an air of
  8611	gloomy gravity and glancing round at his comrades, âthere is an order
  8612	to stop and fire the bridge.â
  8613	
  8614	âAn order to who?â asked the colonel morosely.
  8615	
  8616	âI donât myself know âto who,ââ replied the cornet in a
  8617	serious tone, âbut the prince told me to âgo and tell the colonel
  8618	that the hussars must return quickly and fire the bridge.ââ
  8619	
  8620	ZherkÃ³v was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up to the
  8621	colonel of hussars with the same order. After him the stout NesvÃ­tski
  8622	came galloping up on a Cossack horse that could scarcely carry his
  8623	weight.
  8624	
  8625	âHowâs this, Colonel?â he shouted as he approached. âI told you
  8626	to fire the bridge, and now someone has gone and blundered; they are all
  8627	beside themselves over there and one canât make anything out.â
  8628	
  8629	The colonel deliberately stopped the regiment and turned to NesvÃ­tski.
  8630	
  8631	âYou spoke to me of inflammable material,â said he, âbut you said
  8632	nothing about firing it.â
  8633	
  8634	âBut, my dear sir,â said NesvÃ­tski as he drew up, taking off his
  8635	cap and smoothing his hair wet with perspiration with his plump hand,
  8636	âwasnât I telling you to fire the bridge, when inflammable material
  8637	had been put in position?â
  8638	
  8639	âI am not your âdear sir,â Mr. Staff Officer, and you did not tell
  8640	me to burn the bridge! I know the service, and it is my habit orders
  8641	strictly to obey. You said the bridge would be burned, but who would it
  8642	burn, I could not know by the holy spirit!â
  8643	
  8644	âAh, thatâs always the way!â said NesvÃ­tski with a wave of the
  8645	hand. âHow did you get here?â said he, turning to ZherkÃ³v.
  8646	
  8647	âOn the same business. But you are damp! Let me wring you out!â
  8648	
  8649	âYou were saying, Mr. Staff Officer...â continued the colonel in an
  8650	offended tone.
  8651	
  8652	âColonel,â interrupted the officer of the suite, âYou must be
  8653	quick or the enemy will bring up his guns to use grapeshot.â
  8654	
  8655	The colonel looked silently at the officer of the suite, at the stout
  8656	staff officer, and at ZherkÃ³v, and he frowned.
  8657	
  8658	âI will the bridge fire,â he said in a solemn tone as if to announce
  8659	that in spite of all the unpleasantness he had to endure he would still
  8660	do the right thing.
  8661	
  8662	Striking his horse with his long muscular legs as if it were to blame
  8663	for everything, the colonel moved forward and ordered the second
  8664	squadron, that in which RostÃ³v was serving under DenÃ­sov, to return to
  8665	the bridge.
  8666	
  8667	âThere, itâs just as I thought,â said RostÃ³v to himself. âHe
  8668	wishes to test me!â His heart contracted and the blood rushed to his
  8669	face. âLet him see whether I am a coward!â he thought.
  8670	
  8671	Again on all the bright faces of the squadron the serious expression
  8672	appeared that they had worn when under fire. RostÃ³v watched his enemy,
  8673	the colonel, closelyâto find in his face confirmation of his own
  8674	conjecture, but the colonel did not once glance at RostÃ³v, and looked
  8675	as he always did when at the front, solemn and stern. Then came the word
  8676	of command.
  8677	
  8678	âLook sharp! Look sharp!â several voices repeated around him.
  8679	
  8680	Their sabers catching in the bridles and their spurs jingling, the
  8681	hussars hastily dismounted, not knowing what they were to do. The men
  8682	were crossing themselves. RostÃ³v no longer looked at the colonel, he
  8683	had no time. He was afraid of falling behind the hussars, so much afraid
  8684	that his heart stood still. His hand trembled as he gave his horse into
  8685	an orderlyâs charge, and he felt the blood rush to his heart with
  8686	a thud. DenÃ­sov rode past him, leaning back and shouting something.
  8687	RostÃ³v saw nothing but the hussars running all around him, their spurs
  8688	catching and their sabers clattering.
  8689	
  8690	âStretchers!â shouted someone behind him.
  8691	
  8692	RostÃ³v did not think what this call for stretchers meant; he ran on,
  8693	trying only to be ahead of the others; but just at the bridge, not
  8694	looking at the ground, he came on some sticky, trodden mud, stumbled,
  8695	and fell on his hands. The others outstripped him.
  8696	
  8697	âAt boss zides, Captain,â he heard the voice of the colonel, who,
  8698	having ridden ahead, had pulled up his horse near the bridge, with a
  8699	triumphant, cheerful face.
  8700	
  8701	RostÃ³v wiping his muddy hands on his breeches looked at his enemy and
  8702	was about to run on, thinking that the farther he went to the front
  8703	the better. But BogdÃ¡nich, without looking at or recognizing RostÃ³v,
  8704	shouted to him:
  8705	
  8706	âWhoâs that running on the middle of the bridge? To the right! Come
  8707	back, Cadet!â he cried angrily; and turning to DenÃ­sov, who, showing
  8708	off his courage, had ridden on to the planks of the bridge:
  8709	
  8710	âWhy run risks, Captain? You should dismount,â he said.
  8711	
  8712	âOh, every bullet has its billet,â answered VÃ¡ska DenÃ­sov, turning
  8713	in his saddle.
  8714	
  8715	
  8716	Meanwhile NesvÃ­tski, ZherkÃ³v, and the officer of the suite were
  8717	standing together out of range of the shots, watching, now the small
  8718	group of men with yellow shakos, dark-green jackets braided with cord,
  8719	and blue riding breeches, who were swarming near the bridge, and then at
  8720	what was approaching in the distance from the opposite sideâthe blue
  8721	uniforms and groups with horses, easily recognizable as artillery.
  8722	
  8723	âWill they burn the bridge or not? Whoâll get there first? Will they
  8724	get there and fire the bridge or will the French get within grapeshot
  8725	range and wipe them out?â These were the questions each man of the
  8726	troops on the high ground above the bridge involuntarily asked himself
  8727	with a sinking heartâwatching the bridge and the hussars in the bright
  8728	evening light and the blue tunics advancing from the other side with
  8729	their bayonets and guns.
  8730	
  8731	âUgh. The hussars will get it hot!â said NesvÃ­tski; âthey are
  8732	within grapeshot range now.â
  8733	
  8734	âHe shouldnât have taken so many men,â said the officer of the
  8735	suite.
  8736	
  8737	âTrue enough,â answered NesvÃ­tski; âtwo smart fellows could have
  8738	done the job just as well.â
  8739	
  8740	âAh, your excellency,â put in ZherkÃ³v, his eyes fixed on the
  8741	hussars, but still with that naÃ¯ve air that made it impossible to know
  8742	whether he was speaking in jest or in earnest. âAh, your excellency!
  8743	How you look at things! Send two men? And who then would give us the
  8744	VladÃ­mir medal and ribbon? But now, even if they do get peppered, the
  8745	squadron may be recommended for honors and he may get a ribbon. Our
  8746	BogdÃ¡nich knows how things are done.â
  8747	
  8748	âThere now!â said the officer of the suite, âthatâs
  8749	grapeshot.â
  8750	
  8751	He pointed to the French guns, the limbers of which were being detached
  8752	and hurriedly removed.
  8753	
  8754	On the French side, amid the groups with cannon, a cloud of smoke
  8755	appeared, then a second and a third almost simultaneously, and at the
  8756	moment when the first report was heard a fourth was seen. Then two
  8757	reports one after another, and a third.
  8758	
  8759	âOh! Oh!â groaned NesvÃ­tski as if in fierce pain, seizing the
  8760	officer of the suite by the arm. âLook! A man has fallen! Fallen,
  8761	fallen!â
  8762	
  8763	âTwo, I think.â
  8764	
  8765	âIf I were Tsar I would never go to war,â said NesvÃ­tski, turning
  8766	away.
  8767	
  8768	The French guns were hastily reloaded. The infantry in their blue
  8769	uniforms advanced toward the bridge at a run. Smoke appeared again
  8770	but at irregular intervals, and grapeshot cracked and rattled onto the
  8771	bridge. But this time NesvÃ­tski could not see what was happening there,
  8772	as a dense cloud of smoke arose from it. The hussars had succeeded in
  8773	setting it on fire and the French batteries were now firing at them, no
  8774	longer to hinder them but because the guns were trained and there was
  8775	someone to fire at.
  8776	
  8777	The French had time to fire three rounds of grapeshot before the hussars
  8778	got back to their horses. Two were misdirected and the shot went too
  8779	high, but the last round fell in the midst of a group of hussars and
  8780	knocked three of them over.
  8781	
  8782	RostÃ³v, absorbed by his relations with BogdÃ¡nich, had paused on the
  8783	bridge not knowing what to do. There was no one to hew down (as he
  8784	had always imagined battles to himself), nor could he help to fire the
  8785	bridge because he had not brought any burning straw with him like the
  8786	other soldiers. He stood looking about him, when suddenly he heard a
  8787	rattle on the bridge as if nuts were being spilt, and the hussar nearest
  8788	to him fell against the rails with a groan. RostÃ³v ran up to him with
  8789	the others. Again someone shouted, âStretchers!â Four men seized the
  8790	hussar and began lifting him.
  8791	
  8792	âOooh! For Christâs sake let me alone!â cried the wounded man, but
  8793	still he was lifted and laid on the stretcher.
  8794	
  8795	Nicholas RostÃ³v turned away and, as if searching for something, gazed
  8796	into the distance, at the waters of the Danube, at the sky, and at the
  8797	sun. How beautiful the sky looked; how blue, how calm, and how deep!
  8798	How bright and glorious was the setting sun! With what soft glitter the
  8799	waters of the distant Danube shone. And fairer still were the faraway
  8800	blue mountains beyond the river, the nunnery, the mysterious gorges, and
  8801	the pine forests veiled in the mist of their summits... There was peace
  8802	and happiness... âI should wish for nothing else, nothing, if only I
  8803	were there,â thought RostÃ³v. âIn myself alone and in that sunshine
  8804	there is so much happiness; but here... groans, suffering, fear, and
  8805	this uncertainty and hurry... Thereâthey are shouting again, and
  8806	again are all running back somewhere, and I shall run with them, and it,
  8807	death, is here above me and around... Another instant and I shall never
  8808	again see the sun, this water, that gorge!...â
  8809	
  8810	At that instant the sun began to hide behind the clouds, and other
  8811	stretchers came into view before RostÃ³v. And the fear of death and of
  8812	the stretchers, and love of the sun and of life, all merged into one
  8813	feeling of sickening agitation.
  8814	
  8815	âO Lord God! Thou who art in that heaven, save, forgive, and protect
  8816	me!â RostÃ³v whispered.
  8817	
  8818	The hussars ran back to the men who held their horses; their voices
  8819	sounded louder and calmer, the stretchers disappeared from sight.
  8820	
  8821	âWell, fwiend? So youâve smelt powdah!â shouted VÃ¡ska DenÃ­sov
  8822	just above his ear.
  8823	
  8824	âItâs all over; but I am a cowardâyes, a coward!â thought
  8825	RostÃ³v, and sighing deeply he took Rook, his horse, which stood resting
  8826	one foot, from the orderly and began to mount.
  8827	
  8828	âWas that grapeshot?â he asked DenÃ­sov.
  8829	
  8830	âYes and no mistake!â cried DenÃ­sov. âYou worked like wegular
  8831	bwicks and itâs nasty work! An attackâs pleasant work! Hacking
  8832	away at the dogs! But this sort of thing is the very devil, with them
  8833	shooting at you like a target.â
  8834	
  8835	And DenÃ­sov rode up to a group that had stopped near RostÃ³v, composed
  8836	of the colonel, NesvÃ­tski, ZherkÃ³v, and the officer from the suite.
  8837	
  8838	âWell, it seems that no one has noticed,â thought RostÃ³v. And this
  8839	was true. No one had taken any notice, for everyone knew the sensation
  8840	which the cadet under fire for the first time had experienced.
  8841	
  8842	âHereâs something for you to report,â said ZherkÃ³v. âSee if I
  8843	donât get promoted to a sublieutenancy.â
  8844	
  8845	âInform the prince that I the bridge fired!â said the colonel
  8846	triumphantly and gaily.
  8847	
  8848	âAnd if he asks about the losses?â
  8849	
  8850	âA trifle,â said the colonel in his bass voice: âtwo hussars
  8851	wounded, and one knocked out,â he added, unable to restrain a happy
  8852	smile, and pronouncing the phrase âknocked outâ with ringing
  8853	distinctness.
  8854	
  8855	
  8856	
  8857	
  8858	
  8859	CHAPTER IX
  8860	
  8861	Pursued by the French army of a hundred thousand men under the command
  8862	of Bonaparte, encountering a population that was unfriendly to it,
  8863	losing confidence in its allies, suffering from shortness of supplies,
  8864	and compelled to act under conditions of war unlike anything that had
  8865	been foreseen, the Russian army of thirty-five thousand men commanded
  8866	by KutÃºzov was hurriedly retreating along the Danube, stopping where
  8867	overtaken by the enemy and fighting rearguard actions only as far as
  8868	necessary to enable it to retreat without losing its heavy equipment.
  8869	There had been actions at Lambach, Amstetten, and Melk; but despite the
  8870	courage and enduranceâacknowledged even by the enemyâwith which the
  8871	Russians fought, the only consequence of these actions was a yet more
  8872	rapid retreat. Austrian troops that had escaped capture at Ulm and had
  8873	joined KutÃºzov at Braunau now separated from the Russian army, and
  8874	KutÃºzov was left with only his own weak and exhausted forces. The
  8875	defense of Vienna was no longer to be thought of. Instead of an
  8876	offensive, the plan of which, carefully prepared in accord with the
  8877	modern science of strategics, had been handed to KutÃºzov when he was in
  8878	Vienna by the Austrian Hofkriegsrath, the sole and almost unattainable
  8879	aim remaining for him was to effect a junction with the forces that were
  8880	advancing from Russia, without losing his army as Mack had done at Ulm.
  8881	
  8882	On the twenty-eighth of October KutÃºzov with his army crossed to the
  8883	left bank of the Danube and took up a position for the first time
  8884	with the river between himself and the main body of the French. On the
  8885	thirtieth he attacked Mortierâs division, which was on the left bank,
  8886	and broke it up. In this action for the first time trophies were taken:
  8887	banners, cannon, and two enemy generals. For the first time, after a
  8888	fortnightâs retreat, the Russian troops had halted and after a fight
  8889	had not only held the field but had repulsed the French. Though the
  8890	troops were ill-clad, exhausted, and had lost a third of their number
  8891	in killed, wounded, sick, and stragglers; though a number of sick and
  8892	wounded had been abandoned on the other side of the Danube with a letter
  8893	in which KutÃºzov entrusted them to the humanity of the enemy; and
  8894	though the big hospitals and the houses in Krems converted into military
  8895	hospitals could no longer accommodate all the sick and wounded, yet the
  8896	stand made at Krems and the victory over Mortier raised the spirits of
  8897	the army considerably. Throughout the whole army and at headquarters
  8898	most joyful though erroneous rumors were rife of the imaginary approach
  8899	of columns from Russia, of some victory gained by the Austrians, and of
  8900	the retreat of the frightened Bonaparte.
  8901	
  8902	Prince Andrew during the battle had been in attendance on the Austrian
  8903	General Schmidt, who was killed in the action. His horse had been
  8904	wounded under him and his own arm slightly grazed by a bullet. As a mark
  8905	of the commander in chiefâs special favor he was sent with the news of
  8906	this victory to the Austrian court, now no longer at Vienna (which was
  8907	threatened by the French) but at BrÃ¼nn. Despite his apparently delicate
  8908	build Prince Andrew could endure physical fatigue far better than many
  8909	very muscular men, and on the night of the battle, having arrived
  8910	at Krems excited but not weary, with dispatches from DokhtÃºrov to
  8911	KutÃºzov, he was sent immediately with a special dispatch to BrÃ¼nn.
  8912	To be so sent meant not only a reward but an important step toward
  8913	promotion.
  8914	
  8915	The night was dark but starry, the road showed black in the snow that
  8916	had fallen the previous dayâthe day of the battle. Reviewing his
  8917	impressions of the recent battle, picturing pleasantly to himself the
  8918	impression his news of a victory would create, or recalling the send-off
  8919	given him by the commander in chief and his fellow officers, Prince
  8920	Andrew was galloping along in a post chaise enjoying the feelings of a
  8921	man who has at length begun to attain a long-desired happiness. As soon
  8922	as he closed his eyes his ears seemed filled with the rattle of the
  8923	wheels and the sensation of victory. Then he began to imagine that
  8924	the Russians were running away and that he himself was killed, but he
  8925	quickly roused himself with a feeling of joy, as if learning afresh that
  8926	this was not so but that on the contrary the French had run away. He
  8927	again recalled all the details of the victory and his own calm courage
  8928	during the battle, and feeling reassured he dozed off.... The dark
  8929	starry night was followed by a bright cheerful morning. The snow was
  8930	thawing in the sunshine, the horses galloped quickly, and on both sides
  8931	of the road were forests of different kinds, fields, and villages.
  8932	
  8933	At one of the post stations he overtook a convoy of Russian wounded.
  8934	The Russian officer in charge of the transport lolled back in the front
  8935	cart, shouting and scolding a soldier with coarse abuse. In each of
  8936	the long German carts six or more pale, dirty, bandaged men were being
  8937	jolted over the stony road. Some of them were talking (he heard Russian
  8938	words), others were eating bread; the more severely wounded looked
  8939	silently, with the languid interest of sick children, at the envoy
  8940	hurrying past them.
  8941	
  8942	Prince Andrew told his driver to stop, and asked a soldier in what
  8943	action they had been wounded. âDay before yesterday, on the Danube,â
  8944	answered the soldier. Prince Andrew took out his purse and gave the
  8945	soldier three gold pieces.
  8946	
  8947	âThatâs for them all,â he said to the officer who came up.
  8948	
  8949	âGet well soon, lads!â he continued, turning to the soldiers.
  8950	âThereâs plenty to do still.â
  8951	
  8952	âWhat news, sir?â asked the officer, evidently anxious to start a
  8953	conversation.
  8954	
  8955	âGood news!... Go on!â he shouted to the driver, and they galloped
  8956	on.
  8957	
  8958	It was already quite dark when Prince Andrew rattled over the paved
  8959	streets of BrÃ¼nn and found himself surrounded by high buildings, the
  8960	lights of shops, houses, and street lamps, fine carriages, and all that
  8961	atmosphere of a large and active town which is always so attractive to a
  8962	soldier after camp life. Despite his rapid journey and sleepless night,
  8963	Prince Andrew when he drove up to the palace felt even more vigorous and
  8964	alert than he had done the day before. Only his eyes gleamed feverishly
  8965	and his thoughts followed one another with extraordinary clearness and
  8966	rapidity. He again vividly recalled the details of the battle, no longer
  8967	dim, but definite and in the concise form in which he imagined himself
  8968	stating them to the Emperor Francis. He vividly imagined the casual
  8969	questions that might be put to him and the answers he would give. He
  8970	expected to be at once presented to the Emperor. At the chief entrance
  8971	to the palace, however, an official came running out to meet him, and
  8972	learning that he was a special messenger led him to another entrance.
  8973	
  8974	âTo the right from the corridor, Euer Hochgeboren! There you will find
  8975	the adjutant on duty,â said the official. âHe will conduct you to
  8976	the Minister of War.â
  8977	
  8978	The adjutant on duty, meeting Prince Andrew, asked him to wait, and went
  8979	in to the Minister of War. Five minutes later he returned and bowing
  8980	with particular courtesy ushered Prince Andrew before him along a
  8981	corridor to the cabinet where the Minister of War was at work. The
  8982	adjutant by his elaborate courtesy appeared to wish to ward off any
  8983	attempt at familiarity on the part of the Russian messenger.
  8984	
  8985	Prince Andrewâs joyous feeling was considerably weakened as he
  8986	approached the door of the ministerâs room. He felt offended, and
  8987	without his noticing it the feeling of offense immediately turned into
  8988	one of disdain which was quite uncalled for. His fertile mind instantly
  8989	suggested to him a point of view which gave him a right to despise
  8990	the adjutant and the minister. âAway from the smell of powder, they
  8991	probably think it easy to gain victories!â he thought. His eyes
  8992	narrowed disdainfully, he entered the room of the Minister of War with
  8993	peculiarly deliberate steps. This feeling of disdain was heightened
  8994	when he saw the minister seated at a large table reading some papers
  8995	and making pencil notes on them, and for the first two or three minutes
  8996	taking no notice of his arrival. A wax candle stood at each side of the
  8997	ministerâs bent bald head with its gray temples. He went on reading
  8998	to the end, without raising his eyes at the opening of the door and the
  8999	sound of footsteps.
  9000	
  9001	âTake this and deliver it,â said he to his adjutant, handing him the
  9002	papers and still taking no notice of the special messenger.
  9003	
  9004	Prince Andrew felt that either the actions of KutÃºzovâs army
  9005	interested the Minister of War less than any of the other matters he was
  9006	concerned with, or he wanted to give the Russian special messenger that
  9007	impression. âBut that is a matter of perfect indifference to me,â he
  9008	thought. The minister drew the remaining papers together, arranged them
  9009	evenly, and then raised his head. He had an intellectual and distinctive
  9010	head, but the instant he turned to Prince Andrew the firm, intelligent
  9011	expression on his face changed in a way evidently deliberate and
  9012	habitual to him. His face took on the stupid artificial smile (which
  9013	does not even attempt to hide its artificiality) of a man who is
  9014	continually receiving many petitioners one after another.
  9015	
  9016	âFrom General Field Marshal KutÃºzov?â he asked. âI hope it is
  9017	good news? There has been an encounter with Mortier? A victory? It was
  9018	high time!â
  9019	
  9020	He took the dispatch which was addressed to him and began to read it
  9021	with a mournful expression.
  9022	
  9023	âOh, my God! My God! Schmidt!â he exclaimed in German. âWhat a
  9024	calamity! What a calamity!â
  9025	
  9026	Having glanced through the dispatch he laid it on the table and looked
  9027	at Prince Andrew, evidently considering something.
  9028	
  9029	âAh what a calamity! You say the affair was decisive? But Mortier is
  9030	not captured.â Again he pondered. âI am very glad you have brought
  9031	good news, though Schmidtâs death is a heavy price to pay for the
  9032	victory. His Majesty will no doubt wish to see you, but not today. I
  9033	thank you! You must have a rest. Be at the levee tomorrow after the
  9034	parade. However, I will let you know.â
  9035	
  9036	The stupid smile, which had left his face while he was speaking,
  9037	reappeared.
  9038	
  9039	âAu revoir! Thank you very much. His Majesty will probably desire to
  9040	see you,â he added, bowing his head.
  9041	
  9042	When Prince Andrew left the palace he felt that all the interest
  9043	and happiness the victory had afforded him had been now left in the
  9044	indifferent hands of the Minister of War and the polite adjutant. The
  9045	whole tenor of his thoughts instantaneously changed; the battle seemed
  9046	the memory of a remote event long past.
  9047	
  9048	
  9049	
  9050	
  9051	
  9052	CHAPTER X
  9053	
  9054	Prince Andrew stayed at BrÃ¼nn with BilÃ­bin, a Russian acquaintance of
  9055	his in the diplomatic service.
  9056	
  9057	âAh, my dear prince! I could not have a more welcome visitor,â
  9058	said BilÃ­bin as he came out to meet Prince Andrew. âFranz, put the
  9059	princeâs things in my bedroom,â said he to the servant who was
  9060	ushering BolkÃ³nski in. âSo youâre a messenger of victory, eh?
  9061	Splendid! And I am sitting here ill, as you see.â
  9062	
  9063	After washing and dressing, Prince Andrew came into the diplomatâs
  9064	luxurious study and sat down to the dinner prepared for him. BilÃ­bin
  9065	settled down comfortably beside the fire.
  9066	
  9067	After his journey and the campaign during which he had been deprived of
  9068	all the comforts of cleanliness and all the refinements of life, Prince
  9069	Andrew felt a pleasant sense of repose among luxurious surroundings such
  9070	as he had been accustomed to from childhood. Besides it was pleasant,
  9071	after his reception by the Austrians, to speak if not in Russian
  9072	(for they were speaking French) at least with a Russian who would, he
  9073	supposed, share the general Russian antipathy to the Austrians which was
  9074	then particularly strong.
  9075	
  9076	BilÃ­bin was a man of thirty-five, a bachelor, and of the same circle as
  9077	Prince Andrew. They had known each other previously in Petersburg, but
  9078	had become more intimate when Prince Andrew was in Vienna with KutÃºzov.
  9079	Just as Prince Andrew was a young man who gave promise of rising high
  9080	in the military profession, so to an even greater extent BilÃ­bin gave
  9081	promise of rising in his diplomatic career. He still a young man but
  9082	no longer a young diplomat, as he had entered the service at the age
  9083	of sixteen, had been in Paris and Copenhagen, and now held a rather
  9084	important post in Vienna. Both the foreign minister and our ambassador
  9085	in Vienna knew him and valued him. He was not one of those many
  9086	diplomats who are esteemed because they have certain negative qualities,
  9087	avoid doing certain things, and speak French. He was one of those,
  9088	who, liking work, knew how to do it, and despite his indolence would
  9089	sometimes spend a whole night at his writing table. He worked well
  9090	whatever the import of his work. It was not the question âWhat for?â
  9091	but the question âHow?â that interested him. What the diplomatic
  9092	matter might be he did not care, but it gave him great pleasure to
  9093	prepare a circular, memorandum, or report, skillfully, pointedly, and
  9094	elegantly. BilÃ­binâs services were valued not only for what he wrote,
  9095	but also for his skill in dealing and conversing with those in the
  9096	highest spheres.
  9097	
  9098	BilÃ­bin liked conversation as he liked work, only when it could be
  9099	made elegantly witty. In society he always awaited an opportunity to say
  9100	something striking and took part in a conversation only when that was
  9101	possible. His conversation was always sprinkled with wittily original,
  9102	finished phrases of general interest. These sayings were prepared in the
  9103	inner laboratory of his mind in a portable form as if intentionally, so
  9104	that insignificant society people might carry them from drawing room to
  9105	drawing room. And, in fact, BilÃ­binâs witticisms were hawked about
  9106	in the Viennese drawing rooms and often had an influence on matters
  9107	considered important.
  9108	
  9109	His thin, worn, sallow face was covered with deep wrinkles, which always
  9110	looked as clean and well washed as the tips of oneâs fingers after a
  9111	Russian bath. The movement of these wrinkles formed the principal play
  9112	of expression on his face. Now his forehead would pucker into deep folds
  9113	and his eyebrows were lifted, then his eyebrows would descend and
  9114	deep wrinkles would crease his cheeks. His small, deep-set eyes always
  9115	twinkled and looked out straight.
  9116	
  9117	âWell, now tell me about your exploits,â said he.
  9118	
  9119	BolkÃ³nski, very modestly without once mentioning himself, described the
  9120	engagement and his reception by the Minister of War.
  9121	
  9122	âThey received me and my news as one receives a dog in a game of
  9123	skittles,â said he in conclusion.
  9124	
  9125	BilÃ­bin smiled and the wrinkles on his face disappeared.
  9126	
  9127	âCependant, mon cher,â he remarked, examining his nails from a
  9128	distance and puckering the skin above his left eye, âmalgrÃ© la haute
  9129	estime que je professe pour the Orthodox Russian army, jâavoue que
  9130	votre victoire nâest pas des plus victorieuses.â *
  9131	
  9132	     * âBut my dear fellow, with all my respect for the Orthodox
  9133	     Russian army, I must say that your victory was not
  9134	     particularly victorious.â
  9135	
  9136	
  9137	He went on talking in this way in French, uttering only those words in
  9138	Russian on which he wished to put a contemptuous emphasis.
  9139	
  9140	âCome now! You with all your forces fall on the unfortunate Mortier
  9141	and his one division, and even then Mortier slips through your fingers!
  9142	Whereâs the victory?â
  9143	
  9144	âBut seriously,â said Prince Andrew, âwe can at any rate say
  9145	without boasting that it was a little better than at Ulm...â
  9146	
  9147	âWhy didnât you capture one, just one, marshal for us?â
  9148	
  9149	âBecause not everything happens as one expects or with the smoothness
  9150	of a parade. We had expected, as I told you, to get at their rear by
  9151	seven in the morning but had not reached it by five in the afternoon.â
  9152	
  9153	âAnd why didnât you do it at seven in the morning? You ought to have
  9154	been there at seven in the morning,â returned BilÃ­bin with a smile.
  9155	âYou ought to have been there at seven in the morning.â
  9156	
  9157	âWhy did you not succeed in impressing on Bonaparte by diplomatic
  9158	methods that he had better leave Genoa alone?â retorted Prince Andrew
  9159	in the same tone.
  9160	
  9161	âI know,â interrupted BilÃ­bin, âyouâre thinking itâs very
  9162	easy to take marshals, sitting on a sofa by the fire! That is true, but
  9163	still why didnât you capture him? So donât be surprised if not only
  9164	the Minister of War but also his Most August Majesty the Emperor and
  9165	King Francis is not much delighted by your victory. Even I, a poor
  9166	secretary of the Russian Embassy, do not feel any need in token of my
  9167	joy to give my Franz a thaler, or let him go with his Liebchen to the
  9168	Prater... True, we have no Prater here...â
  9169	
  9170	He looked straight at Prince Andrew and suddenly unwrinkled his
  9171	forehead.
  9172	
  9173	âIt is now my turn to ask you âwhy?â mon cher,â said BolkÃ³nski.
  9174	âI confess I do not understand: perhaps there are diplomatic
  9175	subtleties here beyond my feeble intelligence, but I canât make it
  9176	out. Mack loses a whole army, the Archduke Ferdinand and the Archduke
  9177	Karl give no signs of life and make blunder after blunder. KutÃºzov
  9178	alone at last gains a real victory, destroying the spell of the
  9179	invincibility of the French, and the Minister of War does not even care
  9180	to hear the details.â
  9181	
  9182	âThatâs just it, my dear fellow. You see itâs hurrah for the Tsar,
  9183	for Russia, for the Orthodox Greek faith! All that is beautiful, but
  9184	what do we, I mean the Austrian court, care for your victories? Bring
  9185	us nice news of a victory by the Archduke Karl or Ferdinand (one
  9186	archdukeâs as good as another, as you know) and even if it is only
  9187	over a fire brigade of Bonaparteâs, that will be another story and
  9188	weâll fire off some cannon! But this sort of thing seems done
  9189	on purpose to vex us. The Archduke Karl does nothing, the Archduke
  9190	Ferdinand disgraces himself. You abandon Vienna, give up its
  9191	defenseâas much as to say: âHeaven is with us, but heaven help you
  9192	and your capital!â The one general whom we all loved, Schmidt, you
  9193	expose to a bullet, and then you congratulate us on the victory! Admit
  9194	that more irritating news than yours could not have been conceived.
  9195	Itâs as if it had been done on purpose, on purpose. Besides, suppose
  9196	you did gain a brilliant victory, if even the Archduke Karl gained a
  9197	victory, what effect would that have on the general course of events?
  9198	Itâs too late now when Vienna is occupied by the French army!â
  9199	
  9200	âWhat? Occupied? Vienna occupied?â
  9201	
  9202	âNot only occupied, but Bonaparte is at SchÃ¶nbrunn, and the count,
  9203	our dear Count Vrbna, goes to him for orders.â
  9204	
  9205	After the fatigues and impressions of the journey, his reception, and
  9206	especially after having dined, BolkÃ³nski felt that he could not take in
  9207	the full significance of the words he heard.
  9208	
  9209	âCount Lichtenfels was here this morning,â BilÃ­bin continued,
  9210	âand showed me a letter in which the parade of the French in Vienna
  9211	was fully described: Prince Murat et tout le tremblement... You see that
  9212	your victory is not a matter for great rejoicing and that you canât be
  9213	received as a savior.â
  9214	
  9215	âReally I donât care about that, I donât care at all,â said
  9216	Prince Andrew, beginning to understand that his news of the battle
  9217	before Krems was really of small importance in view of such events as
  9218	the fall of Austriaâs capital. âHow is it Vienna was taken? What of
  9219	the bridge and its celebrated bridgehead and Prince Auersperg? We heard
  9220	reports that Prince Auersperg was defending Vienna?â he said.
  9221	
  9222	âPrince Auersperg is on this, on our side of the river, and is
  9223	defending usâdoing it very badly, I think, but still he is defending
  9224	us. But Vienna is on the other side. No, the bridge has not yet been
  9225	taken and I hope it will not be, for it is mined and orders have been
  9226	given to blow it up. Otherwise we should long ago have been in the
  9227	mountains of Bohemia, and you and your army would have spent a bad
  9228	quarter of an hour between two fires.â
  9229	
  9230	âBut still this does not mean that the campaign is over,â said
  9231	Prince Andrew.
  9232	
  9233	âWell, I think it is. The bigwigs here think so too, but they
  9234	darenât say so. It will be as I said at the beginning of the campaign,
  9235	it wonât be your skirmishing at DÃ¼rrenstein, or gunpowder at all,
  9236	that will decide the matter, but those who devised it,â said BilÃ­bin
  9237	quoting one of his own mots, releasing the wrinkles on his forehead, and
  9238	pausing. âThe only question is what will come of the meeting between
  9239	the Emperor Alexander and the King of Prussia in Berlin? If Prussia
  9240	joins the Allies, Austriaâs hand will be forced and there will be war.
  9241	If not it is merely a question of settling where the preliminaries of
  9242	the new Campo Formio are to be drawn up.â
  9243	
  9244	âWhat an extraordinary genius!â Prince Andrew suddenly exclaimed,
  9245	clenching his small hand and striking the table with it, âand what
  9246	luck the man has!â
  9247	
  9248	âBuonaparte?â said BilÃ­bin inquiringly, puckering up his forehead
  9249	to indicate that he was about to say something witty. âBuonaparte?â
  9250	he repeated, accentuating the u: âI think, however, now that he lays
  9251	down laws for Austria at SchÃ¶nbrunn, il faut lui faire grÃ¢ce de
  9252	lâu! * I shall certainly adopt an innovation and call him simply
  9253	Bonaparte!â
  9254	
  9255	    * âWe must let him off the u!â
  9256	
  9257	
  9258	âBut joking apart,â said Prince Andrew, âdo you really think the
  9259	campaign is over?â
  9260	
  9261	âThis is what I think. Austria has been made a fool of, and she is
  9262	not used to it. She will retaliate. And she has been fooled in the
  9263	first place because her provinces have been pillagedâthey say the Holy
  9264	Russian army loots terriblyâher army is destroyed, her capital
  9265	taken, and all this for the beaux yeux * of His Sardinian Majesty. And
  9266	thereforeâthis is between ourselvesâI instinctively feel that we
  9267	are being deceived, my instinct tells me of negotiations with France and
  9268	projects for peace, a secret peace concluded separately.â
  9269	
  9270	    * Fine eyes.
  9271	
  9272	âImpossible!â cried Prince Andrew. âThat would be too base.â
  9273	
  9274	âIf we live we shall see,â replied BilÃ­bin, his face again becoming
  9275	smooth as a sign that the conversation was at an end.
  9276	
  9277	When Prince Andrew reached the room prepared for him and lay down in a
  9278	clean shirt on the feather bed with its warmed and fragrant pillows, he
  9279	felt that the battle of which he had brought tidings was far, far
  9280	away from him. The alliance with Prussia, Austriaâs treachery,
  9281	Bonaparteâs new triumph, tomorrowâs levee and parade, and the
  9282	audience with the Emperor Francis occupied his thoughts.
  9283	
  9284	He closed his eyes, and immediately a sound of cannonading, of musketry
  9285	and the rattling of carriage wheels seemed to fill his ears, and now
  9286	again drawn out in a thin line the musketeers were descending the hill,
  9287	the French were firing, and he felt his heart palpitating as he rode
  9288	forward beside Schmidt with the bullets merrily whistling all around,
  9289	and he experienced tenfold the joy of living, as he had not done since
  9290	childhood.
  9291	
  9292	He woke up...
  9293	
  9294	âYes, that all happened!â he said, and, smiling happily to himself
  9295	like a child, he fell into a deep, youthful slumber.
  9296	
  9297	
  9298	
  9299	
  9300	
  9301	CHAPTER XI
  9302	
  9303	Next day he woke late. Recalling his recent impressions, the first
  9304	thought that came into his mind was that today he had to be presented
  9305	to the Emperor Francis; he remembered the Minister of War, the polite
  9306	Austrian adjutant, BilÃ­bin, and last nightâs conversation. Having
  9307	dressed for his attendance at court in full parade uniform, which he
  9308	had not worn for a long time, he went into BilÃ­binâs study fresh,
  9309	animated, and handsome, with his hand bandaged. In the study were four
  9310	gentlemen of the diplomatic corps. With Prince Hippolyte KurÃ¡gin,
  9311	who was a secretary to the embassy, BolkÃ³nski was already acquainted.
  9312	BilÃ­bin introduced him to the others.
  9313	
  9314	The gentlemen assembled at BilÃ­binâs were young, wealthy, gay society
  9315	men, who here, as in Vienna, formed a special set which BilÃ­bin, their
  9316	leader, called les nÃ´tres. * This set, consisting almost exclusively of
  9317	diplomats, evidently had its own interests which had nothing to do with
  9318	war or politics but related to high society, to certain women, and to
  9319	the official side of the service. These gentlemen received Prince
  9320	Andrew as one of themselves, an honor they did not extend to many. From
  9321	politeness and to start conversation, they asked him a few questions
  9322	about the army and the battle, and then the talk went off into merry
  9323	jests and gossip.
  9324	
  9325	    * Ours.
  9326	
  9327	âBut the best of it was,â said one, telling of the misfortune of
  9328	a fellow diplomat, âthat the Chancellor told him flatly that his
  9329	appointment to London was a promotion and that he was so to regard it.
  9330	Can you fancy the figure he cut?...â
  9331	
  9332	âBut the worst of it, gentlemenâI am giving KurÃ¡gin away to
  9333	youâis that that man suffers, and this Don Juan, wicked fellow, is
  9334	taking advantage of it!â
  9335	
  9336	Prince Hippolyte was lolling in a lounge chair with his legs over its
  9337	arm. He began to laugh.
  9338	
  9339	âTell me about that!â he said.
  9340	
  9341	âOh, you Don Juan! You serpent!â cried several voices.
  9342	
  9343	âYou, BolkÃ³nski, donât know,â said BilÃ­bin turning to Prince
  9344	Andrew, âthat all the atrocities of the French army (I nearly said of
  9345	the Russian army) are nothing compared to what this man has been doing
  9346	among the women!â
  9347	
  9348	âLa femme est la compagne de lâhomme,â * announced Prince
  9349	Hippolyte, and began looking through a lorgnette at his elevated legs.
  9350	
  9351	    * âWoman is manâs companion.â
  9352	
  9353	
  9354	BilÃ­bin and the rest of âoursâ burst out laughing in Hippolyteâs
  9355	face, and Prince Andrew saw that Hippolyte, of whomâhe had to
  9356	admitâhe had almost been jealous on his wifeâs account, was the butt
  9357	of this set.
  9358	
  9359	âOh, I must give you a treat,â BilÃ­bin whispered to BolkÃ³nski.
  9360	âKurÃ¡gin is exquisite when he discusses politicsâyou should see his
  9361	gravity!â
  9362	
  9363	He sat down beside Hippolyte and wrinkling his forehead began talking
  9364	to him about politics. Prince Andrew and the others gathered round these
  9365	two.
  9366	
  9367	âThe Berlin cabinet cannot express a feeling of alliance,â began
  9368	Hippolyte gazing round with importance at the others, âwithout
  9369	expressing... as in its last note... you understand... Besides, unless
  9370	His Majesty the Emperor derogates from the principle of our alliance...
  9371	
  9372	âWait, I have not finished...â he said to Prince Andrew, seizing
  9373	him by the arm, âI believe that intervention will be stronger than
  9374	nonintervention. And...â he paused. âFinally one cannot impute the
  9375	nonreceipt of our dispatch of November 18. That is how it will end.â
  9376	And he released BolkÃ³nskiâs arm to indicate that he had now quite
  9377	finished.
  9378	
  9379	âDemosthenes, I know thee by the pebble thou secretest in thy golden
  9380	mouth!â said BilÃ­bin, and the mop of hair on his head moved with
  9381	satisfaction.
  9382	
  9383	Everybody laughed, and Hippolyte louder than anyone. He was evidently
  9384	distressed, and breathed painfully, but could not restrain the wild
  9385	laughter that convulsed his usually impassive features.
  9386	
  9387	âWell now, gentlemen,â said BilÃ­bin, âBolkÃ³nski is my guest in
  9388	this house and in BrÃ¼nn itself. I want to entertain him as far as I
  9389	can, with all the pleasures of life here. If we were in Vienna it would
  9390	be easy, but here, in this wretched Moravian hole, it is more difficult,
  9391	and I beg you all to help me. BrÃ¼nnâs attractions must be shown him.
  9392	You can undertake the theater, I society, and you, Hippolyte, of course
  9393	the women.â
  9394	
  9395	âWe must let him see Amelie, sheâs exquisite!â said one of
  9396	âours,â kissing his finger tips.
  9397	
  9398	âIn general we must turn this bloodthirsty soldier to more humane
  9399	interests,â said BilÃ­bin.
  9400	
  9401	âI shall scarcely be able to avail myself of your hospitality,
  9402	gentlemen, it is already time for me to go,â replied Prince Andrew
  9403	looking at his watch.
  9404	
  9405	âWhere to?â
  9406	
  9407	âTo the Emperor.â
  9408	
  9409	âOh! Oh! Oh!â
  9410	
  9411	âWell, au revoir, BolkÃ³nski! Au revoir, Prince! Come back early to
  9412	dinner,â cried several voices. âWeâll take you in hand.â
  9413	
  9414	âWhen speaking to the Emperor, try as far as you can to praise the way
  9415	that provisions are supplied and the routes indicated,â said BilÃ­bin,
  9416	accompanying him to the hall.
  9417	
  9418	âI should like to speak well of them, but as far as I know the facts,
  9419	I canât,â replied BolkÃ³nski, smiling.
  9420	
  9421	âWell, talk as much as you can, anyway. He has a passion for giving
  9422	audiences, but he does not like talking himself and canât do it, as
  9423	you will see.â
  9424	
  9425	
  9426	
  9427	
  9428	
  9429	CHAPTER XII
  9430	
  9431	At the levee Prince Andrew stood among the Austrian officers as he had
  9432	been told to, and the Emperor Francis merely looked fixedly into his
  9433	face and just nodded to him with his long head. But after it was
  9434	over, the adjutant he had seen the previous day ceremoniously informed
  9435	BolkÃ³nski that the Emperor desired to give him an audience. The Emperor
  9436	Francis received him standing in the middle of the room. Before the
  9437	conversation began Prince Andrew was struck by the fact that the Emperor
  9438	seemed confused and blushed as if not knowing what to say.
  9439	
  9440	âTell me, when did the battle begin?â he asked hurriedly.
  9441	
  9442	Prince Andrew replied. Then followed other questions just as simple:
  9443	âWas KutÃºzov well? When had he left Krems?â and so on. The Emperor
  9444	spoke as if his sole aim were to put a given number of questionsâthe
  9445	answers to these questions, as was only too evident, did not interest
  9446	him.
  9447	
  9448	âAt what oâclock did the battle begin?â asked the Emperor.
  9449	
  9450	âI cannot inform Your Majesty at what oâclock the battle began at
  9451	the front, but at DÃ¼rrenstein, where I was, our attack began after
  9452	five in the afternoon,â replied BolkÃ³nski growing more animated and
  9453	expecting that he would have a chance to give a reliable account, which
  9454	he had ready in his mind, of all he knew and had seen. But the Emperor
  9455	smiled and interrupted him.
  9456	
  9457	âHow many miles?â
  9458	
  9459	âFrom where to where, Your Majesty?â
  9460	
  9461	âFrom DÃ¼rrenstein to Krems.â
  9462	
  9463	âThree and a half miles, Your Majesty.â
  9464	
  9465	âThe French have abandoned the left bank?â
  9466	
  9467	âAccording to the scouts the last of them crossed on rafts during the
  9468	night.â
  9469	
  9470	âIs there sufficient forage in Krems?â
  9471	
  9472	âForage has not been supplied to the extent...â
  9473	
  9474	The Emperor interrupted him.
  9475	
  9476	âAt what oâclock was General Schmidt killed?â
  9477	
  9478	âAt seven oâclock, I believe.â
  9479	
  9480	âAt seven oâclock? Itâs very sad, very sad!â
  9481	
  9482	The Emperor thanked Prince Andrew and bowed. Prince Andrew withdrew and
  9483	was immediately surrounded by courtiers on all sides. Everywhere he
  9484	saw friendly looks and heard friendly words. Yesterdayâs adjutant
  9485	reproached him for not having stayed at the palace, and offered him
  9486	his own house. The Minister of War came up and congratulated him on the
  9487	Maria Theresa Order of the third grade, which the Emperor was conferring
  9488	on him. The Empressâ chamberlain invited him to see Her Majesty. The
  9489	archduchess also wished to see him. He did not know whom to answer, and
  9490	for a few seconds collected his thoughts. Then the Russian ambassador
  9491	took him by the shoulder, led him to the window, and began to talk to
  9492	him.
  9493	
  9494	Contrary to BilÃ­binâs forecast the news he had brought was joyfully
  9495	received. A thanksgiving service was arranged, KutÃºzov was awarded
  9496	the Grand Cross of Maria Theresa, and the whole army received rewards.
  9497	BolkÃ³nski was invited everywhere, and had to spend the whole morning
  9498	calling on the principal Austrian dignitaries. Between four and five
  9499	in the afternoon, having made all his calls, he was returning to
  9500	BilÃ­binâs house thinking out a letter to his father about the battle
  9501	and his visit to BrÃ¼nn. At the door he found a vehicle half full of
  9502	luggage. Franz, BilÃ­binâs man, was dragging a portmanteau with some
  9503	difficulty out of the front door.
  9504	
  9505	Before returning to BilÃ­binâs Prince Andrew had gone to a bookshop
  9506	to provide himself with some books for the campaign, and had spent some
  9507	time in the shop.
  9508	
  9509	âWhat is it?â he asked.
  9510	
  9511	âOh, your excellency!â said Franz, with difficulty rolling the
  9512	portmanteau into the vehicle, âwe are to move on still farther. The
  9513	scoundrel is again at our heels!â
  9514	
  9515	âEh? What?â asked Prince Andrew.
  9516	
  9517	BilÃ­bin came out to meet him. His usually calm face showed excitement.
  9518	
  9519	âThere now! Confess that this is delightful,â said he. âThis
  9520	affair of the Thabor Bridge, at Vienna.... They have crossed without
  9521	striking a blow!â
  9522	
  9523	Prince Andrew could not understand.
  9524	
  9525	âBut where do you come from not to know what every coachman in the
  9526	town knows?â
  9527	
  9528	âI come from the archduchessâ. I heard nothing there.â
  9529	
  9530	âAnd you didnât see that everybody is packing up?â
  9531	
  9532	âI did not... What is it all about?â inquired Prince Andrew
  9533	impatiently.
  9534	
  9535	âWhatâs it all about? Why, the French have crossed the bridge that
  9536	Auersperg was defending, and the bridge was not blown up: so Murat
  9537	is now rushing along the road to BrÃ¼nn and will be here in a day or
  9538	two.â
  9539	
  9540	âWhat? Here? But why did they not blow up the bridge, if it was
  9541	mined?â
  9542	
  9543	âThat is what I ask you. No one, not even Bonaparte, knows why.â
  9544	
  9545	BolkÃ³nski shrugged his shoulders.
  9546	
  9547	âBut if the bridge is crossed it means that the army too is lost? It
  9548	will be cut off,â said he.
  9549	
  9550	âThatâs just it,â answered BilÃ­bin. âListen! The French entered
  9551	Vienna as I told you. Very well. Next day, which was yesterday, those
  9552	gentlemen, messieurs les marÃ©chaux, * Murat, Lannes, and Belliard,
  9553	mount and ride to the bridge. (Observe that all three are Gascons.)
  9554	âGentlemen,â says one of them, âyou know the Thabor Bridge is
  9555	mined and doubly mined and that there are menacing fortifications at its
  9556	head and an army of fifteen thousand men has been ordered to blow up
  9557	the bridge and not let us cross? But it will please our sovereign the
  9558	Emperor Napoleon if we take this bridge, so let us three go and take
  9559	it!â âYes, letâs!â say the others. And off they go and take the
  9560	bridge, cross it, and now with their whole army are on this side of the
  9561	Danube, marching on us, you, and your lines of communication.â
  9562	
  9563	    * The marshalls.
  9564	
  9565	âStop jesting,â said Prince Andrew sadly and seriously. This news
  9566	grieved him and yet he was pleased.
  9567	
  9568	As soon as he learned that the Russian army was in such a hopeless
  9569	situation it occurred to him that it was he who was destined to lead it
  9570	out of this position; that here was the Toulon that would lift him from
  9571	the ranks of obscure officers and offer him the first step to fame!
  9572	Listening to BilÃ­bin he was already imagining how on reaching the army
  9573	he would give an opinion at the war council which would be the only one
  9574	that could save the army, and how he alone would be entrusted with the
  9575	executing of the plan.
  9576	
  9577	âStop this jesting,â he said.
  9578	
  9579	âI am not jesting,â BilÃ­bin went on. âNothing is truer or sadder.
  9580	These gentlemen ride onto the bridge alone and wave white handkerchiefs;
  9581	they assure the officer on duty that they, the marshals, are on
  9582	their way to negotiate with Prince Auersperg. He lets them enter the
  9583	tÃªte-de-pont. * They spin him a thousand gasconades, saying that
  9584	the war is over, that the Emperor Francis is arranging a meeting with
  9585	Bonaparte, that they desire to see Prince Auersperg, and so on. The
  9586	officer sends for Auersperg; these gentlemen embrace the officers, crack
  9587	jokes, sit on the cannon, and meanwhile a French battalion gets to
  9588	the bridge unobserved, flings the bags of incendiary material into
  9589	the water, and approaches the tÃªte-de-pont. At length appears the
  9590	lieutenant general, our dear Prince Auersperg von Mautern himself.
  9591	âDearest foe! Flower of the Austrian army, hero of the Turkish wars!
  9592	Hostilities are ended, we can shake one anotherâs hand.... The
  9593	Emperor Napoleon burns with impatience to make Prince Auerspergâs
  9594	acquaintance.â In a word, those gentlemen, Gascons indeed, so
  9595	bewildered him with fine words, and he is so flattered by his rapidly
  9596	established intimacy with the French marshals, and so dazzled by the
  9597	sight of Muratâs mantle and ostrich plumes, quâil nây voit que du
  9598	feu, et oublie celui quâil devait faire faire sur lâennemi!â *(2)
  9599	In spite of the animation of his speech, BilÃ­bin did not forget to
  9600	pause after this mot to give time for its due appreciation. âThe
  9601	French battalion rushes to the bridgehead, spikes the guns, and the
  9602	bridge is taken! But what is best of all,â he went on, his excitement
  9603	subsiding under the delightful interest of his own story, âis that the
  9604	sergeant in charge of the cannon which was to give the signal to fire
  9605	the mines and blow up the bridge, this sergeant, seeing that the French
  9606	troops were running onto the bridge, was about to fire, but Lannes
  9607	stayed his hand. The sergeant, who was evidently wiser than his general,
  9608	goes up to Auersperg and says: âPrince, you are being deceived, here
  9609	are the French!â Murat, seeing that all is lost if the sergeant is
  9610	allowed to speak, turns to Auersperg with feigned astonishment (he is a
  9611	true Gascon) and says: âI donât recognize the world-famous Austrian
  9612	discipline, if you allow a subordinate to address you like that!â It
  9613	was a stroke of genius. Prince Auersperg feels his dignity at stake and
  9614	orders the sergeant to be arrested. Come, you must own that this affair
  9615	of the Thabor Bridge is delightful! It is not exactly stupidity, nor
  9616	rascality....â
  9617	
  9618	     * Bridgehead.
  9619	
  9620	     * (2) That their fire gets into his eyes and he forgets that
  9621	     he ought to be firing at the enemy.
  9622	
  9623	âIt may be treachery,â said Prince Andrew, vividly imagining the
  9624	gray overcoats, wounds, the smoke of gunpowder, the sounds of firing,
  9625	and the glory that awaited him.
  9626	
  9627	âNot that either. That puts the court in too bad a light,â replied
  9628	BilÃ­bin. âItâs not treachery nor rascality nor stupidity: it is
  9629	just as at Ulm... it is...ââhe seemed to be trying to find the right
  9630	expression. âCâest... câest du Mack. Nous sommes mackÃ©s (It is...
  9631	it is a bit of Mack. We are Macked),â he concluded, feeling that he
  9632	had produced a good epigram, a fresh one that would be repeated. His
  9633	hitherto puckered brow became smooth as a sign of pleasure, and with a
  9634	slight smile he began to examine his nails.
  9635	
  9636	âWhere are you off to?â he said suddenly to Prince Andrew who had
  9637	risen and was going toward his room.
  9638	
  9639	âI am going away.â
  9640	
  9641	âWhere to?â
  9642	
  9643	âTo the army.â
  9644	
  9645	âBut you meant to stay another two days?â
  9646	
  9647	âBut now I am off at once.â
  9648	
  9649	And Prince Andrew after giving directions about his departure went to
  9650	his room.
  9651	
  9652	âDo you know, mon cher,â said BilÃ­bin following him, âI have been
  9653	thinking about you. Why are you going?â
  9654	
  9655	And in proof of the conclusiveness of his opinion all the wrinkles
  9656	vanished from his face.
  9657	
  9658	Prince Andrew looked inquiringly at him and gave no reply.
  9659	
  9660	âWhy are you going? I know you think it your duty to gallop back to
  9661	the army now that it is in danger. I understand that. Mon cher, it is
  9662	heroism!â
  9663	
  9664	âNot at all,â said Prince Andrew.
  9665	
  9666	âBut as you are a philosopher, be a consistent one, look at the other
  9667	side of the question and you will see that your duty, on the contrary,
  9668	is to take care of yourself. Leave it to those who are no longer fit for
  9669	anything else.... You have not been ordered to return and have not been
  9670	dismissed from here; therefore, you can stay and go with us wherever our
  9671	ill luck takes us. They say we are going to OlmÃ¼tz, and OlmÃ¼tz is a
  9672	very decent town. You and I will travel comfortably in my calÃ¨che.â
  9673	
  9674	âDo stop joking, BilÃ­bin,â cried BolkÃ³nski.
  9675	
  9676	âI am speaking sincerely as a friend! Consider! Where and why are
  9677	you going, when you might remain here? You are faced by one of two
  9678	things,â and the skin over his left temple puckered, âeither you
  9679	will not reach your regiment before peace is concluded, or you will
  9680	share defeat and disgrace with KutÃºzovâs whole army.â
  9681	
  9682	And BilÃ­bin unwrinkled his temple, feeling that the dilemma was
  9683	insoluble.
  9684	
  9685	âI cannot argue about it,â replied Prince Andrew coldly, but he
  9686	thought: âI am going to save the army.â
  9687	
  9688	âMy dear fellow, you are a hero!â said BilÃ­bin.
  9689	
  9690	
  9691	
  9692	
  9693	
  9694	CHAPTER XIII
  9695	
  9696	That same night, having taken leave of the Minister of War, BolkÃ³nski
  9697	set off to rejoin the army, not knowing where he would find it and
  9698	fearing to be captured by the French on the way to Krems.
  9699	
  9700	In BrÃ¼nn everybody attached to the court was packing up, and the heavy
  9701	baggage was already being dispatched to OlmÃ¼tz. Near Hetzelsdorf Prince
  9702	Andrew struck the high road along which the Russian army was moving with
  9703	great haste and in the greatest disorder. The road was so obstructed
  9704	with carts that it was impossible to get by in a carriage. Prince Andrew
  9705	took a horse and a Cossack from a Cossack commander, and hungry and
  9706	weary, making his way past the baggage wagons, rode in search of the
  9707	commander in chief and of his own luggage. Very sinister reports of the
  9708	position of the army reached him as he went along, and the appearance of
  9709	the troops in their disorderly flight confirmed these rumors.
  9710	
  9711	âCette armÃ©e russe que lâor de lâAngleterre a transportÃ©e des
  9712	extrÃ©mitÃ©s de lâunivers, nous allons lui faire Ã©prouver le mÃªme
  9713	sortâ(le sort de lâarmÃ©e dâUlm).â * He remembered these words
  9714	in Bonaparteâs address to his army at the beginning of the campaign,
  9715	and they awoke in him astonishment at the genius of his hero, a feeling
  9716	of wounded pride, and a hope of glory. âAnd should there be nothing
  9717	left but to die?â he thought. âWell, if need be, I shall do it no
  9718	worse than others.â
  9719	
  9720	     * âThat Russian army which has been brought from the ends of
  9721	     the earth by English gold, we shall cause to share the same
  9722	     fateâ(the fate of the army at Ulm).â
  9723	
  9724	
  9725	He looked with disdain at the endless confused mass of detachments,
  9726	carts, guns, artillery, and again baggage wagons and vehicles of all
  9727	kinds overtaking one another and blocking the muddy road, three and
  9728	sometimes four abreast. From all sides, behind and before, as far as ear
  9729	could reach, there were the rattle of wheels, the creaking of carts
  9730	and gun carriages, the tramp of horses, the crack of whips, shouts, the
  9731	urging of horses, and the swearing of soldiers, orderlies, and officers.
  9732	All along the sides of the road fallen horses were to be seen, some
  9733	flayed, some not, and broken-down carts beside which solitary soldiers
  9734	sat waiting for something, and again soldiers straggling from their
  9735	companies, crowds of whom set off to the neighboring villages, or
  9736	returned from them dragging sheep, fowls, hay, and bulging sacks. At
  9737	each ascent or descent of the road the crowds were yet denser and the
  9738	din of shouting more incessant. Soldiers floundering knee-deep in mud
  9739	pushed the guns and wagons themselves. Whips cracked, hoofs slipped,
  9740	traces broke, and lungs were strained with shouting. The officers
  9741	directing the march rode backward and forward between the carts. Their
  9742	voices were but feebly heard amid the uproar and one saw by their faces
  9743	that they despaired of the possibility of checking this disorder.
  9744	
  9745	âHere is our dear Orthodox Russian army,â thought BolkÃ³nski,
  9746	recalling BilÃ­binâs words.
  9747	
  9748	Wishing to find out where the commander in chief was, he rode up to
  9749	a convoy. Directly opposite to him came a strange one-horse vehicle,
  9750	evidently rigged up by soldiers out of any available materials and
  9751	looking like something between a cart, a cabriolet, and a calÃ¨che.
  9752	A soldier was driving, and a woman enveloped in shawls sat behind the
  9753	apron under the leather hood of the vehicle. Prince Andrew rode up
  9754	and was just putting his question to a soldier when his attention
  9755	was diverted by the desperate shrieks of the woman in the vehicle. An
  9756	officer in charge of transport was beating the soldier who was driving
  9757	the womanâs vehicle for trying to get ahead of others, and the strokes
  9758	of his whip fell on the apron of the equipage. The woman screamed
  9759	piercingly. Seeing Prince Andrew she leaned out from behind the apron
  9760	and, waving her thin arms from under the woolen shawl, cried:
  9761	
  9762	âMr. Aide-de-camp! Mr. Aide-de-camp!... For heavenâs sake... Protect
  9763	me! What will become of us? I am the wife of the doctor of the Seventh
  9764	Chasseurs.... They wonât let us pass, we are left behind and have lost
  9765	our people...â
  9766	
  9767	âIâll flatten you into a pancake!â shouted the angry officer to
  9768	the soldier. âTurn back with your slut!â
  9769	
  9770	âMr. Aide-de-camp! Help me!... What does it all mean?â screamed the
  9771	doctorâs wife.
  9772	
  9773	âKindly let this cart pass. Donât you see itâs a woman?â said
  9774	Prince Andrew riding up to the officer.
  9775	
  9776	The officer glanced at him, and without replying turned again to the
  9777	soldier. âIâll teach you to push on!... Back!â
  9778	
  9779	âLet them pass, I tell you!â repeated Prince Andrew, compressing his
  9780	lips.
  9781	
  9782	âAnd who are you?â cried the officer, turning on him with tipsy
  9783	rage, âwho are you? Are you in command here? Eh? I am commander here,
  9784	not you! Go back or Iâll flatten you into a pancake,â repeated he.
  9785	This expression evidently pleased him.
  9786	
  9787	âThat was a nice snub for the little aide-de-camp,â came a voice
  9788	from behind.
  9789	
  9790	Prince Andrew saw that the officer was in that state of senseless,
  9791	tipsy rage when a man does not know what he is saying. He saw that his
  9792	championship of the doctorâs wife in her queer trap might expose him
  9793	to what he dreaded more than anything in the worldâto ridicule; but
  9794	his instinct urged him on. Before the officer finished his sentence
  9795	Prince Andrew, his face distorted with fury, rode up to him and raised
  9796	his riding whip.
  9797	
  9798	âKind...ly letâthemâpass!â
  9799	
  9800	The officer flourished his arm and hastily rode away.
  9801	
  9802	âItâs all the fault of these fellows on the staff that thereâs
  9803	this disorder,â he muttered. âDo as you like.â
  9804	
  9805	Prince Andrew without lifting his eyes rode hastily away from the
  9806	doctorâs wife, who was calling him her deliverer, and recalling with
  9807	a sense of disgust the minutest details of this humiliating scene he
  9808	galloped on to the village where he was told that the commander in chief
  9809	was.
  9810	
  9811	On reaching the village he dismounted and went to the nearest house,
  9812	intending to rest if but for a moment, eat something, and try to sort
  9813	out the stinging and tormenting thoughts that confused his mind. âThis
  9814	is a mob of scoundrels and not an army,â he was thinking as he went
  9815	up to the window of the first house, when a familiar voice called him by
  9816	name.
  9817	
  9818	He turned round. NesvÃ­tskiâs handsome face looked out of the little
  9819	window. NesvÃ­tski, moving his moist lips as he chewed something, and
  9820	flourishing his arm, called him to enter.
  9821	
  9822	âBolkÃ³nski! BolkÃ³nski!... Donât you hear? Eh? Come quick...â he
  9823	shouted.
  9824	
  9825	Entering the house, Prince Andrew saw NesvÃ­tski and another adjutant
  9826	having something to eat. They hastily turned round to him asking if he
  9827	had any news. On their familiar faces he read agitation and alarm.
  9828	This was particularly noticeable on NesvÃ­tskiâs usually laughing
  9829	countenance.
  9830	
  9831	âWhere is the commander in chief?â asked BolkÃ³nski.
  9832	
  9833	âHere, in that house,â answered the adjutant.
  9834	
  9835	âWell, is it true that itâs peace and capitulation?â asked
  9836	NesvÃ­tski.
  9837	
  9838	âI was going to ask you. I know nothing except that it was all I could
  9839	do to get here.â
  9840	
  9841	âAnd we, my dear boy! Itâs terrible! I was wrong to laugh at Mack,
  9842	weâre getting it still worse,â said NesvÃ­tski. âBut sit down and
  9843	have something to eat.â
  9844	
  9845	âYou wonât be able to find either your baggage or anything else now,
  9846	Prince. And God only knows where your man Peter is,â said the other
  9847	adjutant.
  9848	
  9849	âWhere are headquarters?â
  9850	
  9851	âWe are to spend the night in Znaim.â
  9852	
  9853	âWell, I have got all I need into packs for two horses,â said
  9854	NesvÃ­tski. âTheyâve made up splendid packs for meâfit to cross
  9855	the Bohemian mountains with. Itâs a bad lookout, old fellow! But
  9856	whatâs the matter with you? You must be ill to shiver like that,â he
  9857	added, noticing that Prince Andrew winced as at an electric shock.
  9858	
  9859	âItâs nothing,â replied Prince Andrew.
  9860	
  9861	He had just remembered his recent encounter with the doctorâs wife and
  9862	the convoy officer.
  9863	
  9864	âWhat is the commander in chief doing here?â he asked.
  9865	
  9866	âI canât make out at all,â said NesvÃ­tski.
  9867	
  9868	âWell, all I can make out is that everything is abominable,
  9869	abominable, quite abominable!â said Prince Andrew, and he went off to
  9870	the house where the commander in chief was.
  9871	
  9872	Passing by KutÃºzovâs carriage and the exhausted saddle horses of
  9873	his suite, with their Cossacks who were talking loudly together, Prince
  9874	Andrew entered the passage. KutÃºzov himself, he was told, was in the
  9875	house with Prince BagratiÃ³n and Weyrother. Weyrother was the Austrian
  9876	general who had succeeded Schmidt. In the passage little KozlÃ³vski was
  9877	squatting on his heels in front of a clerk. The clerk, with cuffs turned
  9878	up, was hastily writing at a tub turned bottom upwards. KozlÃ³vskiâs
  9879	face looked wornâhe too had evidently not slept all night. He glanced
  9880	at Prince Andrew and did not even nod to him.
  9881	
  9882	âSecond line... have you written it?â he continued dictating to the
  9883	clerk. âThe Kiev Grenadiers, Podolian...â
  9884	
  9885	âOne canât write so fast, your honor,â said the clerk, glancing
  9886	angrily and disrespectfully at KozlÃ³vski.
  9887	
  9888	Through the door came the sounds of KutÃºzovâs voice, excited and
  9889	dissatisfied, interrupted by another, an unfamiliar voice. From the
  9890	sound of these voices, the inattentive way KozlÃ³vski looked at him, the
  9891	disrespectful manner of the exhausted clerk, the fact that the clerk and
  9892	KozlÃ³vski were squatting on the floor by a tub so near to the commander
  9893	in chief, and from the noisy laughter of the Cossacks holding the
  9894	horses near the window, Prince Andrew felt that something important and
  9895	disastrous was about to happen.
  9896	
  9897	He turned to KozlÃ³vski with urgent questions.
  9898	
  9899	âImmediately, Prince,â said KozlÃ³vski. âDispositions for
  9900	BagratiÃ³n.â
  9901	
  9902	âWhat about capitulation?â
  9903	
  9904	âNothing of the sort. Orders are issued for a battle.â
  9905	
  9906	Prince Andrew moved toward the door from whence voices were heard.
  9907	Just as he was going to open it the sounds ceased, the door opened, and
  9908	KutÃºzov with his eagle nose and puffy face appeared in the doorway.
  9909	Prince Andrew stood right in front of KutÃºzov but the expression of
  9910	the commander in chiefâs one sound eye showed him to be so preoccupied
  9911	with thoughts and anxieties as to be oblivious of his presence. He
  9912	looked straight at his adjutantâs face without recognizing him.
  9913	
  9914	âWell, have you finished?â said he to KozlÃ³vski.
  9915	
  9916	âOne moment, your excellency.â
  9917	
  9918	BagratiÃ³n, a gaunt middle-aged man of medium height with a firm,
  9919	impassive face of Oriental type, came out after the commander in chief.
  9920	
  9921	âI have the honor to present myself,â repeated Prince Andrew rather
  9922	loudly, handing KutÃºzov an envelope.
  9923	
  9924	âAh, from Vienna? Very good. Later, later!â
  9925	
  9926	KutÃºzov went out into the porch with BagratiÃ³n.
  9927	
  9928	âWell, good-by, Prince,â said he to BagratiÃ³n. âMy blessing, and
  9929	may Christ be with you in your great endeavor!â
  9930	
  9931	His face suddenly softened and tears came into his eyes. With his left
  9932	hand he drew BagratiÃ³n toward him, and with his right, on which he wore
  9933	a ring, he made the sign of the cross over him with a gesture evidently
  9934	habitual, offering his puffy cheek, but BagratiÃ³n kissed him on the
  9935	neck instead.
  9936	
  9937	âChrist be with you!â KutÃºzov repeated and went toward his
  9938	carriage. âGet in with me,â said he to BolkÃ³nski.
  9939	
  9940	âYour excellency, I should like to be of use here. Allow me to remain
  9941	with Prince BagratiÃ³nâs detachment.â
  9942	
  9943	âGet in,â said KutÃºzov, and noticing that BolkÃ³nski still delayed,
  9944	he added: âI need good officers myself, need them myself!â
  9945	
  9946	They got into the carriage and drove for a few minutes in silence.
  9947	
  9948	âThere is still much, much before us,â he said, as if with an old
  9949	manâs penetration he understood all that was passing in BolkÃ³nskiâs
  9950	mind. âIf a tenth part of his detachment returns I shall thank God,â
  9951	he added as if speaking to himself.
  9952	
  9953	Prince Andrew glanced at KutÃºzovâs face only a foot distant from him
  9954	and involuntarily noticed the carefully washed seams of the scar near
  9955	his temple, where an Ismail bullet had pierced his skull, and the empty
  9956	eye socket. âYes, he has a right to speak so calmly of those menâs
  9957	death,â thought BolkÃ³nski.
  9958	
  9959	âThat is why I beg to be sent to that detachment,â he said.
  9960	
  9961	KutÃºzov did not reply. He seemed to have forgotten what he had been
  9962	saying, and sat plunged in thought. Five minutes later, gently swaying
  9963	on the soft springs of the carriage, he turned to Prince Andrew.
  9964	There was not a trace of agitation on his face. With delicate irony he
  9965	questioned Prince Andrew about the details of his interview with the
  9966	Emperor, about the remarks he had heard at court concerning the Krems
  9967	affair, and about some ladies they both knew.
  9968	
  9969	
  9970	
  9971	
  9972	
  9973	CHAPTER XIV
  9974	
  9975	On November 1 KutÃºzov had received, through a spy, news that the army
  9976	he commanded was in an almost hopeless position. The spy reported that
  9977	the French, after crossing the bridge at Vienna, were advancing in
  9978	immense force upon KutÃºzovâs line of communication with the troops
  9979	that were arriving from Russia. If KutÃºzov decided to remain at Krems,
  9980	Napoleonâs army of one hundred and fifty thousand men would cut him
  9981	off completely and surround his exhausted army of forty thousand, and he
  9982	would find himself in the position of Mack at Ulm. If KutÃºzov decided
  9983	to abandon the road connecting him with the troops arriving from Russia,
  9984	he would have to march with no road into unknown parts of the Bohemian
  9985	mountains, defending himself against superior forces of the enemy and
  9986	abandoning all hope of a junction with BuxhÃ¶wden. If KutÃºzov decided
  9987	to retreat along the road from Krems to OlmÃ¼tz, to unite with the
  9988	troops arriving from Russia, he risked being forestalled on that road
  9989	by the French who had crossed the Vienna bridge, and encumbered by his
  9990	baggage and transport, having to accept battle on the march against an
  9991	enemy three times as strong, who would hem him in from two sides.
  9992	
  9993	KutÃºzov chose this latter course.
  9994	
  9995	The French, the spy reported, having crossed the Vienna bridge, were
  9996	advancing by forced marches toward Znaim, which lay sixty-six miles
  9997	off on the line of KutÃºzovâs retreat. If he reached Znaim before the
  9998	French, there would be great hope of saving the army; to let the
  9999	French forestall him at Znaim meant the exposure of his whole army to a
 10000	disgrace such as that of Ulm, or to utter destruction. But to forestall
 10001	the French with his whole army was impossible. The road for the French
 10002	from Vienna to Znaim was shorter and better than the road for the
 10003	Russians from Krems to Znaim.
 10004	
 10005	The night he received the news, KutÃºzov sent BagratiÃ³nâs vanguard,
 10006	four thousand strong, to the right across the hills from the Krems-Znaim
 10007	to the Vienna-Znaim road. BagratiÃ³n was to make this march without
 10008	resting, and to halt facing Vienna with Znaim to his rear, and if he
 10009	succeeded in forestalling the French he was to delay them as long as
 10010	possible. KutÃºzov himself with all his transport took the road to
 10011	Znaim.
 10012	
 10013	Marching thirty miles that stormy night across roadless hills, with his
 10014	hungry, ill-shod soldiers, and losing a third of his men as stragglers
 10015	by the way, BagratiÃ³n came out on the Vienna-Znaim road at HollabrÃ¼nn
 10016	a few hours ahead of the French who were approaching HollabrÃ¼nn from
 10017	Vienna. KutÃºzov with his transport had still to march for some days
 10018	before he could reach Znaim. Hence BagratiÃ³n with his four thousand
 10019	hungry, exhausted men would have to detain for days the whole enemy army
 10020	that came upon him at HollabrÃ¼nn, which was clearly impossible. But
 10021	a freak of fate made the impossible possible. The success of the trick
 10022	that had placed the Vienna bridge in the hands of the French without
 10023	a fight led Murat to try to deceive KutÃºzov in a similar way. Meeting
 10024	BagratiÃ³nâs weak detachment on the Znaim road he supposed it to be
 10025	KutÃºzovâs whole army. To be able to crush it absolutely he awaited
 10026	the arrival of the rest of the troops who were on their way from Vienna,
 10027	and with this object offered a three daysâ truce on condition that
 10028	both armies should remain in position without moving. Murat declared
 10029	that negotiations for peace were already proceeding, and that he
 10030	therefore offered this truce to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. Count
 10031	Nostitz, the Austrian general occupying the advanced posts, believed
 10032	Muratâs emissary and retired, leaving BagratiÃ³nâs division
 10033	exposed. Another emissary rode to the Russian line to announce the peace
 10034	negotiations and to offer the Russian army the three daysâ truce.
 10035	BagratiÃ³n replied that he was not authorized either to accept or refuse
 10036	a truce and sent his adjutant to KutÃºzov to report the offer he had
 10037	received.
 10038	
 10039	A truce was KutÃºzovâs sole chance of gaining time, giving
 10040	BagratiÃ³nâs exhausted troops some rest, and letting the transport and
 10041	heavy convoys (whose movements were concealed from the French) advance
 10042	if but one stage nearer Znaim. The offer of a truce gave the only, and
 10043	a quite unexpected, chance of saving the army. On receiving the news
 10044	he immediately dispatched Adjutant General Wintzingerode, who was in
 10045	attendance on him, to the enemy camp. Wintzingerode was not merely
 10046	to agree to the truce but also to offer terms of capitulation, and
 10047	meanwhile KutÃºzov sent his adjutants back to hasten to the utmost the
 10048	movements of the baggage trains of the entire army along the Krems-Znaim
 10049	road. BagratiÃ³nâs exhausted and hungry detachment, which alone
 10050	covered this movement of the transport and of the whole army, had to
 10051	remain stationary in face of an enemy eight times as strong as itself.
 10052	
 10053	KutÃºzovâs expectations that the proposals of capitulation (which were
 10054	in no way binding) might give time for part of the transport to pass,
 10055	and also that Muratâs mistake would very soon be discovered, proved
 10056	correct. As soon as Bonaparte (who was at SchÃ¶nbrunn, sixteen miles
 10057	from HollabrÃ¼nn) received Muratâs dispatch with the proposal of a
 10058	truce and a capitulation, he detected a ruse and wrote the following
 10059	letter to Murat:
 10060	
 10061	SchÃ¶nbrunn, 25th Brumaire, 1805,
 10062	
 10063	at eight oâclock in the morning
 10064	
 10065	To PRINCE MURAT,
 10066	
 10067	I cannot find words to express to you my displeasure. You command only
 10068	my advance guard, and have no right to arrange an armistice without my
 10069	order. You are causing me to lose the fruits of a campaign. Break
 10070	the armistice immediately and march on the enemy. Inform him that the
 10071	general who signed that capitulation had no right to do so, and that no
 10072	one but the Emperor of Russia has that right.
 10073	
 10074	If, however, the Emperor of Russia ratifies that convention, I will
 10075	ratify it; but it is only a trick. March on, destroy the Russian
 10076	army.... You are in a position to seize its baggage and artillery.
 10077	
 10078	The Russian Emperorâs aide-de-camp is an impostor. Officers are
 10079	nothing when they have no powers; this one had none.... The Austrians
 10080	let themselves be tricked at the crossing of the Vienna bridge, you are
 10081	letting yourself be tricked by an aide-de-camp of the Emperor.
 10082	
 10083	NAPOLEON
 10084	
 10085	Bonaparteâs adjutant rode full gallop with this menacing letter to
 10086	Murat. Bonaparte himself, not trusting to his generals, moved with all
 10087	the Guards to the field of battle, afraid of letting a ready victim
 10088	escape, and BagratiÃ³nâs four thousand men merrily lighted campfires,
 10089	dried and warmed themselves, cooked their porridge for the first time
 10090	for three days, and not one of them knew or imagined what was in store
 10091	for him.
 10092	
 10093	
 10094	
 10095	
 10096	
 10097	CHAPTER XV
 10098	
 10099	Between three and four oâclock in the afternoon Prince Andrew, who
 10100	had persisted in his request to KutÃºzov, arrived at Grunth and reported
 10101	himself to BagratiÃ³n. Bonaparteâs adjutant had not yet reached
 10102	Muratâs detachment and the battle had not yet begun. In BagratiÃ³nâs
 10103	detachment no one knew anything of the general position of affairs. They
 10104	talked of peace but did not believe in its possibility; others talked
 10105	of a battle but also disbelieved in the nearness of an engagement.
 10106	BagratiÃ³n, knowing BolkÃ³nski to be a favorite and trusted adjutant,
 10107	received him with distinction and special marks of favor, explaining to
 10108	him that there would probably be an engagement that day or the next, and
 10109	giving him full liberty to remain with him during the battle or to join
 10110	the rearguard and have an eye on the order of retreat, âwhich is also
 10111	very important.â
 10112	
 10113	âHowever, there will hardly be an engagement today,â said BagratiÃ³n
 10114	as if to reassure Prince Andrew.
 10115	
 10116	âIf he is one of the ordinary little staff dandies sent to earn a
 10117	medal he can get his reward just as well in the rearguard, but if he
 10118	wishes to stay with me, let him... heâll be of use here if heâs a
 10119	brave officer,â thought BagratiÃ³n. Prince Andrew, without replying,
 10120	asked the princeâs permission to ride round the position to see the
 10121	disposition of the forces, so as to know his bearings should he be sent
 10122	to execute an order. The officer on duty, a handsome, elegantly dressed
 10123	man with a diamond ring on his forefinger, who was fond of speaking
 10124	French though he spoke it badly, offered to conduct Prince Andrew.
 10125	
 10126	On all sides they saw rain-soaked officers with dejected faces who
 10127	seemed to be seeking something, and soldiers dragging doors, benches,
 10128	and fencing from the village.
 10129	
 10130	âThere now, Prince! We canât stop those fellows,â said the staff
 10131	officer pointing to the soldiers. âThe officers donât keep them in
 10132	hand. And there,â he pointed to a sutlerâs tent, âthey crowd in
 10133	and sit. This morning I turned them all out and now look, itâs full
 10134	again. I must go there, Prince, and scare them a bit. It wonât take a
 10135	moment.â
 10136	
 10137	âYes, letâs go in and I will get myself a roll and some cheese,â
 10138	said Prince Andrew who had not yet had time to eat anything.
 10139	
 10140	âWhy didnât you mention it, Prince? I would have offered you
 10141	something.â
 10142	
 10143	They dismounted and entered the tent. Several officers, with flushed and
 10144	weary faces, were sitting at the table eating and drinking.
 10145	
 10146	âNow what does this mean, gentlemen?â said the staff officer, in
 10147	the reproachful tone of a man who has repeated the same thing more
 10148	than once. âYou know it wonât do to leave your posts like this.
 10149	The prince gave orders that no one should leave his post. Now you,
 10150	Captain,â and he turned to a thin, dirty little artillery officer who
 10151	without his boots (he had given them to the canteen keeper to dry),
 10152	in only his stockings, rose when they entered, smiling not altogether
 10153	comfortably.
 10154	
 10155	âWell, arenât you ashamed of yourself, Captain TÃºshin?â he
 10156	continued. âOne would think that as an artillery officer you would set
 10157	a good example, yet here you are without your boots! The alarm will be
 10158	sounded and youâll be in a pretty position without your boots!â (The
 10159	staff officer smiled.) âKindly return to your posts, gentlemen, all of
 10160	you, all!â he added in a tone of command.
 10161	
 10162	Prince Andrew smiled involuntarily as he looked at the artillery officer
 10163	TÃºshin, who silent and smiling, shifting from one stockinged foot to
 10164	the other, glanced inquiringly with his large, intelligent, kindly eyes
 10165	from Prince Andrew to the staff officer.
 10166	
 10167	âThe soldiers say it feels easier without boots,â said Captain
 10168	TÃºshin smiling shyly in his uncomfortable position, evidently wishing
 10169	to adopt a jocular tone. But before he had finished he felt that his
 10170	jest was unacceptable and had not come off. He grew confused.
 10171	
 10172	âKindly return to your posts,â said the staff officer trying to
 10173	preserve his gravity.
 10174	
 10175	Prince Andrew glanced again at the artillery officerâs small figure.
 10176	There was something peculiar about it, quite unsoldierly, rather comic,
 10177	but extremely attractive.
 10178	
 10179	The staff officer and Prince Andrew mounted their horses and rode on.
 10180	
 10181	Having ridden beyond the village, continually meeting and overtaking
 10182	soldiers and officers of various regiments, they saw on their left some
 10183	entrenchments being thrown up, the freshly dug clay of which showed up
 10184	red. Several battalions of soldiers, in their shirt sleeves despite
 10185	the cold wind, swarmed in these earthworks like a host of white ants;
 10186	spadefuls of red clay were continually being thrown up from behind the
 10187	bank by unseen hands. Prince Andrew and the officer rode up, looked at
 10188	the entrenchment, and went on again. Just behind it they came upon some
 10189	dozens of soldiers, continually replaced by others, who ran from the
 10190	entrenchment. They had to hold their noses and put their horses to a
 10191	trot to escape from the poisoned atmosphere of these latrines.
 10192	
 10193	âVoilÃ  lâagrÃ©ment des camps, monsieur le prince,â * said the
 10194	staff officer.
 10195	
 10196	    * âThis is a pleasure one gets in camp, Prince.â
 10197	
 10198	
 10199	They rode up the opposite hill. From there the French could already be
 10200	seen. Prince Andrew stopped and began examining the position.
 10201	
 10202	âThatâs our battery,â said the staff officer indicating the
 10203	highest point. âItâs in charge of the queer fellow we saw without
 10204	his boots. You can see everything from there; letâs go there,
 10205	Prince.â
 10206	
 10207	âThank you very much, I will go on alone,â said Prince Andrew,
 10208	wishing to rid himself of this staff officerâs company, âplease
 10209	donât trouble yourself further.â
 10210	
 10211	The staff officer remained behind and Prince Andrew rode on alone.
 10212	
 10213	The farther forward and nearer the enemy he went, the more orderly and
 10214	cheerful were the troops. The greatest disorder and depression had been
 10215	in the baggage train he had passed that morning on the Znaim road seven
 10216	miles away from the French. At Grunth also some apprehension and alarm
 10217	could be felt, but the nearer Prince Andrew came to the French lines the
 10218	more confident was the appearance of our troops. The soldiers in
 10219	their greatcoats were ranged in lines, the sergeants major and company
 10220	officers were counting the men, poking the last man in each section in
 10221	the ribs and telling him to hold his hand up. Soldiers scattered over
 10222	the whole place were dragging logs and brushwood and were building
 10223	shelters with merry chatter and laughter; around the fires sat others,
 10224	dressed and undressed, drying their shirts and leg bands or mending
 10225	boots or overcoats and crowding round the boilers and porridge cookers.
 10226	In one company dinner was ready, and the soldiers were gazing eagerly
 10227	at the steaming boiler, waiting till the sample, which a quartermaster
 10228	sergeant was carrying in a wooden bowl to an officer who sat on a log
 10229	before his shelter, had been tasted.
 10230	
 10231	Another company, a lucky one for not all the companies had vodka,
 10232	crowded round a pockmarked, broad-shouldered sergeant major who, tilting
 10233	a keg, filled one after another the canteen lids held out to him. The
 10234	soldiers lifted the canteen lids to their lips with reverential faces,
 10235	emptied them, rolling the vodka in their mouths, and walked away from
 10236	the sergeant major with brightened expressions, licking their lips and
 10237	wiping them on the sleeves of their greatcoats. All their faces were
 10238	as serene as if all this were happening at home awaiting peaceful
 10239	encampment, and not within sight of the enemy before an action in
 10240	which at least half of them would be left on the field. After passing a
 10241	chasseur regiment and in the lines of the Kiev grenadiersâfine fellows
 10242	busy with similar peaceful affairsânear the shelter of the regimental
 10243	commander, higher than and different from the others, Prince Andrew came
 10244	out in front of a platoon of grenadiers before whom lay a naked man. Two
 10245	soldiers held him while two others were flourishing their switches and
 10246	striking him regularly on his bare back. The man shrieked unnaturally.
 10247	A stout major was pacing up and down the line, and regardless of the
 10248	screams kept repeating:
 10249	
 10250	âItâs a shame for a soldier to steal; a soldier must be honest,
 10251	honorable, and brave, but if he robs his fellows there is no honor in
 10252	him, heâs a scoundrel. Go on! Go on!â
 10253	
 10254	So the swishing sound of the strokes, and the desperate but unnatural
 10255	screams, continued.
 10256	
 10257	âGo on, go on!â said the major.
 10258	
 10259	A young officer with a bewildered and pained expression on his face
 10260	stepped away from the man and looked round inquiringly at the adjutant
 10261	as he rode by.
 10262	
 10263	Prince Andrew, having reached the front line, rode along it. Our front
 10264	line and that of the enemy were far apart on the right and left flanks,
 10265	but in the center where the men with a flag of truce had passed that
 10266	morning, the lines were so near together that the men could see one
 10267	anotherâs faces and speak to one another. Besides the soldiers who
 10268	formed the picket line on either side, there were many curious onlookers
 10269	who, jesting and laughing, stared at their strange foreign enemies.
 10270	
 10271	Since early morningâdespite an injunction not to approach the picket
 10272	lineâthe officers had been unable to keep sight-seers away. The
 10273	soldiers forming the picket line, like showmen exhibiting a curiosity,
 10274	no longer looked at the French but paid attention to the sight-seers and
 10275	grew weary waiting to be relieved. Prince Andrew halted to have a look
 10276	at the French.
 10277	
 10278	âLook! Look there!â one soldier was saying to another, pointing to a
 10279	Russian musketeer who had gone up to the picket line with an officer and
 10280	was rapidly and excitedly talking to a French grenadier. âHark to him
 10281	jabbering! Fine, isnât it? Itâs all the Frenchy can do to keep up
 10282	with him. There now, SÃ­dorov!â
 10283	
 10284	âWait a bit and listen. Itâs fine!â answered SÃ­dorov, who was
 10285	considered an adept at French.
 10286	
 10287	The soldier to whom the laughers referred was DÃ³lokhov. Prince Andrew
 10288	recognized him and stopped to listen to what he was saying. DÃ³lokhov
 10289	had come from the left flank where their regiment was stationed, with
 10290	his captain.
 10291	
 10292	âNow then, go on, go on!â incited the officer, bending forward and
 10293	trying not to lose a word of the speech which was incomprehensible to
 10294	him. âMore, please: more! Whatâs he saying?â
 10295	
 10296	DÃ³lokhov did not answer the captain; he had been drawn into a hot
 10297	dispute with the French grenadier. They were naturally talking about the
 10298	campaign. The Frenchman, confusing the Austrians with the Russians, was
 10299	trying to prove that the Russians had surrendered and had fled all
 10300	the way from Ulm, while DÃ³lokhov maintained that the Russians had not
 10301	surrendered but had beaten the French.
 10302	
 10303	âWe have orders to drive you off here, and we shall drive you off,â
 10304	said DÃ³lokhov.
 10305	
 10306	âOnly take care you and your Cossacks are not all captured!â said
 10307	the French grenadier.
 10308	
 10309	The French onlookers and listeners laughed.
 10310	
 10311	âWeâll make you dance as we did under SuvÃ³rov...,â * said
 10312	DÃ³lokhov.
 10313	
 10314	    * âOn vous fera danser.â
 10315	
 10316	
 10317	âQuâ est-ce quâil chante?â * asked a Frenchman.
 10318	
 10319	    * âWhatâs he singing about?â
 10320	
 10321	
 10322	âItâs ancient history,â said another, guessing that it referred to
 10323	a former war. âThe Emperor will teach your Suvara as he has taught the
 10324	others...â
 10325	
 10326	âBonaparte...â began DÃ³lokhov, but the Frenchman interrupted him.
 10327	
 10328	âNot Bonaparte. He is the Emperor! SacrÃ© nom...!â cried he angrily.
 10329	
 10330	âThe devil skin your Emperor.â
 10331	
 10332	And DÃ³lokhov swore at him in coarse soldierâs Russian and shouldering
 10333	his musket walked away.
 10334	
 10335	âLet us go, IvÃ¡n LukÃ­ch,â he said to the captain.
 10336	
 10337	âAh, thatâs the way to talk French,â said the picket soldiers.
 10338	âNow, SÃ­dorov, you have a try!â
 10339	
 10340	SÃ­dorov, turning to the French, winked, and began to jabber meaningless
 10341	sounds very fast: âKari, mala, tafa, safi, muter, KaskÃ¡,â he said,
 10342	trying to give an expressive intonation to his voice.
 10343	
 10344	âHo! ho! ho! Ha! ha! ha! ha! Ouh! ouh!â came peals of such healthy
 10345	and good-humored laughter from the soldiers that it infected the French
 10346	involuntarily, so much so that the only thing left to do seemed to be
 10347	to unload the muskets, explode the ammunition, and all return home as
 10348	quickly as possible.
 10349	
 10350	But the guns remained loaded, the loopholes in blockhouses and
 10351	entrenchments looked out just as menacingly, and the unlimbered cannon
 10352	confronted one another as before.
 10353	
 10354	
 10355	
 10356	
 10357	
 10358	CHAPTER XVI
 10359	
 10360	Having ridden round the whole line from right flank to left, Prince
 10361	Andrew made his way up to the battery from which the staff officer had
 10362	told him the whole field could be seen. Here he dismounted, and stopped
 10363	beside the farthest of the four unlimbered cannon. Before the guns an
 10364	artillery sentry was pacing up and down; he stood at attention when the
 10365	officer arrived, but at a sign resumed his measured, monotonous pacing.
 10366	Behind the guns were their limbers and still farther back picket ropes
 10367	and artillerymenâs bonfires. To the left, not far from the farthest
 10368	cannon, was a small, newly constructed wattle shed from which came the
 10369	sound of officersâ voices in eager conversation.
 10370	
 10371	It was true that a view over nearly the whole Russian position and the
 10372	greater part of the enemyâs opened out from this battery. Just facing
 10373	it, on the crest of the opposite hill, the village of SchÃ¶n Grabern
 10374	could be seen, and in three places to left and right the French troops
 10375	amid the smoke of their campfires, the greater part of whom were
 10376	evidently in the village itself and behind the hill. To the left from
 10377	that village, amid the smoke, was something resembling a battery, but it
 10378	was impossible to see it clearly with the naked eye. Our right flank was
 10379	posted on a rather steep incline which dominated the French position.
 10380	Our infantry were stationed there, and at the farthest point the
 10381	dragoons. In the center, where TÃºshinâs battery stood and from which
 10382	Prince Andrew was surveying the position, was the easiest and most
 10383	direct descent and ascent to the brook separating us from SchÃ¶n
 10384	Grabern. On the left our troops were close to a copse, in which smoked
 10385	the bonfires of our infantry who were felling wood. The French line was
 10386	wider than ours, and it was plain that they could easily outflank us
 10387	on both sides. Behind our position was a steep and deep dip, making it
 10388	difficult for artillery and cavalry to retire. Prince Andrew took
 10389	out his notebook and, leaning on the cannon, sketched a plan of the
 10390	position. He made some notes on two points, intending to mention them to
 10391	BagratiÃ³n. His idea was, first, to concentrate all the artillery in the
 10392	center, and secondly, to withdraw the cavalry to the other side of the
 10393	dip. Prince Andrew, being always near the commander in chief, closely
 10394	following the mass movements and general orders, and constantly studying
 10395	historical accounts of battles, involuntarily pictured to himself the
 10396	course of events in the forthcoming action in broad outline. He
 10397	imagined only important possibilities: âIf the enemy attacks the right
 10398	flank,â he said to himself, âthe Kiev grenadiers and the PodÃ³lsk
 10399	chasseurs must hold their position till reserves from the center
 10400	come up. In that case the dragoons could successfully make a flank
 10401	counterattack. If they attack our center we, having the center battery
 10402	on this high ground, shall withdraw the left flank under its cover, and
 10403	retreat to the dip by echelons.â So he reasoned.... All the time
 10404	he had been beside the gun, he had heard the voices of the officers
 10405	distinctly, but as often happens had not understood a word of what they
 10406	were saying. Suddenly, however, he was struck by a voice coming from the
 10407	shed, and its tone was so sincere that he could not but listen.
 10408	
 10409	âNo, friend,â said a pleasant and, as it seemed to Prince Andrew, a
 10410	familiar voice, âwhat I say is that if it were possible to know
 10411	what is beyond death, none of us would be afraid of it. Thatâs so,
 10412	friend.â
 10413	
 10414	Another, a younger voice, interrupted him: âAfraid or not, you canât
 10415	escape it anyhow.â
 10416	
 10417	âAll the same, one is afraid! Oh, you clever people,â said a third
 10418	manly voice interrupting them both. âOf course you artillery men are
 10419	very wise, because you can take everything along with youâvodka and
 10420	snacks.â
 10421	
 10422	And the owner of the manly voice, evidently an infantry officer,
 10423	laughed.
 10424	
 10425	âYes, one is afraid,â continued the first speaker, he of the
 10426	familiar voice. âOne is afraid of the unknown, thatâs what it is.
 10427	Whatever we may say about the soul going to the sky... we know there is
 10428	no sky but only an atmosphere.â
 10429	
 10430	The manly voice again interrupted the artillery officer.
 10431	
 10432	âWell, stand us some of your herb vodka, TÃºshin,â it said.
 10433	
 10434	âWhy,â thought Prince Andrew, âthatâs the captain who stood up
 10435	in the sutlerâs hut without his boots.â He recognized the agreeable,
 10436	philosophizing voice with pleasure.
 10437	
 10438	âSome herb vodka? Certainly!â said TÃºshin. âBut still, to
 10439	conceive a future life...â
 10440	
 10441	He did not finish. Just then there was a whistle in the air; nearer and
 10442	nearer, faster and louder, louder and faster, a cannon ball, as if it
 10443	had not finished saying what was necessary, thudded into the ground near
 10444	the shed with super human force, throwing up a mass of earth. The ground
 10445	seemed to groan at the terrible impact.
 10446	
 10447	And immediately TÃºshin, with a short pipe in the corner of his mouth
 10448	and his kind, intelligent face rather pale, rushed out of the shed
 10449	followed by the owner of the manly voice, a dashing infantry officer who
 10450	hurried off to his company, buttoning up his coat as he ran.

 10456	CHAPTER XVII
 10457	
 10458	Mounting his horse again Prince Andrew lingered with the battery,
 10459	looking at the puff from the gun that had sent the ball. His eyes
 10460	ran rapidly over the wide space, but he only saw that the hitherto
 10461	motionless masses of the French now swayed and that there really was
 10462	a battery to their left. The smoke above it had not yet dispersed. Two
 10463	mounted Frenchmen, probably adjutants, were galloping up the hill. A
 10464	small but distinctly visible enemy column was moving down the hill,
 10465	probably to strengthen the front line. The smoke of the first shot had
 10466	not yet dispersed before another puff appeared, followed by a report.
 10467	The battle had begun! Prince Andrew turned his horse and galloped back
 10468	to Grunth to find Prince BagratiÃ³n. He heard the cannonade behind him
 10469	growing louder and more frequent. Evidently our guns had begun to reply.
 10470	From the bottom of the slope, where the parleys had taken place, came
 10471	the report of musketry.
 10472	
 10473	Lemarrois had just arrived at a gallop with Bonaparteâs stern letter,
 10474	and Murat, humiliated and anxious to expiate his fault, had at once
 10475	moved his forces to attack the center and outflank both the Russian
 10476	wings, hoping before evening and before the arrival of the Emperor to
 10477	crush the contemptible detachment that stood before him.
 10478	
 10479	âIt has begun. Here it is!â thought Prince Andrew, feeling the
 10480	blood rush to his heart. âBut where and how will my Toulon present
 10481	itself?â
 10482	
 10483	Passing between the companies that had been eating porridge and drinking
 10484	vodka a quarter of an hour before, he saw everywhere the same rapid
 10485	movement of soldiers forming ranks and getting their muskets ready,
 10486	and on all their faces he recognized the same eagerness that filled his
 10487	heart. âIt has begun! Here it is, dreadful but enjoyable!â was what
 10488	the face of each soldier and each officer seemed to say.
 10489	
 10490	Before he had reached the embankments that were being thrown up, he saw,
 10491	in the light of the dull autumn evening, mounted men coming toward him.
 10492	The foremost, wearing a Cossack cloak and lambskin cap and riding a
 10493	white horse, was Prince BagratiÃ³n. Prince Andrew stopped, waiting for
 10494	him to come up; Prince BagratiÃ³n reined in his horse and recognizing
 10495	Prince Andrew nodded to him. He still looked ahead while Prince Andrew
 10496	told him what he had seen.
 10497	
 10498	The feeling, âIt has begun! Here it is!â was seen even on Prince
 10499	BagratiÃ³nâs hard brown face with its half-closed, dull, sleepy eyes.
 10500	Prince Andrew gazed with anxious curiosity at that impassive face
 10501	and wished he could tell what, if anything, this man was thinking
 10502	and feeling at that moment. âIs there anything at all behind that
 10503	impassive face?â Prince Andrew asked himself as he looked. Prince
 10504	BagratiÃ³n bent his head in sign of agreement with what Prince Andrew
 10505	told him, and said, âVery good!â in a tone that seemed to imply that
 10506	everything that took place and was reported to him was exactly what he
 10507	had foreseen. Prince Andrew, out of breath with his rapid ride, spoke
 10508	quickly. Prince BagratiÃ³n, uttering his words with an Oriental accent,
 10509	spoke particularly slowly, as if to impress the fact that there was no
 10510	need to hurry. However, he put his horse to a trot in the direction
 10511	of TÃºshinâs battery. Prince Andrew followed with the suite. Behind
 10512	Prince BagratiÃ³n rode an officer of the suite, the princeâs personal
 10513	adjutant, ZherkÃ³v, an orderly officer, the staff officer on duty,
 10514	riding a fine bobtailed horse, and a civilianâan accountant who had
 10515	asked permission to be present at the battle out of curiosity. The
 10516	accountant, a stout, full-faced man, looked around him with a naÃ¯ve
 10517	smile of satisfaction and presented a strange appearance among the
 10518	hussars, Cossacks, and adjutants, in his camlet coat, as he jolted on
 10519	his horse with a convoy officerâs saddle.
 10520	
 10521	âHe wants to see a battle,â said ZherkÃ³v to BolkÃ³nski, pointing
 10522	to the accountant, âbut he feels a pain in the pit of his stomach
 10523	already.â
 10524	
 10525	âOh, leave off!â said the accountant with a beaming but rather
 10526	cunning smile, as if flattered at being made the subject of ZherkÃ³vâs
 10527	joke, and purposely trying to appear stupider than he really was.
 10528	
 10529	âIt is very strange, mon Monsieur Prince,â said the staff officer.
 10530	(He remembered that in French there is some peculiar way of addressing a
 10531	prince, but could not get it quite right.)
 10532	
 10533	By this time they were all approaching TÃºshinâs battery, and a ball
 10534	struck the ground in front of them.
 10535	
 10536	âWhatâs that that has fallen?â asked the accountant with a naÃ¯ve
 10537	smile.
 10538	
 10539	âA French pancake,â answered ZherkÃ³v.
 10540	
 10541	âSo thatâs what they hit with?â asked the accountant. âHow
 10542	awful!â
 10543	
 10544	He seemed to swell with satisfaction. He had hardly finished speaking
 10545	when they again heard an unexpectedly violent whistling which suddenly
 10546	ended with a thud into something soft... f-f-flop! and a Cossack, riding
 10547	a little to their right and behind the accountant, crashed to earth with
 10548	his horse. ZherkÃ³v and the staff officer bent over their saddles and
 10549	turned their horses away. The accountant stopped, facing the Cossack,
 10550	and examined him with attentive curiosity. The Cossack was dead, but the
 10551	horse still struggled.
 10552	
 10553	Prince BagratiÃ³n screwed up his eyes, looked round, and, seeing the
 10554	cause of the confusion, turned away with indifference, as if to say,
 10555	âIs it worth while noticing trifles?â He reined in his horse with
 10556	the care of a skillful rider and, slightly bending over, disengaged his
 10557	saber which had caught in his cloak. It was an old-fashioned saber of
 10558	a kind no longer in general use. Prince Andrew remembered the story of
 10559	SuvÃ³rov giving his saber to BagratiÃ³n in Italy, and the recollection
 10560	was particularly pleasant at that moment. They had reached the battery
 10561	at which Prince Andrew had been when he examined the battlefield.
 10562	
 10563	âWhose company?â asked Prince BagratiÃ³n of an artilleryman standing
 10564	by the ammunition wagon.
 10565	
 10566	He asked, âWhose company?â but he really meant, âAre you
 10567	frightened here?â and the artilleryman understood him.
 10568	
 10569	âCaptain TÃºshinâs, your excellency!â shouted the red-haired,
 10570	freckled gunner in a merry voice, standing to attention.
 10571	
 10572	âYes, yes,â muttered BagratiÃ³n as if considering something, and he
 10573	rode past the limbers to the farthest cannon.
 10574	
 10575	As he approached, a ringing shot issued from it deafening him and his
 10576	suite, and in the smoke that suddenly surrounded the gun they could see
 10577	the gunners who had seized it straining to roll it quickly back to its
 10578	former position. A huge, broad-shouldered gunner, Number One, holding
 10579	a mop, his legs far apart, sprang to the wheel; while Number Two with
 10580	a trembling hand placed a charge in the cannonâs mouth. The short,
 10581	round-shouldered Captain TÃºshin, stumbling over the tail of the gun
 10582	carriage, moved forward and, not noticing the general, looked out
 10583	shading his eyes with his small hand.
 10584	
 10585	âLift it two lines more and it will be just right,â cried he in a
 10586	feeble voice to which he tried to impart a dashing note, ill-suited to
 10587	his weak figure. âNumber Two!â he squeaked. âFire, MedvÃ©dev!â
 10588	
 10589	BagratiÃ³n called to him, and TÃºshin, raising three fingers to his cap
 10590	with a bashful and awkward gesture not at all like a military salute
 10591	but like a priestâs benediction, approached the general. Though
 10592	TÃºshinâs guns had been intended to cannonade the valley, he was
 10593	firing incendiary balls at the village of SchÃ¶n Grabern visible just
 10594	opposite, in front of which large masses of French were advancing.
 10595	
 10596	No one had given TÃºshin orders where and at what to fire, but after
 10597	consulting his sergeant major, ZakharchÃ©nko, for whom he had great
 10598	respect, he had decided that it would be a good thing to set fire to the
 10599	village. âVery good!â said BagratiÃ³n in reply to the officerâs
 10600	report, and began deliberately to examine the whole battlefield extended
 10601	before him. The French had advanced nearest on our right. Below the
 10602	height on which the Kiev regiment was stationed, in the hollow where the
 10603	rivulet flowed, the soul-stirring rolling and crackling of musketry was
 10604	heard, and much farther to the right beyond the dragoons, the officer of
 10605	the suite pointed out to BagratiÃ³n a French column that was outflanking
 10606	us. To the left the horizon bounded by the adjacent wood. Prince
 10607	BagratiÃ³n ordered two battalions from the center to be sent to
 10608	reinforce the right flank. The officer of the suite ventured to remark
 10609	to the prince that if these battalions went away, the guns would remain
 10610	without support. Prince BagratiÃ³n turned to the officer and with his
 10611	dull eyes looked at him in silence. It seemed to Prince Andrew that the
 10612	officerâs remark was just and that really no answer could be made to
 10613	it. But at that moment an adjutant galloped up with a message from the
 10614	commander of the regiment in the hollow and news that immense masses
 10615	of the French were coming down upon them and that his regiment was in
 10616	disorder and was retreating upon the Kiev grenadiers. Prince BagratiÃ³n
 10617	bowed his head in sign of assent and approval. He rode off at a walk to
 10618	the right and sent an adjutant to the dragoons with orders to attack the
 10619	French. But this adjutant returned half an hour later with the news that
 10620	the commander of the dragoons had already retreated beyond the dip in
 10621	the ground, as a heavy fire had been opened on him and he was losing
 10622	men uselessly, and so had hastened to throw some sharpshooters into the
 10623	wood.
 10624	
 10625	âVery good!â said BagratiÃ³n.
 10626	
 10627	As he was leaving the battery, firing was heard on the left also, and
 10628	as it was too far to the left flank for him to have time to go there
 10629	himself, Prince BagratiÃ³n sent ZherkÃ³v to tell the general in command
 10630	(the one who had paraded his regiment before KutÃºzov at Braunau) that
 10631	he must retreat as quickly as possible behind the hollow in the rear,
 10632	as the right flank would probably not be able to withstand the enemyâs
 10633	attack very long. About TÃºshin and the battalion that had been in
 10634	support of his battery all was forgotten. Prince Andrew listened
 10635	attentively to BagratiÃ³nâs colloquies with the commanding officers
 10636	and the orders he gave them and, to his surprise, found that no orders
 10637	were really given, but that Prince BagratiÃ³n tried to make it appear
 10638	that everything done by necessity, by accident, or by the will of
 10639	subordinate commanders was done, if not by his direct command, at least
 10640	in accord with his intentions. Prince Andrew noticed, however, that
 10641	though what happened was due to chance and was independent of the
 10642	commanderâs will, owing to the tact BagratiÃ³n showed, his presence
 10643	was very valuable. Officers who approached him with disturbed
 10644	countenances became calm; soldiers and officers greeted him gaily, grew
 10645	more cheerful in his presence, and were evidently anxious to display
 10646	their courage before him.
 10647

 10649	
 10650	
 10651	
 10652	CHAPTER XVIII
 10653	
 10654	Prince BagratiÃ³n, having reached the highest point of our right flank,
 10655	began riding downhill to where the roll of musketry was heard but where
 10656	on account of the smoke nothing could be seen. The nearer they got to
 10657	the hollow the less they could see but the more they felt the nearness
 10658	of the actual battlefield. They began to meet wounded men. One with a
 10659	bleeding head and no cap was being dragged along by two soldiers who
 10660	supported him under the arms. There was a gurgle in his throat and he
 10661	was spitting blood. A bullet had evidently hit him in the throat or
 10662	mouth. Another was walking sturdily by himself but without his musket,
 10663	groaning aloud and swinging his arm which had just been hurt, while
 10664	blood from it was streaming over his greatcoat as from a bottle. He had
 10665	that moment been wounded and his face showed fear rather than suffering.
 10666	Crossing a road they descended a steep incline and saw several men
 10667	lying on the ground; they also met a crowd of soldiers some of whom were
 10668	unwounded. The soldiers were ascending the hill breathing heavily, and
 10669	despite the generalâs presence were talking loudly and gesticulating.
 10670	In front of them rows of gray cloaks were already visible through the
 10671	smoke, and an officer catching sight of BagratiÃ³n rushed shouting after
 10672	the crowd of retreating soldiers, ordering them back. BagratiÃ³n rode up
 10673	to the ranks along which shots crackled now here and now there, drowning
 10674	the sound of voices and the shouts of command. The whole air reeked with
 10675	smoke. The excited faces of the soldiers were blackened with it. Some
 10676	were using their ramrods, others putting powder on the touchpans or
 10677	taking charges from their pouches, while others were firing, though who
 10678	they were firing at could not be seen for the smoke which there was no
 10679	wind to carry away. A pleasant humming and whistling of bullets were
 10680	often heard. âWhat is this?â thought Prince Andrew approaching the
 10681	crowd of soldiers. âIt canât be an attack, for they are not moving;
 10682	it canât be a squareâfor they are not drawn up for that.â
 10683	
 10684	The commander of the regiment, a thin, feeble-looking old man with a
 10685	pleasant smileâhis eyelids drooping more than half over his old eyes,
 10686	giving him a mild expression, rode up to BagratiÃ³n and welcomed him as
 10687	a host welcomes an honored guest. He reported that his regiment had
 10688	been attacked by French cavalry and that, though the attack had been
 10689	repulsed, he had lost more than half his men. He said the attack
 10690	had been repulsed, employing this military term to describe what had
 10691	occurred to his regiment, but in reality he did not himself know what
 10692	had happened during that half-hour to the troops entrusted to him, and
 10693	could not say with certainty whether the attack had been repulsed or his
 10694	regiment had been broken up. All he knew was that at the commencement
 10695	of the action balls and shells began flying all over his regiment and
 10696	hitting men and that afterwards someone had shouted âCavalry!â and
 10697	our men had begun firing. They were still firing, not at the cavalry
 10698	which had disappeared, but at French infantry who had come into the
 10699	hollow and were firing at our men. Prince BagratiÃ³n bowed his head as a
 10700	sign that this was exactly what he had desired and expected. Turning
 10701	to his adjutant he ordered him to bring down the two battalions of the
 10702	Sixth Chasseurs whom they had just passed. Prince Andrew was struck by
 10703	the changed expression on Prince BagratiÃ³nâs face at this moment. It
 10704	expressed the concentrated and happy resolution you see on the face of
 10705	a man who on a hot day takes a final run before plunging into the water.
 10706	The dull, sleepy expression was no longer there, nor the affectation
 10707	of profound thought. The round, steady, hawkâs eyes looked before him
 10708	eagerly and rather disdainfully, not resting on anything although his
 10709	movements were still slow and measured.
 10710	
 10711	The commander of the regiment turned to Prince BagratiÃ³n, entreating
 10712	him to go back as it was too dangerous to remain where they were.
 10713	âPlease, your excellency, for Godâs sake!â he kept saying,
 10714	glancing for support at an officer of the suite who turned away
 10715	from him. âThere, you see!â and he drew attention to the bullets
 10716	whistling, singing, and hissing continually around them. He spoke in the
 10717	tone of entreaty and reproach that a carpenter uses to a gentleman who
 10718	has picked up an ax: âWe are used to it, but you, sir, will blister
 10719	your hands.â He spoke as if those bullets could not kill him, and his
 10720	half-closed eyes gave still more persuasiveness to his words. The staff
 10721	officer joined in the colonelâs appeals, but BagratiÃ³n did not reply;
 10722	he only gave an order to cease firing and re-form, so as to give room
 10723	for the two approaching battalions. While he was speaking, the curtain
 10724	of smoke that had concealed the hollow, driven by a rising wind, began
 10725	to move from right to left as if drawn by an invisible hand, and the
 10726	hill opposite, with the French moving about on it, opened out before
 10727	them. All eyes fastened involuntarily on this French column advancing
 10728	against them and winding down over the uneven ground. One could already
 10729	see the soldiersâ shaggy caps, distinguish the officers from the men,
 10730	and see the standard flapping against its staff.
 10731	
 10732	âThey march splendidly,â remarked someone in BagratiÃ³nâs suite.
 10733	
 10734	The head of the column had already descended into the hollow. The clash
 10735	would take place on this side of it...
 10736	
 10737	The remains of our regiment which had been in action rapidly formed up
 10738	and moved to the right; from behind it, dispersing the laggards, came
 10739	two battalions of the Sixth Chasseurs in fine order. Before they had
 10740	reached BagratiÃ³n, the weighty tread of the mass of men marching in
 10741	step could be heard. On their left flank, nearest to BagratiÃ³n, marched
 10742	a company commander, a fine round-faced man, with a stupid and happy
 10743	expressionâthe same man who had rushed out of the wattle shed. At that
 10744	moment he was clearly thinking of nothing but how dashing a fellow he
 10745	would appear as he passed the commander.
 10746	
 10747	With the self-satisfaction of a man on parade, he stepped lightly with
 10748	his muscular legs as if sailing along, stretching himself to his full
 10749	height without the smallest effort, his ease contrasting with the heavy
 10750	tread of the soldiers who were keeping step with him. He carried close
 10751	to his leg a narrow unsheathed sword (small, curved, and not like a real
 10752	weapon) and looked now at the superior officers and now back at the men
 10753	without losing step, his whole powerful body turning flexibly. It was as
 10754	if all the powers of his soul were concentrated on passing the commander
 10755	in the best possible manner, and feeling that he was doing it well he
 10756	was happy. âLeft... left... left...â he seemed to repeat to himself
 10757	at each alternate step; and in time to this, with stern but varied
 10758	faces, the wall of soldiers burdened with knapsacks and muskets marched
 10759	in step, and each one of these hundreds of soldiers seemed to be
 10760	repeating to himself at each alternate step, âLeft... left...
 10761	left...â A fat major skirted a bush, puffing and falling out of
 10762	step; a soldier who had fallen behind, his face showing alarm at his
 10763	defection, ran at a trot, panting to catch up with his company. A cannon
 10764	ball, cleaving the air, flew over the heads of BagratiÃ³n and his suite,
 10765	and fell into the column to the measure of âLeft... left!â âClose
 10766	up!â came the company commanderâs voice in jaunty tones. The
 10767	soldiers passed in a semicircle round something where the ball had
 10768	fallen, and an old trooper on the flank, a noncommissioned officer who
 10769	had stopped beside the dead men, ran to catch up his line and, falling
 10770	into step with a hop, looked back angrily, and through the ominous
 10771	silence and the regular tramp of feet beating the ground in unison, one
 10772	seemed to hear left... left... left.
 10773	
 10774	âWell done, lads!â said Prince BagratiÃ³n.
 10775	
 10776	âGlad to do our best, your exâlen-lency!â came a confused shout
 10777	from the ranks. A morose soldier marching on the left turned his eyes on
 10778	BagratiÃ³n as he shouted, with an expression that seemed to say: âWe
 10779	know that ourselves!â Another, without looking round, as though
 10780	fearing to relax, shouted with his mouth wide open and passed on.
 10781	
 10782	The order was given to halt and down knapsacks.
 10783	
 10784	BagratiÃ³n rode round the ranks that had marched past him and
 10785	dismounted. He gave the reins to a Cossack, took off and handed over his
 10786	felt coat, stretched his legs, and set his cap straight. The head of the
 10787	French column, with its officers leading, appeared from below the hill.
 10788	
 10789	âForward, with God!â said BagratiÃ³n, in a resolute, sonorous voice,
 10790	turning for a moment to the front line, and slightly swinging his arms,
 10791	he went forward uneasily over the rough field with the awkward gait of
 10792	a cavalryman. Prince Andrew felt that an invisible power was leading him
 10793	forward, and experienced great happiness.
 10794	
 10795	The French were already near. Prince Andrew, walking beside BagratiÃ³n,
 10796	could clearly distinguish their bandoliers, red epaulets, and even their
 10797	faces. (He distinctly saw an old French officer who, with gaitered
 10798	legs and turned-out toes, climbed the hill with difficulty.) Prince
 10799	BagratiÃ³n gave no further orders and silently continued to walk on in
 10800	front of the ranks. Suddenly one shot after another rang out from the
 10801	French, smoke appeared all along their uneven ranks, and musket shots
 10802	sounded. Several of our men fell, among them the round-faced officer
 10803	who had marched so gaily and complacently. But at the moment the first
 10804	report was heard, BagratiÃ³n looked round and shouted, âHurrah!â
 10805	
 10806	âHurrahâah!âah!â rang a long-drawn shout from our ranks, and
 10807	passing BagratiÃ³n and racing one another they rushed in an irregular
 10808	but joyous and eager crowd down the hill at their disordered foe.

 10814	CHAPTER XIX
 10815	
 10816	The attack of the Sixth Chasseurs secured the retreat of our right
 10817	flank. In the center TÃºshinâs forgotten battery, which had managed to
 10818	set fire to the SchÃ¶n Grabern village, delayed the French advance. The
 10819	French were putting out the fire which the wind was spreading, and thus
 10820	gave us time to retreat. The retirement of the center to the other side
 10821	of the dip in the ground at the rear was hurried and noisy, but the
 10822	different companies did not get mixed. But our leftâwhich consisted
 10823	of the AzÃ³v and PodÃ³lsk infantry and the PÃ¡vlograd hussarsâwas
 10824	simultaneously attacked and outflanked by superior French forces under
 10825	Lannes and was thrown into confusion. BagratiÃ³n had sent ZherkÃ³v
 10826	to the general commanding that left flank with orders to retreat
 10827	immediately.
 10828	
 10829	ZherkÃ³v, not removing his hand from his cap, turned his horse about
 10830	and galloped off. But no sooner had he left BagratiÃ³n than his courage
 10831	failed him. He was seized by panic and could not go where it was
 10832	dangerous.
 10833	
 10834	Having reached the left flank, instead of going to the front where the
 10835	firing was, he began to look for the general and his staff where they
 10836	could not possibly be, and so did not deliver the order.
 10837	
 10838	The command of the left flank belonged by seniority to the commander of
 10839	the regiment KutÃºzov had reviewed at Braunau and in which DÃ³lokhov was
 10840	serving as a private. But the command of the extreme left flank had been
 10841	assigned to the commander of the PÃ¡vlograd regiment in which RostÃ³v
 10842	was serving, and a misunderstanding arose. The two commanders were much
 10843	exasperated with one another and, long after the action had begun on
 10844	the right flank and the French were already advancing, were engaged
 10845	in discussion with the sole object of offending one another. But the
 10846	regiments, both cavalry and infantry, were by no means ready for the
 10847	impending action. From privates to general they were not expecting a
 10848	battle and were engaged in peaceful occupations, the cavalry feeding the
 10849	horses and the infantry collecting wood.
 10850	
 10851	âHe higher iss dan I in rank,â said the German colonel of the
 10852	hussars, flushing and addressing an adjutant who had ridden up, âso
 10853	let him do what he vill, but I cannot sacrifice my hussars... Bugler,
 10854	sount ze retreat!â
 10855	
 10856	But haste was becoming imperative. Cannon and musketry, mingling
 10857	together, thundered on the right and in the center, while the capotes
 10858	of Lannesâ sharpshooters were already seen crossing the milldam and
 10859	forming up within twice the range of a musket shot. The general in
 10860	command of the infantry went toward his horse with jerky steps, and
 10861	having mounted drew himself up very straight and tall and rode to the
 10862	PÃ¡vlograd commander. The commanders met with polite bows but with
 10863	secret malevolence in their hearts.
 10864	
 10865	âOnce again, Colonel,â said the general, âI canât leave half
 10866	my men in the wood. I beg of you, I beg of you,â he repeated, âto
 10867	occupy the position and prepare for an attack.â
 10868	
 10869	âI peg of you yourself not to mix in vot is not your business!â
 10870	suddenly replied the irate colonel. âIf you vere in the cavalry...â
 10871	
 10872	âI am not in the cavalry, Colonel, but I am a Russian general and if
 10873	you are not aware of the fact...â
 10874	
 10875	âQuite avare, your excellency,â suddenly shouted the colonel,
 10876	touching his horse and turning purple in the face. âVill you be so
 10877	goot to come to ze front and see dat zis position iss no goot? I donât
 10878	vish to destroy my men for your pleasure!â
 10879	
 10880	âYou forget yourself, Colonel. I am not considering my own pleasure
 10881	and I wonât allow it to be said!â
 10882	
 10883	Taking the colonelâs outburst as a challenge to his courage, the
 10884	general expanded his chest and rode, frowning, beside him to the
 10885	front line, as if their differences would be settled there amongst the
 10886	bullets. They reached the front, several bullets sped over them, and
 10887	they halted in silence. There was nothing fresh to be seen from the
 10888	line, for from where they had been before it had been evident that it
 10889	was impossible for cavalry to act among the bushes and broken ground,
 10890	as well as that the French were outflanking our left. The general
 10891	and colonel looked sternly and significantly at one another like two
 10892	fighting cocks preparing for battle, each vainly trying to detect signs
 10893	of cowardice in the other. Both passed the examination successfully. As
 10894	there was nothing to be said, and neither wished to give occasion for
 10895	it to be alleged that he had been the first to leave the range of fire,
 10896	they would have remained there for a long time testing each otherâs
 10897	courage had it not been that just then they heard the rattle of musketry
 10898	and a muffled shout almost behind them in the wood. The French had
 10899	attacked the men collecting wood in the copse. It was no longer possible
 10900	for the hussars to retreat with the infantry. They were cut off from
 10901	the line of retreat on the left by the French. However inconvenient the
 10902	position, it was now necessary to attack in order to cut a way through
 10903	for themselves.
 10904	
 10905	The squadron in which RostÃ³v was serving had scarcely time to mount
 10906	before it was halted facing the enemy. Again, as at the Enns bridge,
 10907	there was nothing between the squadron and the enemy, and again that
 10908	terrible dividing line of uncertainty and fearâresembling the line
 10909	separating the living from the deadâlay between them. All were
 10910	conscious of this unseen line, and the question whether they would cross
 10911	it or not, and how they would cross it, agitated them all.
 10912	
 10913	The colonel rode to the front, angrily gave some reply to questions put
 10914	to him by the officers, and, like a man desperately insisting on having
 10915	his own way, gave an order. No one said anything definite, but the rumor
 10916	of an attack spread through the squadron. The command to form up rang
 10917	out and the sabers whizzed as they were drawn from their scabbards.
 10918	Still no one moved. The troops of the left flank, infantry and hussars
 10919	alike, felt that the commander did not himself know what to do, and this
 10920	irresolution communicated itself to the men.
 10921	
 10922	âIf only they would be quick!â thought RostÃ³v, feeling that at last
 10923	the time had come to experience the joy of an attack of which he had so
 10924	often heard from his fellow hussars.
 10925	
 10926	âFoâward, with God, lads!â rang out DenÃ­sovâs voice. âAt a
 10927	twot foâward!â
 10928	
 10929	The horsesâ croups began to sway in the front line. Rook pulled at the
 10930	reins and started of his own accord.
 10931	
 10932	Before him, on the right, RostÃ³v saw the front lines of his hussars and
 10933	still farther ahead a dark line which he could not see distinctly but
 10934	took to be the enemy. Shots could be heard, but some way off.
 10935	
 10936	âFaster!â came the word of command, and RostÃ³v felt Rookâs flanks
 10937	drooping as he broke into a gallop.
 10938	
 10939	RostÃ³v anticipated his horseâs movements and became more and more
 10940	elated. He had noticed a solitary tree ahead of him. This tree had been
 10941	in the middle of the line that had seemed so terribleâand now he
 10942	had crossed that line and not only was there nothing terrible, but
 10943	everything was becoming more and more happy and animated. âOh, how I
 10944	will slash at him!â thought RostÃ³v, gripping the hilt of his saber.
 10945	
 10946	âHur-a-a-a-ah!â came a roar of voices. âLet anyone come my way
 10947	now,â thought RostÃ³v driving his spurs into Rook and letting him go
 10948	at a full gallop so that he outstripped the others. Ahead, the enemy was
 10949	already visible. Suddenly something like a birch broom seemed to sweep
 10950	over the squadron. RostÃ³v raised his saber, ready to strike, but at
 10951	that instant the trooper NikÃ­tenko, who was galloping ahead, shot away
 10952	from him, and RostÃ³v felt as in a dream that he continued to be carried
 10953	forward with unnatural speed but yet stayed on the same spot. From
 10954	behind him BondarchÃºk, an hussar he knew, jolted against him and looked
 10955	angrily at him. BondarchÃºkâs horse swerved and galloped past.
 10956	
 10957	âHow is it I am not moving? I have fallen, I am killed!â RostÃ³v
 10958	asked and answered at the same instant. He was alone in the middle of a
 10959	field. Instead of the moving horses and hussarsâ backs, he saw nothing
 10960	before him but the motionless earth and the stubble around him. There
 10961	was warm blood under his arm. âNo, I am wounded and the horse is
 10962	killed.â Rook tried to rise on his forelegs but fell back, pinning his
 10963	riderâs leg. Blood was flowing from his head; he struggled but could
 10964	not rise. RostÃ³v also tried to rise but fell back, his sabretache
 10965	having become entangled in the saddle. Where our men were, and where the
 10966	French, he did not know. There was no one near.
 10967	
 10968	Having disentangled his leg, he rose. âWhere, on which side, was now
 10969	the line that had so sharply divided the two armies?â he asked himself
 10970	and could not answer. âCan something bad have happened to me?â
 10971	he wondered as he got up: and at that moment he felt that something
 10972	superfluous was hanging on his benumbed left arm. The wrist felt as if
 10973	it were not his. He examined his hand carefully, vainly trying to find
 10974	blood on it. âAh, here are people coming,â he thought joyfully,
 10975	seeing some men running toward him. âThey will help me!â In front
 10976	came a man wearing a strange shako and a blue cloak, swarthy, sunburned,
 10977	and with a hooked nose. Then came two more, and many more running
 10978	behind. One of them said something strange, not in Russian. In among the
 10979	hindmost of these men wearing similar shakos was a Russian hussar. He
 10980	was being held by the arms and his horse was being led behind him.
 10981	
 10982	âIt must be one of ours, a prisoner. Yes. Can it be that they will
 10983	take me too? Who are these men?â thought RostÃ³v, scarcely believing
 10984	his eyes. âCan they be French?â He looked at the approaching
 10985	Frenchmen, and though but a moment before he had been galloping to get
 10986	at them and hack them to pieces, their proximity now seemed so awful
 10987	that he could not believe his eyes. âWho are they? Why are they
 10988	running? Can they be coming at me? And why? To kill me? Me whom everyone
 10989	is so fond of?â He remembered his motherâs love for him, and his
 10990	familyâs, and his friendsâ, and the enemyâs intention to kill him
 10991	seemed impossible. âBut perhaps they may do it!â For more than ten
 10992	seconds he stood not moving from the spot or realizing the situation.
 10993	The foremost Frenchman, the one with the hooked nose, was already so
 10994	close that the expression of his face could be seen. And the excited,
 10995	alien face of that man, his bayonet hanging down, holding his breath,
 10996	and running so lightly, frightened RostÃ³v. He seized his pistol and,
 10997	instead of firing it, flung it at the Frenchman and ran with all his
 10998	might toward the bushes. He did not now run with the feeling of doubt
 10999	and conflict with which he had trodden the Enns bridge, but with the
 11000	feeling of a hare fleeing from the hounds. One single sentiment, that
 11001	of fear for his young and happy life, possessed his whole being. Rapidly
 11002	leaping the furrows, he fled across the field with the impetuosity he
 11003	used to show at catchplay, now and then turning his good-natured, pale,
 11004	young face to look back. A shudder of terror went through him: âNo,
 11005	better not look,â he thought, but having reached the bushes he glanced
 11006	round once more. The French had fallen behind, and just as he looked
 11007	round the first man changed his run to a walk and, turning, shouted
 11008	something loudly to a comrade farther back. RostÃ³v paused. âNo,
 11009	thereâs some mistake,â thought he. âThey canât have wanted to
 11010	kill me.â But at the same time, his left arm felt as heavy as if
 11011	a seventy-pound weight were tied to it. He could run no more. The
 11012	Frenchman also stopped and took aim. RostÃ³v closed his eyes and stooped
 11013	down. One bullet and then another whistled past him. He mustered his
 11014	last remaining strength, took hold of his left hand with his right, and
 11015	reached the bushes. Behind these were some Russian sharpshooters.
 11016	
 11017

 11020	
 11021	CHAPTER XX
 11022	
 11023	The infantry regiments that had been caught unawares in the outskirts
 11024	of the wood ran out of it, the different companies getting mixed, and
 11025	retreated as a disorderly crowd. One soldier, in his fear, uttered the
 11026	senseless cry, âCut off!â that is so terrible in battle, and that
 11027	word infected the whole crowd with a feeling of panic.
 11028	
 11029	âSurrounded! Cut off? Weâre lost!â shouted the fugitives.
 11030	
 11031	The moment he heard the firing and the cry from behind, the general
 11032	realized that something dreadful had happened to his regiment, and the
 11033	thought that he, an exemplary officer of many yearsâ service who
 11034	had never been to blame, might be held responsible at headquarters
 11035	for negligence or inefficiency so staggered him that, forgetting the
 11036	recalcitrant cavalry colonel, his own dignity as a general, and above
 11037	all quite forgetting the danger and all regard for self-preservation, he
 11038	clutched the crupper of his saddle and, spurring his horse, galloped to
 11039	the regiment under a hail of bullets which fell around, but fortunately
 11040	missed him. His one desire was to know what was happening and at any
 11041	cost correct, or remedy, the mistake if he had made one, so that he,
 11042	an exemplary officer of twenty-two yearsâ service, who had never been
 11043	censured, should not be held to blame.
 11044	
 11045	Having galloped safely through the French, he reached a field behind
 11046	the copse across which our men, regardless of orders, were running and
 11047	descending the valley. That moment of moral hesitation which decides
 11048	the fate of battles had arrived. Would this disorderly crowd of soldiers
 11049	attend to the voice of their commander, or would they, disregarding him,
 11050	continue their flight? Despite his desperate shouts that used to seem
 11051	so terrible to the soldiers, despite his furious purple countenance
 11052	distorted out of all likeness to his former self, and the flourishing of
 11053	his saber, the soldiers all continued to run, talking, firing into the
 11054	air, and disobeying orders. The moral hesitation which decided the fate
 11055	of battles was evidently culminating in a panic.
 11056	
 11057	The general had a fit of coughing as a result of shouting and of the
 11058	powder smoke and stopped in despair. Everything seemed lost. But at that
 11059	moment the French who were attacking, suddenly and without any apparent
 11060	reason, ran back and disappeared from the outskirts, and Russian
 11061	sharpshooters showed themselves in the copse. It was TimÃ³khinâs
 11062	company, which alone had maintained its order in the wood and, having
 11063	lain in ambush in a ditch, now attacked the French unexpectedly.
 11064	TimÃ³khin, armed only with a sword, had rushed at the enemy with such
 11065	a desperate cry and such mad, drunken determination that, taken by
 11066	surprise, the French had thrown down their muskets and run. DÃ³lokhov,
 11067	running beside TimÃ³khin, killed a Frenchman at close quarters and was
 11068	the first to seize the surrendering French officer by his collar. Our
 11069	fugitives returned, the battalions re-formed, and the French who had
 11070	nearly cut our left flank in half were for the moment repulsed. Our
 11071	reserve units were able to join up, and the fight was at an end. The
 11072	regimental commander and Major EkonÃ³mov had stopped beside a bridge,
 11073	letting the retreating companies pass by them, when a soldier came up
 11074	and took hold of the commanderâs stirrup, almost leaning against him.
 11075	The man was wearing a bluish coat of broadcloth, he had no knapsack
 11076	or cap, his head was bandaged, and over his shoulder a French munition
 11077	pouch was slung. He had an officerâs sword in his hand. The soldier
 11078	was pale, his blue eyes looked impudently into the commanderâs face,
 11079	and his lips were smiling. Though the commander was occupied in giving
 11080	instructions to Major EkonÃ³mov, he could not help taking notice of the
 11081	soldier.
 11082	
 11083	âYour excellency, here are two trophies,â said DÃ³lokhov, pointing
 11084	to the French sword and pouch. âI have taken an officer prisoner. I
 11085	stopped the company.â DÃ³lokhov breathed heavily from weariness and
 11086	spoke in abrupt sentences. âThe whole company can bear witness. I beg
 11087	you will remember this, your excellency!â
 11088	
 11089	âAll right, all right,â replied the commander, and turned to Major
 11090	EkonÃ³mov.
 11091	
 11092	But DÃ³lokhov did not go away; he untied the handkerchief around his
 11093	head, pulled it off, and showed the blood congealed on his hair.
 11094	
 11095	âA bayonet wound. I remained at the front. Remember, your
 11096	excellency!â
 11097	
 11098	
 11099	TÃºshinâs battery had been forgotten and only at the very end of the
 11100	action did Prince BagratiÃ³n, still hearing the cannonade in the center,
 11101	send his orderly staff officer, and later Prince Andrew also, to order
 11102	the battery to retire as quickly as possible. When the supports attached
 11103	to TÃºshinâs battery had been moved away in the middle of the action
 11104	by someoneâs order, the battery had continued firing and was only not
 11105	captured by the French because the enemy could not surmise that anyone
 11106	could have the effrontery to continue firing from four quite undefended
 11107	guns. On the contrary, the energetic action of that battery led the
 11108	French to suppose that hereâin the centerâthe main Russian forces
 11109	were concentrated. Twice they had attempted to attack this point, but on
 11110	each occasion had been driven back by grapeshot from the four isolated
 11111	guns on the hillock.
 11112	
 11113	Soon after Prince BagratiÃ³n had left him, TÃºshin had succeeded in
 11114	setting fire to SchÃ¶n Grabern.
 11115	
 11116	âLook at them scurrying! Itâs burning! Just see the smoke! Fine!
 11117	Grand! Look at the smoke, the smoke!â exclaimed the artillerymen,
 11118	brightening up.
 11119	
 11120	All the guns, without waiting for orders, were being fired in the
 11121	direction of the conflagration. As if urging each other on, the soldiers
 11122	cried at each shot: âFine! Thatâs good! Look at it... Grand!â The
 11123	fire, fanned by the breeze, was rapidly spreading. The French columns
 11124	that had advanced beyond the village went back; but as though in revenge
 11125	for this failure, the enemy placed ten guns to the right of the village
 11126	and began firing them at TÃºshinâs battery.
 11127	
 11128	In their childlike glee, aroused by the fire and their luck in
 11129	successfully cannonading the French, our artillerymen only noticed this
 11130	battery when two balls, and then four more, fell among our guns, one
 11131	knocking over two horses and another tearing off a munition-wagon
 11132	driverâs leg. Their spirits once roused were, however, not diminished,
 11133	but only changed character. The horses were replaced by others from a
 11134	reserve gun carriage, the wounded were carried away, and the four guns
 11135	were turned against the ten-gun battery. TÃºshinâs companion officer
 11136	had been killed at the beginning of the engagement and within an hour
 11137	seventeen of the forty men of the gunsâ crews had been disabled, but
 11138	the artillerymen were still as merry and lively as ever. Twice they
 11139	noticed the French appearing below them, and then they fired grapeshot
 11140	at them.
 11141	
 11142	Little TÃºshin, moving feebly and awkwardly, kept telling his orderly to
 11143	ârefill my pipe for that one!â and then, scattering sparks from it,
 11144	ran forward shading his eyes with his small hand to look at the French.
 11145	
 11146	âSmack at âem, lads!â he kept saying, seizing the guns by the
 11147	wheels and working the screws himself.
 11148	
 11149	Amid the smoke, deafened by the incessant reports which always made him
 11150	jump, TÃºshin not taking his pipe from his mouth ran from gun to gun,
 11151	now aiming, now counting the charges, now giving orders about replacing
 11152	dead or wounded horses and harnessing fresh ones, and shouting in his
 11153	feeble voice, so high pitched and irresolute. His face grew more and
 11154	more animated. Only when a man was killed or wounded did he frown and
 11155	turn away from the sight, shouting angrily at the men who, as is always
 11156	the case, hesitated about lifting the injured or dead. The soldiers,
 11157	for the most part handsome fellows and, as is always the case in an
 11158	artillery company, a head and shoulders taller and twice as broad
 11159	as their officerâall looked at their commander like children in an
 11160	embarrassing situation, and the expression on his face was invariably
 11161	reflected on theirs.
 11162	
 11163	Owing to the terrible uproar and the necessity for concentration and
 11164	activity, TÃºshin did not experience the slightest unpleasant sense of
 11165	fear, and the thought that he might be killed or badly wounded never
 11166	occurred to him. On the contrary, he became more and more elated. It
 11167	seemed to him that it was a very long time ago, almost a day, since he
 11168	had first seen the enemy and fired the first shot, and that the corner
 11169	of the field he stood on was well-known and familiar ground. Though he
 11170	thought of everything, considered everything, and did everything the
 11171	best of officers could do in his position, he was in a state akin to
 11172	feverish delirium or drunkenness.
 11173	
 11174	From the deafening sounds of his own guns around him, the whistle and
 11175	thud of the enemyâs cannon balls, from the flushed and perspiring
 11176	faces of the crew bustling round the guns, from the sight of the blood
 11177	of men and horses, from the little puffs of smoke on the enemyâs side
 11178	(always followed by a ball flying past and striking the earth, a man, a
 11179	gun, a horse), from the sight of all these things a fantastic world of
 11180	his own had taken possession of his brain and at that moment afforded
 11181	him pleasure. The enemyâs guns were in his fancy not guns but pipes
 11182	from which occasional puffs were blown by an invisible smoker.
 11183	
 11184	âThere... heâs puffing again,â muttered TÃºshin to himself, as a
 11185	small cloud rose from the hill and was borne in a streak to the left by
 11186	the wind.
 11187	
 11188	âNow look out for the ball... weâll throw it back.â
 11189	
 11190	âWhat do you want, your honor?â asked an artilleryman, standing
 11191	close by, who heard him muttering.
 11192	
 11193	âNothing... only a shell...â he answered.
 11194	
 11195	âCome along, our MatvÃ©vna!â he said to himself. âMatvÃ©vnaâ *
 11196	was the name his fancy gave to the farthest gun of the battery, which
 11197	was large and of an old pattern. The French swarming round their guns
 11198	seemed to him like ants. In that world, the handsome drunkard Number One
 11199	of the second gunâs crew was âuncleâ; TÃºshin looked at him more
 11200	often than at anyone else and took delight in his every movement.
 11201	The sound of musketry at the foot of the hill, now diminishing, now
 11202	increasing, seemed like someoneâs breathing. He listened intently to
 11203	the ebb and flow of these sounds.
 11204	
 11205	    * Daughter of Matthew.
 11206	
 11207	âAh! Breathing again, breathing!â he muttered to himself.
 11208	
 11209	He imagined himself as an enormously tall, powerful man who was throwing
 11210	cannon balls at the French with both hands.
 11211	
 11212	âNow then, MatvÃ©vna, dear old lady, donât let me down!â he was
 11213	saying as he moved from the gun, when a strange, unfamiliar voice called
 11214	above his head: âCaptain TÃºshin! Captain!â
 11215	
 11216	TÃºshin turned round in dismay. It was the staff officer who had turned
 11217	him out of the booth at Grunth. He was shouting in a gasping voice:
 11218	
 11219	âAre you mad? You have twice been ordered to retreat, and you...â
 11220	
 11221	âWhy are they down on me?â thought TÃºshin, looking in alarm at his
 11222	superior.
 11223	
 11224	âI... donât...â he muttered, holding up two fingers to his cap.
 11225	âI...â
 11226	
 11227	But the staff officer did not finish what he wanted to say. A cannon
 11228	ball, flying close to him, caused him to duck and bend over his horse.
 11229	He paused, and just as he was about to say something more, another ball
 11230	stopped him. He turned his horse and galloped off.
 11231	
 11232	âRetire! All to retire!â he shouted from a distance.
 11233	
 11234	The soldiers laughed. A moment later, an adjutant arrived with the same
 11235	order.
 11236	
 11237	It was Prince Andrew. The first thing he saw on riding up to the space
 11238	where TÃºshinâs guns were stationed was an unharnessed horse with a
 11239	broken leg, that lay screaming piteously beside the harnessed horses.
 11240	Blood was gushing from its leg as from a spring. Among the limbers lay
 11241	several dead men. One ball after another passed over as he approached
 11242	and he felt a nervous shudder run down his spine. But the mere thought
 11243	of being afraid roused him again. âI cannot be afraid,â thought he,
 11244	and dismounted slowly among the guns. He delivered the order and did
 11245	not leave the battery. He decided to have the guns removed from their
 11246	positions and withdrawn in his presence. Together with TÃºshin, stepping
 11247	across the bodies and under a terrible fire from the French, he attended
 11248	to the removal of the guns.
 11249	
 11250	âA staff officer was here a minute ago, but skipped off,â said an
 11251	artilleryman to Prince Andrew. âNot like your honor!â
 11252	
 11253	Prince Andrew said nothing to TÃºshin. They were both so busy as to seem
 11254	not to notice one another. When having limbered up the only two cannon
 11255	that remained uninjured out of the four, they began moving down the hill
 11256	(one shattered gun and one unicorn were left behind), Prince Andrew rode
 11257	up to TÃºshin.
 11258	
 11259	âWell, till we meet again...â he said, holding out his hand to
 11260	TÃºshin.
 11261	
 11262	âGood-by, my dear fellow,â said TÃºshin. âDear soul! Good-by, my
 11263	dear fellow!â and for some unknown reason tears suddenly filled his
 11264	eyes.
 11265	
 11266	
 11267	
 11268	
 11269	
 11270	CHAPTER XXI
 11271	
 11272	The wind had fallen and black clouds, merging with the powder smoke,
 11273	hung low over the field of battle on the horizon. It was growing
 11274	dark and the glow of two conflagrations was the more conspicuous. The
 11275	cannonade was dying down, but the rattle of musketry behind and on the
 11276	right sounded oftener and nearer. As soon as TÃºshin with his guns,
 11277	continually driving round or coming upon wounded men, was out of range
 11278	of fire and had descended into the dip, he was met by some of the staff,
 11279	among them the staff officer and ZherkÃ³v, who had been twice sent to
 11280	TÃºshinâs battery but had never reached it. Interrupting one
 11281	another, they all gave, and transmitted, orders as to how to proceed,
 11282	reprimanding and reproaching him. TÃºshin gave no orders, and,
 11283	silentlyâfearing to speak because at every word he felt ready to
 11284	weep without knowing whyârode behind on his artillery nag. Though
 11285	the orders were to abandon the wounded, many of them dragged themselves
 11286	after troops and begged for seats on the gun carriages. The jaunty
 11287	infantry officer who just before the battle had rushed out of
 11288	TÃºshinâs wattle shed was laid, with a bullet in his stomach, on
 11289	âMatvÃ©vnaâsâ carriage. At the foot of the hill, a pale hussar
 11290	cadet, supporting one hand with the other, came up to TÃºshin and asked
 11291	for a seat.
 11292	
 11293	âCaptain, for Godâs sake! Iâve hurt my arm,â he said timidly.
 11294	âFor Godâs sake... I canât walk. For Godâs sake!â
 11295	
 11296	It was plain that this cadet had already repeatedly asked for a lift and
 11297	been refused. He asked in a hesitating, piteous voice.
 11298	
 11299	âTell them to give me a seat, for Godâs sake!â
 11300	
 11301	âGive him a seat,â said TÃºshin. âLay a cloak for him to sit on,
 11302	lad,â he said, addressing his favorite soldier. âAnd where is the
 11303	wounded officer?â
 11304	
 11305	âHe has been set down. He died,â replied someone.
 11306	
 11307	âHelp him up. Sit down, dear fellow, sit down! Spread out the cloak,
 11308	AntÃ³nov.â
 11309	
 11310	The cadet was RostÃ³v. With one hand he supported the other; he was
 11311	pale and his jaw trembled, shivering feverishly. He was placed on
 11312	âMatvÃ©vna,â the gun from which they had removed the dead officer.
 11313	The cloak they spread under him was wet with blood which stained his
 11314	breeches and arm.
 11315	
 11316	âWhat, are you wounded, my lad?â said TÃºshin, approaching the gun
 11317	on which RostÃ³v sat.
 11318	
 11319	âNo, itâs a sprain.â
 11320	
 11321	âThen what is this blood on the gun carriage?â inquired TÃºshin.
 11322	
 11323	âIt was the officer, your honor, stained it,â answered the
 11324	artilleryman, wiping away the blood with his coat sleeve, as if
 11325	apologizing for the state of his gun.
 11326	
 11327	It was all that they could do to get the guns up the rise aided by the
 11328	infantry, and having reached the village of Gruntersdorf they halted. It
 11329	had grown so dark that one could not distinguish the uniforms ten paces
 11330	off, and the firing had begun to subside. Suddenly, near by on the
 11331	right, shouting and firing were again heard. Flashes of shot gleamed in
 11332	the darkness. This was the last French attack and was met by soldiers
 11333	who had sheltered in the village houses. They all rushed out of
 11334	the village again, but TÃºshinâs guns could not move, and the
 11335	artillerymen, TÃºshin, and the cadet exchanged silent glances as they
 11336	awaited their fate. The firing died down and soldiers, talking eagerly,
 11337	streamed out of a side street.
 11338	
 11339	âNot hurt, PetrÃ³v?â asked one.
 11340	
 11341	âWeâve given it âem hot, mate! They wonât make another push
 11342	now,â said another.
 11343	
 11344	âYou couldnât see a thing. How they shot at their own fellows!
 11345	Nothing could be seen. Pitch-dark, brother! Isnât there something to
 11346	drink?â
 11347	
 11348	The French had been repulsed for the last time. And again and again in
 11349	the complete darkness TÃºshinâs guns moved forward, surrounded by the
 11350	humming infantry as by a frame.
 11351	
 11352	In the darkness, it seemed as though a gloomy unseen river was flowing
 11353	always in one direction, humming with whispers and talk and the sound of
 11354	hoofs and wheels. Amid the general rumble, the groans and voices of the
 11355	wounded were more distinctly heard than any other sound in the darkness
 11356	of the night. The gloom that enveloped the army was filled with their
 11357	groans, which seemed to melt into one with the darkness of the night.
 11358	After a while the moving mass became agitated, someone rode past on
 11359	a white horse followed by his suite, and said something in passing:
 11360	âWhat did he say? Where to, now? Halt, is it? Did he thank us?â came
 11361	eager questions from all sides. The whole moving mass began pressing
 11362	closer together and a report spread that they were ordered to halt:
 11363	evidently those in front had halted. All remained where they were in the
 11364	middle of the muddy road.
 11365	
 11366	Fires were lighted and the talk became more audible. Captain TÃºshin,
 11367	having given orders to his company, sent a soldier to find a dressing
 11368	station or a doctor for the cadet, and sat down by a bonfire the
 11369	soldiers had kindled on the road. RostÃ³v, too, dragged himself to the
 11370	fire. From pain, cold, and damp, a feverish shivering shook his whole
 11371	body. Drowsiness was irresistibly mastering him, but he kept awake by
 11372	an excruciating pain in his arm, for which he could find no satisfactory
 11373	position. He kept closing his eyes and then again looking at the fire,
 11374	which seemed to him dazzlingly red, and at the feeble, round-shouldered
 11375	figure of TÃºshin who was sitting cross-legged like a Turk beside him.
 11376	TÃºshinâs large, kind, intelligent eyes were fixed with sympathy and
 11377	commiseration on RostÃ³v, who saw that TÃºshin with his whole heart
 11378	wished to help him but could not.
 11379	
 11380	From all sides were heard the footsteps and talk of the infantry, who
 11381	were walking, driving past, and settling down all around. The sound
 11382	of voices, the tramping feet, the horsesâ hoofs moving in mud, the
 11383	crackling of wood fires near and afar, merged into one tremulous rumble.
 11384	
 11385	It was no longer, as before, a dark, unseen river flowing through the
 11386	gloom, but a dark sea swelling and gradually subsiding after a storm.
 11387	RostÃ³v looked at and listened listlessly to what passed before and
 11388	around him. An infantryman came to the fire, squatted on his heels, held
 11389	his hands to the blaze, and turned away his face.
 11390	
 11391	âYou donât mind your honor?â he asked TÃºshin. âIâve lost my
 11392	company, your honor. I donât know where... such bad luck!â
 11393	
 11394	With the soldier, an infantry officer with a bandaged cheek came up to
 11395	the bonfire, and addressing TÃºshin asked him to have the guns moved a
 11396	trifle to let a wagon go past. After he had gone, two soldiers rushed to
 11397	the campfire. They were quarreling and fighting desperately, each trying
 11398	to snatch from the other a boot they were both holding on to.
 11399	
 11400	âYou picked it up?... I dare say! Youâre very smart!â one of them
 11401	shouted hoarsely.
 11402	
 11403	Then a thin, pale soldier, his neck bandaged with a bloodstained leg
 11404	band, came up and in angry tones asked the artillerymen for water.
 11405	
 11406	âMust one die like a dog?â said he.
 11407	
 11408	TÃºshin told them to give the man some water. Then a cheerful soldier
 11409	ran up, begging a little fire for the infantry.
 11410	
 11411	âA nice little hot torch for the infantry! Good luck to you, fellow
 11412	countrymen. Thanks for the fireâweâll return it with interest,â
 11413	said he, carrying away into the darkness a glowing stick.
 11414	
 11415	Next came four soldiers, carrying something heavy on a cloak, and passed
 11416	by the fire. One of them stumbled.
 11417	
 11418	âWho the devil has put the logs on the road?â snarled he.
 11419	
 11420	âHeâs deadâwhy carry him?â said another.
 11421	
 11422	âShut up!â
 11423	
 11424	And they disappeared into the darkness with their load.
 11425	
 11426	âStill aching?â TÃºshin asked RostÃ³v in a whisper.
 11427	
 11428	âYes.â
 11429	
 11430	âYour honor, youâre wanted by the general. He is in the hut here,â
 11431	said a gunner, coming up to TÃºshin.
 11432	
 11433	âComing, friend.â
 11434	
 11435	TÃºshin rose and, buttoning his greatcoat and pulling it straight,
 11436	walked away from the fire.
 11437	
 11438	Not far from the artillery campfire, in a hut that had been prepared
 11439	for him, Prince BagratiÃ³n sat at dinner, talking with some commanding
 11440	officers who had gathered at his quarters. The little old man with
 11441	the half-closed eyes was there greedily gnawing a mutton bone, and the
 11442	general who had served blamelessly for twenty-two years, flushed by a
 11443	glass of vodka and the dinner; and the staff officer with the signet
 11444	ring, and ZherkÃ³v, uneasily glancing at them all, and Prince Andrew,
 11445	pale, with compressed lips and feverishly glittering eyes.
 11446	
 11447	In a corner of the hut stood a standard captured from the French, and
 11448	the accountant with the naÃ¯ve face was feeling its texture, shaking his
 11449	head in perplexityâperhaps because the banner really interested him,
 11450	perhaps because it was hard for him, hungry as he was, to look on at
 11451	a dinner where there was no place for him. In the next hut there was a
 11452	French colonel who had been taken prisoner by our dragoons. Our officers
 11453	were flocking in to look at him. Prince BagratiÃ³n was thanking the
 11454	individual commanders and inquiring into details of the action and our
 11455	losses. The general whose regiment had been inspected at Braunau was
 11456	informing the prince that as soon as the action began he had withdrawn
 11457	from the wood, mustered the men who were woodcutting, and, allowing the
 11458	French to pass him, had made a bayonet charge with two battalions and
 11459	had broken up the French troops.
 11460	
 11461	âWhen I saw, your excellency, that their first battalion was
 11462	disorganized, I stopped in the road and thought: âIâll let them
 11463	come on and will meet them with the fire of the whole battalionââand
 11464	thatâs what I did.â
 11465	
 11466	The general had so wished to do this and was so sorry he had not managed
 11467	to do it that it seemed to him as if it had really happened. Perhaps
 11468	it might really have been so? Could one possibly make out amid all that
 11469	confusion what did or did not happen?
 11470	
 11471	âBy the way, your excellency, I should inform you,â he
 11472	continuedâremembering DÃ³lokhovâs conversation with KutÃºzov and his
 11473	last interview with the gentleman-rankerââthat Private DÃ³lokhov,
 11474	who was reduced to the ranks, took a French officer prisoner in my
 11475	presence and particularly distinguished himself.â
 11476	
 11477	âI saw the PÃ¡vlograd hussars attack there, your excellency,â chimed
 11478	in ZherkÃ³v, looking uneasily around. He had not seen the hussars all
 11479	that day, but had heard about them from an infantry officer. âThey
 11480	broke up two squares, your excellency.â
 11481	
 11482	Several of those present smiled at ZherkÃ³vâs words, expecting one of
 11483	his usual jokes, but noticing that what he was saying redounded to
 11484	the glory of our arms and of the dayâs work, they assumed a serious
 11485	expression, though many of them knew that what he was saying was a lie
 11486	devoid of any foundation. Prince BagratiÃ³n turned to the old colonel:
 11487	
 11488	âGentlemen, I thank you all; all arms have behaved heroically:
 11489	infantry, cavalry, and artillery. How was it that two guns were
 11490	abandoned in the center?â he inquired, searching with his eyes for
 11491	someone. (Prince BagratiÃ³n did not ask about the guns on the left
 11492	flank; he knew that all the guns there had been abandoned at the very
 11493	beginning of the action.) âI think I sent you?â he added, turning to
 11494	the staff officer on duty.
 11495	
 11496	âOne was damaged,â answered the staff officer, âand the other I
 11497	canât understand. I was there all the time giving orders and had only
 11498	just left.... It is true that it was hot there,â he added, modestly.
 11499	
 11500	Someone mentioned that Captain TÃºshin was bivouacking close to the
 11501	village and had already been sent for.
 11502	
 11503	âOh, but you were there?â said Prince BagratiÃ³n, addressing Prince
 11504	Andrew.
 11505	
 11506	âOf course, we only just missed one another,â said the staff
 11507	officer, with a smile to BolkÃ³nski.
 11508	
 11509	âI had not the pleasure of seeing you,â said Prince Andrew, coldly
 11510	and abruptly.
 11511	
 11512	All were silent. TÃºshin appeared at the threshold and made his way
 11513	timidly from behind the backs of the generals. As he stepped past the
 11514	generals in the crowded hut, feeling embarrassed as he always was by the
 11515	sight of his superiors, he did not notice the staff of the banner and
 11516	stumbled over it. Several of those present laughed.
 11517	
 11518	âHow was it a gun was abandoned?â asked BagratiÃ³n, frowning, not so
 11519	much at the captain as at those who were laughing, among whom ZherkÃ³v
 11520	laughed loudest.
 11521	
 11522	Only now, when he was confronted by the stern authorities, did his guilt
 11523	and the disgrace of having lost two guns and yet remaining alive present
 11524	themselves to TÃºshin in all their horror. He had been so excited that
 11525	he had not thought about it until that moment. The officersâ laughter
 11526	confused him still more. He stood before BagratiÃ³n with his lower
 11527	jaw trembling and was hardly able to mutter: âI donât know... your
 11528	excellency... I had no men... your excellency.â
 11529	
 11530	âYou might have taken some from the covering troops.â
 11531	
 11532	TÃºshin did not say that there were no covering troops, though that
 11533	was perfectly true. He was afraid of getting some other officer into
 11534	trouble, and silently fixed his eyes on BagratiÃ³n as a schoolboy who
 11535	has blundered looks at an examiner.
 11536	
 11537	The silence lasted some time. Prince BagratiÃ³n, apparently not wishing
 11538	to be severe, found nothing to say; the others did not venture to
 11539	intervene. Prince Andrew looked at TÃºshin from under his brows and his
 11540	fingers twitched nervously.
 11541	
 11542	âYour excellency!â Prince Andrew broke the silence with his abrupt
 11543	voice, âyou were pleased to send me to Captain TÃºshinâs battery. I
 11544	went there and found two thirds of the men and horses knocked out, two
 11545	guns smashed, and no supports at all.â
 11546	
 11547	Prince BagratiÃ³n and TÃºshin looked with equal intentness at
 11548	BolkÃ³nski, who spoke with suppressed agitation.
 11549	
 11550	âAnd, if your excellency will allow me to express my opinion,â he
 11551	continued, âwe owe todayâs success chiefly to the action of that
 11552	battery and the heroic endurance of Captain TÃºshin and his company,â
 11553	and without awaiting a reply, Prince Andrew rose and left the table.
 11554	
 11555	Prince BagratiÃ³n looked at TÃºshin, evidently reluctant to show
 11556	distrust in BolkÃ³nskiâs emphatic opinion yet not feeling able fully
 11557	to credit it, bent his head, and told TÃºshin that he could go. Prince
 11558	Andrew went out with him.
 11559	
 11560	âThank you; you saved me, my dear fellow!â said TÃºshin.
 11561	
 11562	Prince Andrew gave him a look, but said nothing and went away. He felt
 11563	sad and depressed. It was all so strange, so unlike what he had hoped.
 11564	
 11565	
 11566	âWho are they? Why are they here? What do they want? And when will
 11567	all this end?â thought RostÃ³v, looking at the changing shadows before
 11568	him. The pain in his arm became more and more intense. Irresistible
 11569	drowsiness overpowered him, red rings danced before his eyes, and the
 11570	impression of those voices and faces and a sense of loneliness merged
 11571	with the physical pain. It was they, these soldiersâwounded and
 11572	unwoundedâit was they who were crushing, weighing down, and twisting
 11573	the sinews and scorching the flesh of his sprained arm and shoulder. To
 11574	rid himself of them he closed his eyes.
 11575	
 11576	For a moment he dozed, but in that short interval innumerable things
 11577	appeared to him in a dream: his mother and her large white hand,
 11578	SÃ³nyaâs thin little shoulders, NatÃ¡shaâs eyes and laughter,
 11579	DenÃ­sov with his voice and mustache, and TelyÃ¡nin and all that affair
 11580	with TelyÃ¡nin and BogdÃ¡nich. That affair was the same thing as this
 11581	soldier with the harsh voice, and it was that affair and this soldier
 11582	that were so agonizingly, incessantly pulling and pressing his arm and
 11583	always dragging it in one direction. He tried to get away from them, but
 11584	they would not for an instant let his shoulder move a hairâs breadth.
 11585	It would not acheâit would be wellâif only they did not pull it, but
 11586	it was impossible to get rid of them.
 11587	
 11588	He opened his eyes and looked up. The black canopy of night hung less
 11589	than a yard above the glow of the charcoal. Flakes of falling snow were
 11590	fluttering in that light. TÃºshin had not returned, the doctor had not
 11591	come. He was alone now, except for a soldier who was sitting naked at
 11592	the other side of the fire, warming his thin yellow body.
 11593	
 11594	âNobody wants me!â thought RostÃ³v. âThere is no one to help me or
 11595	pity me. Yet I was once at home, strong, happy, and loved.â He sighed
 11596	and, doing so, groaned involuntarily.
 11597	
 11598	âEh, is anything hurting you?â asked the soldier, shaking his shirt
 11599	out over the fire, and not waiting for an answer he gave a grunt and
 11600	added: âWhat a lot of men have been crippled todayâfrightful!â
 11601	
 11602	RostÃ³v did not listen to the soldier. He looked at the snowflakes
 11603	fluttering above the fire and remembered a Russian winter at his warm,
 11604	bright home, his fluffy fur coat, his quickly gliding sleigh, his
 11605	healthy body, and all the affection and care of his family. âAnd why
 11606	did I come here?â he wondered.
 11607	
 11608	Next day the French army did not renew their attack, and the remnant of
 11609	BagratiÃ³nâs detachment was reunited to KutÃºzovâs army.

 11621	CHAPTER I
 11622	
 11623	Prince VasÃ­li was not a man who deliberately thought out his plans.
 11624	Still less did he think of injuring anyone for his own advantage. He
 11625	was merely a man of the world who had got on and to whom getting on had
 11626	become a habit. Schemes and devices for which he never rightly accounted
 11627	to himself, but which formed the whole interest of his life,
 11628	were constantly shaping themselves in his mind, arising from the
 11629	circumstances and persons he met. Of these plans he had not merely one
 11630	or two in his head but dozens, some only beginning to form themselves,
 11631	some approaching achievement, and some in course of disintegration. He
 11632	did not, for instance, say to himself: âThis man now has influence, I
 11633	must gain his confidence and friendship and through him obtain a special
 11634	grant.â Nor did he say to himself: âPierre is a rich man, I must
 11635	entice him to marry my daughter and lend me the forty thousand rubles
 11636	I need.â But when he came across a man of position his instinct
 11637	immediately told him that this man could be useful, and without any
 11638	premeditation Prince VasÃ­li took the first opportunity to gain his
 11639	confidence, flatter him, become intimate with him, and finally make his
 11640	request.
 11641	
 11642	He had Pierre at hand in Moscow and procured for him an appointment as
 11643	Gentleman of the Bedchamber, which at that time conferred the status of
 11644	Councilor of State, and insisted on the young man accompanying him to
 11645	Petersburg and staying at his house. With apparent absent-mindedness,
 11646	yet with unhesitating assurance that he was doing the right thing,
 11647	Prince VasÃ­li did everything to get Pierre to marry his daughter. Had
 11648	he thought out his plans beforehand he could not have been so natural
 11649	and shown such unaffected familiarity in intercourse with everybody both
 11650	above and below him in social standing. Something always drew him toward
 11651	those richer and more powerful than himself and he had rare skill in
 11652	seizing the most opportune moment for making use of people.
 11653	
 11654	Pierre, on unexpectedly becoming Count BezÃºkhov and a rich man, felt
 11655	himself after his recent loneliness and freedom from cares so beset and
 11656	preoccupied that only in bed was he able to be by himself. He had to
 11657	sign papers, to present himself at government offices, the purpose of
 11658	which was not clear to him, to question his chief steward, to visit his
 11659	estate near Moscow, and to receive many people who formerly did not
 11660	even wish to know of his existence but would now have been offended
 11661	and grieved had he chosen not to see them. These different
 11662	peopleâbusinessmen, relations, and acquaintances alikeâwere all
 11663	disposed to treat the young heir in the most friendly and flattering
 11664	manner: they were all evidently firmly convinced of Pierreâs noble
 11665	qualities. He was always hearing such words as: âWith your remarkable
 11666	kindness,â or, âWith your excellent heart,â âYou are yourself so
 11667	honorable, Count,â or, âWere he as clever as you,â and so on,
 11668	till he began sincerely to believe in his own exceptional kindness and
 11669	extraordinary intelligence, the more so as in the depth of his heart it
 11670	had always seemed to him that he really was very kind and intelligent.
 11671	Even people who had formerly been spiteful toward him and evidently
 11672	unfriendly now became gentle and affectionate. The angry eldest
 11673	princess, with the long waist and hair plastered down like a dollâs,
 11674	had come into Pierreâs room after the funeral. With drooping eyes
 11675	and frequent blushes she told him she was very sorry about their past
 11676	misunderstandings and did not now feel she had a right to ask him for
 11677	anything, except only for permission, after the blow she had received,
 11678	to remain for a few weeks longer in the house she so loved and where
 11679	she had sacrificed so much. She could not refrain from weeping at these
 11680	words. Touched that this statuesque princess could so change, Pierre
 11681	took her hand and begged her forgiveness, without knowing what for.
 11682	From that day the eldest princess quite changed toward Pierre and began
 11683	knitting a striped scarf for him.
 11684	
 11685	âDo this for my sake, mon cher; after all, she had to put up with a
 11686	great deal from the deceased,â said Prince VasÃ­li to him, handing him
 11687	a deed to sign for the princessâ benefit.
 11688	
 11689	Prince VasÃ­li had come to the conclusion that it was necessary to throw
 11690	this boneâa bill for thirty thousand rublesâto the poor princess
 11691	that it might not occur to her to speak of his share in the affair of
 11692	the inlaid portfolio. Pierre signed the deed and after that the princess
 11693	grew still kinder. The younger sisters also became affectionate to him,
 11694	especially the youngest, the pretty one with the mole, who often made
 11695	him feel confused by her smiles and her own confusion when meeting him.
 11696	
 11697	It seemed so natural to Pierre that everyone should like him, and it
 11698	would have seemed so unnatural had anyone disliked him, that he could
 11699	not but believe in the sincerity of those around him. Besides, he had
 11700	no time to ask himself whether these people were sincere or not. He
 11701	was always busy and always felt in a state of mild and cheerful
 11702	intoxication. He felt as though he were the center of some important and
 11703	general movement; that something was constantly expected of him, that if
 11704	he did not do it he would grieve and disappoint many people, but if he
 11705	did this and that, all would be well; and he did what was demanded of
 11706	him, but still that happy result always remained in the future.
 11707	
 11708	More than anyone else, Prince VasÃ­li took possession of Pierreâs
 11709	affairs and of Pierre himself in those early days. From the death of
 11710	Count BezÃºkhov he did not let go his hold of the lad. He had the air of
 11711	a man oppressed by business, weary and suffering, who yet would not, for
 11712	pityâs sake, leave this helpless youth who, after all, was the son of
 11713	his old friend and the possessor of such enormous wealth, to the caprice
 11714	of fate and the designs of rogues. During the few days he spent in
 11715	Moscow after the death of Count BezÃºkhov, he would call Pierre, or
 11716	go to him himself, and tell him what ought to be done in a tone of
 11717	weariness and assurance, as if he were adding every time: âYou know
 11718	I am overwhelmed with business and it is purely out of charity that
 11719	I trouble myself about you, and you also know quite well that what I
 11720	propose is the only thing possible.â
 11721	
 11722	âWell, my dear fellow, tomorrow we are off at last,â said Prince
 11723	VasÃ­li one day, closing his eyes and fingering Pierreâs elbow,
 11724	speaking as if he were saying something which had long since been agreed
 11725	upon and could not now be altered. âWe start tomorrow and Iâm giving
 11726	you a place in my carriage. I am very glad. All our important business
 11727	here is now settled, and I ought to have been off long ago. Here is
 11728	something I have received from the chancellor. I asked him for you, and
 11729	you have been entered in the diplomatic corps and made a Gentleman of
 11730	the Bedchamber. The diplomatic career now lies open before you.â
 11731	
 11732	Notwithstanding the tone of wearied assurance with which these words
 11733	were pronounced, Pierre, who had so long been considering his career,
 11734	wished to make some suggestion. But Prince VasÃ­li interrupted him in
 11735	the special deep cooing tone, precluding the possibility of interrupting
 11736	his speech, which he used in extreme cases when special persuasion was
 11737	needed.
 11738	
 11739	âMais, mon cher, I did this for my own sake, to satisfy my conscience,
 11740	and there is nothing to thank me for. No one has ever complained yet of
 11741	being too much loved; and besides, you are free, you could throw it
 11742	up tomorrow. But you will see everything for yourself when you get to
 11743	Petersburg. It is high time for you to get away from these terrible
 11744	recollections.â Prince VasÃ­li sighed. âYes, yes, my boy. And my
 11745	valet can go in your carriage. Ah! I was nearly forgetting,â he added.
 11746	âYou know, mon cher, your father and I had some accounts to settle, so
 11747	I have received what was due from the RyazÃ¡n estate and will keep it;
 11748	you wonât require it. Weâll go into the accounts later.â
 11749	
 11750	By âwhat was due from the RyazÃ¡n estateâ Prince VasÃ­li meant
 11751	several thousand rubles quitrent received from Pierreâs peasants,
 11752	which the prince had retained for himself.
 11753	
 11754	In Petersburg, as in Moscow, Pierre found the same atmosphere of
 11755	gentleness and affection. He could not refuse the post, or rather the
 11756	rank (for he did nothing), that Prince VasÃ­li had procured for him,
 11757	and acquaintances, invitations, and social occupations were so numerous
 11758	that, even more than in Moscow, he felt a sense of bewilderment, bustle,
 11759	and continual expectation of some good, always in front of him but never
 11760	attained.
 11761	
 11762	Of his former bachelor acquaintances many were no longer in Petersburg.
 11763	The Guards had gone to the front; DÃ³lokhov had been reduced to the
 11764	ranks; Anatole was in the army somewhere in the provinces; Prince Andrew
 11765	was abroad; so Pierre had not the opportunity to spend his nights as he
 11766	used to like to spend them, or to open his mind by intimate talks with
 11767	a friend older than himself and whom he respected. His whole time
 11768	was taken up with dinners and balls and was spent chiefly at Prince
 11769	VasÃ­liâs house in the company of the stout princess, his wife, and
 11770	his beautiful daughter HÃ©lÃ¨ne.
 11771	
 11772	Like the others, Anna PÃ¡vlovna SchÃ©rer showed Pierre the change of
 11773	attitude toward him that had taken place in society.
 11774	
 11775	Formerly in Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs presence, Pierre had always felt that
 11776	what he was saying was out of place, tactless and unsuitable, that
 11777	remarks which seemed to him clever while they formed in his mind became
 11778	foolish as soon as he uttered them, while on the contrary Hippolyteâs
 11779	stupidest remarks came out clever and apt. Now everything Pierre said
 11780	was charmant. Even if Anna PÃ¡vlovna did not say so, he could see that
 11781	she wished to and only refrained out of regard for his modesty.
 11782	
 11783	In the beginning of the winter of 1805-6 Pierre received one of Anna
 11784	PÃ¡vlovnaâs usual pink notes with an invitation to which was added:
 11785	âYou will find the beautiful HÃ©lÃ¨ne here, whom it is always
 11786	delightful to see.â
 11787	
 11788	When he read that sentence, Pierre felt for the first time that some
 11789	link which other people recognized had grown up between himself and
 11790	HÃ©lÃ¨ne, and that thought both alarmed him, as if some obligation were
 11791	being imposed on him which he could not fulfill, and pleased him as an
 11792	entertaining supposition.
 11793	
 11794	Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs âAt Homeâ was like the former one, only the
 11795	novelty she offered her guests this time was not Mortemart, but a
 11796	diplomatist fresh from Berlin with the very latest details of the
 11797	Emperor Alexanderâs visit to Potsdam, and of how the two august
 11798	friends had pledged themselves in an indissoluble alliance to uphold
 11799	the cause of justice against the enemy of the human race. Anna PÃ¡vlovna
 11800	received Pierre with a shade of melancholy, evidently relating to the
 11801	young manâs recent loss by the death of Count BezÃºkhov (everyone
 11802	constantly considered it a duty to assure Pierre that he was greatly
 11803	afflicted by the death of the father he had hardly known), and her
 11804	melancholy was just like the august melancholy she showed at the mention
 11805	of her most august Majesty the Empress MÃ¡rya FÃ«dorovna. Pierre felt
 11806	flattered by this. Anna PÃ¡vlovna arranged the different groups in her
 11807	drawing room with her habitual skill. The large group, in which were
 11808	Prince VasÃ­li and the generals, had the benefit of the diplomat.
 11809	Another group was at the tea table. Pierre wished to join the former,
 11810	but Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâwho was in the excited condition of a commander on
 11811	a battlefield to whom thousands of new and brilliant ideas occur which
 11812	there is hardly time to put in actionâseeing Pierre, touched his
 11813	sleeve with her finger, saying:
 11814	
 11815	âWait a bit, I have something in view for you this evening.â
 11816	(She glanced at HÃ©lÃ¨ne and smiled at her.) âMy dear HÃ©lÃ¨ne, be
 11817	charitable to my poor aunt who adores you. Go and keep her company for
 11818	ten minutes. And that it will not be too dull, here is the dear count
 11819	who will not refuse to accompany you.â
 11820	
 11821	The beauty went to the aunt, but Anna PÃ¡vlovna detained Pierre, looking
 11822	as if she had to give some final necessary instructions.
 11823	
 11824	âIsnât she exquisite?â she said to Pierre, pointing to the stately
 11825	beauty as she glided away. âAnd how she carries herself! For so young
 11826	a girl, such tact, such masterly perfection of manner! It comes from
 11827	her heart. Happy the man who wins her! With her the least worldly of men
 11828	would occupy a most brilliant position in society. Donât you think so?
 11829	I only wanted to know your opinion,â and Anna PÃ¡vlovna let Pierre go.
 11830	
 11831	Pierre, in reply, sincerely agreed with her as to HÃ©lÃ¨neâs
 11832	perfection of manner. If he ever thought of HÃ©lÃ¨ne, it was just of
 11833	her beauty and her remarkable skill in appearing silently dignified in
 11834	society.
 11835	
 11836	The old aunt received the two young people in her corner, but seemed
 11837	desirous of hiding her adoration for HÃ©lÃ¨ne and inclined rather
 11838	to show her fear of Anna PÃ¡vlovna. She looked at her niece, as if
 11839	inquiring what she was to do with these people. On leaving them, Anna
 11840	PÃ¡vlovna again touched Pierreâs sleeve, saying: âI hope you wonât
 11841	say that it is dull in my house again,â and she glanced at HÃ©lÃ¨ne.
 11842	
 11843	HÃ©lÃ¨ne smiled, with a look implying that she did not admit the
 11844	possibility of anyone seeing her without being enchanted. The aunt
 11845	coughed, swallowed, and said in French that she was very pleased to see
 11846	HÃ©lÃ¨ne, then she turned to Pierre with the same words of welcome
 11847	and the same look. In the middle of a dull and halting conversation,
 11848	HÃ©lÃ¨ne turned to Pierre with the beautiful bright smile that she gave
 11849	to everyone. Pierre was so used to that smile, and it had so little
 11850	meaning for him, that he paid no attention to it. The aunt was just
 11851	speaking of a collection of snuffboxes that had belonged to Pierreâs
 11852	father, Count BezÃºkhov, and showed them her own box. Princess HÃ©lÃ¨ne
 11853	asked to see the portrait of the auntâs husband on the box lid.
 11854	
 11855	âThat is probably the work of Vinesse,â said Pierre, mentioning
 11856	a celebrated miniaturist, and he leaned over the table to take the
 11857	snuffbox while trying to hear what was being said at the other table.
 11858	
 11859	He half rose, meaning to go round, but the aunt handed him the snuffbox,
 11860	passing it across HÃ©lÃ¨neâs back. HÃ©lÃ¨ne stooped forward to make
 11861	room, and looked round with a smile. She was, as always at evening
 11862	parties, wearing a dress such as was then fashionable, cut very low at
 11863	front and back. Her bust, which had always seemed like marble to Pierre,
 11864	was so close to him that his shortsighted eyes could not but perceive
 11865	the living charm of her neck and shoulders, so near to his lips that
 11866	he need only have bent his head a little to have touched them. He was
 11867	conscious of the warmth of her body, the scent of perfume, and the
 11868	creaking of her corset as she moved. He did not see her marble beauty
 11869	forming a complete whole with her dress, but all the charm of her body
 11870	only covered by her garments. And having once seen this he could not
 11871	help being aware of it, just as we cannot renew an illusion we have once
 11872	seen through.
 11873	
 11874	âSo you have never noticed before how beautiful I am?â HÃ©lÃ¨ne
 11875	seemed to say. âYou had not noticed that I am a woman? Yes, I am a
 11876	woman who may belong to anyoneâto you too,â said her glance. And at
 11877	that moment Pierre felt that HÃ©lÃ¨ne not only could, but must, be his
 11878	wife, and that it could not be otherwise.
 11879	
 11880	He knew this at that moment as surely as if he had been standing at the
 11881	altar with her. How and when this would be he did not know, he did not
 11882	even know if it would be a good thing (he even felt, he knew not why,
 11883	that it would be a bad thing), but he knew it would happen.
 11884	
 11885	Pierre dropped his eyes, lifted them again, and wished once more to see
 11886	her as a distant beauty far removed from him, as he had seen her every
 11887	day until then, but he could no longer do it. He could not, any more
 11888	than a man who has been looking at a tuft of steppe grass through the
 11889	mist and taking it for a tree can again take it for a tree after he has
 11890	once recognized it to be a tuft of grass. She was terribly close to him.
 11891	She already had power over him, and between them there was no longer any
 11892	barrier except the barrier of his own will.
 11893	
 11894	âWell, I will leave you in your little corner,â came Anna
 11895	PÃ¡vlovnaâs voice, âI see you are all right there.â
 11896	
 11897	And Pierre, anxiously trying to remember whether he had done anything
 11898	reprehensible, looked round with a blush. It seemed to him that everyone
 11899	knew what had happened to him as he knew it himself.
 11900	
 11901	A little later when he went up to the large circle, Anna PÃ¡vlovna said
 11902	to him: âI hear you are refitting your Petersburg house?â
 11903	
 11904	This was true. The architect had told him that it was necessary, and
 11905	Pierre, without knowing why, was having his enormous Petersburg house
 11906	done up.
 11907	
 11908	âThatâs a good thing, but donât move from Prince VasÃ­liâs. It
 11909	is good to have a friend like the prince,â she said, smiling at Prince
 11910	VasÃ­li. âI know something about that. Donât I? And you are still so
 11911	young. You need advice. Donât be angry with me for exercising an old
 11912	womanâs privilege.â
 11913	
 11914	She paused, as women always do, expecting something after they have
 11915	mentioned their age. âIf you marry it will be a different thing,â
 11916	she continued, uniting them both in one glance. Pierre did not look at
 11917	HÃ©lÃ¨ne nor she at him. But she was just as terribly close to him. He
 11918	muttered something and colored.
 11919	
 11920	When he got home he could not sleep for a long time for thinking of what
 11921	had happened. What had happened? Nothing. He had merely understood that
 11922	the woman he had known as a child, of whom when her beauty was mentioned
 11923	he had said absent-mindedly: âYes, sheâs good looking,â he had
 11924	understood that this woman might belong to him.
 11925	
 11926	âBut sheâs stupid. I have myself said she is stupid,â he thought.
 11927	âThere is something nasty, something wrong, in the feeling she excites
 11928	in me. I have been told that her brother Anatole was in love with her
 11929	and she with him, that there was quite a scandal and that thatâs why
 11930	he was sent away. Hippolyte is her brother... Prince VasÃ­li is her
 11931	father... Itâs bad....â he reflected, but while he was thinking this
 11932	(the reflection was still incomplete), he caught himself smiling and was
 11933	conscious that another line of thought had sprung up, and while thinking
 11934	of her worthlessness he was also dreaming of how she would be his
 11935	wife, how she would love him become quite different, and how all he had
 11936	thought and heard of her might be false. And he again saw her not as the
 11937	daughter of Prince VasÃ­li, but visualized her whole body only veiled
 11938	by its gray dress. âBut no! Why did this thought never occur to me
 11939	before?â and again he told himself that it was impossible, that there
 11940	would be something unnatural, and as it seemed to him dishonorable, in
 11941	this marriage. He recalled her former words and looks and the words
 11942	and looks of those who had seen them together. He recalled Anna
 11943	PÃ¡vlovnaâs words and looks when she spoke to him about his house,
 11944	recalled thousands of such hints from Prince VasÃ­li and others, and was
 11945	seized by terror lest he had already, in some way, bound himself to do
 11946	something that was evidently wrong and that he ought not to do. But at
 11947	the very time he was expressing this conviction to himself, in another
 11948	part of his mind her image rose in all its womanly beauty.
 11949

 11954	CHAPTER II
 11955	
 11956	In November, 1805, Prince VasÃ­li had to go on a tour of inspection
 11957	in four different provinces. He had arranged this for himself so as to
 11958	visit his neglected estates at the same time and pick up his son Anatole
 11959	where his regiment was stationed, and take him to visit Prince Nicholas
 11960	BolkÃ³nski in order to arrange a match for him with the daughter of that
 11961	rich old man. But before leaving home and undertaking these new affairs,
 11962	Prince VasÃ­li had to settle matters with Pierre, who, it is true, had
 11963	latterly spent whole days at home, that is, in Prince VasÃ­liâs house
 11964	where he was staying, and had been absurd, excited, and foolish in
 11965	HÃ©lÃ¨neâs presence (as a lover should be), but had not yet proposed
 11966	to her.
 11967	
 11968	âThis is all very fine, but things must be settled,â said Prince
 11969	VasÃ­li to himself, with a sorrowful sigh, one morning, feeling that
 11970	Pierre who was under such obligations to him (âBut never mind thatâ)
 11971	was not behaving very well in this matter. âYouth, frivolity... well,
 11972	God be with him,â thought he, relishing his own goodness of heart,
 11973	âbut it must be brought to a head. The day after tomorrow will be
 11974	LÃ«lyaâs name day. I will invite two or three people, and if he does
 11975	not understand what he ought to do then it will be my affairâyes, my
 11976	affair. I am her father.â
 11977	
 11978	Six weeks after Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs âAt Homeâ and after the sleepless
 11979	night when he had decided that to marry HÃ©lÃ¨ne would be a calamity and
 11980	that he ought to avoid her and go away, Pierre, despite that decision,
 11981	had not left Prince VasÃ­liâs and felt with terror that in peopleâs
 11982	eyes he was every day more and more connected with her, that it was
 11983	impossible for him to return to his former conception of her, that he
 11984	could not break away from her, and that though it would be a terrible
 11985	thing he would have to unite his fate with hers. He might perhaps have
 11986	been able to free himself but that Prince VasÃ­li (who had rarely before
 11987	given receptions) now hardly let a day go by without having an evening
 11988	party at which Pierre had to be present unless he wished to spoil
 11989	the general pleasure and disappoint everyoneâs expectation. Prince
 11990	VasÃ­li, in the rare moments when he was at home, would take Pierreâs
 11991	hand in passing and draw it downwards, or absent-mindedly hold out his
 11992	wrinkled, clean-shaven cheek for Pierre to kiss and would say: âTill
 11993	tomorrow,â or, âBe in to dinner or I shall not see you,â or, âI
 11994	am staying in for your sake,â and so on. And though Prince VasÃ­li,
 11995	when he stayed in (as he said) for Pierreâs sake, hardly exchanged a
 11996	couple of words with him, Pierre felt unable to disappoint him.
 11997	Every day he said to himself one and the same thing: âIt is time I
 11998	understood her and made up my mind what she really is. Was I mistaken
 11999	before, or am I mistaken now? No, she is not stupid, she is an excellent
 12000	girl,â he sometimes said to himself âshe never makes a mistake,
 12001	never says anything stupid. She says little, but what she does say is
 12002	always clear and simple, so she is not stupid. She never was abashed and
 12003	is not abashed now, so she cannot be a bad woman!â He had often begun
 12004	to make reflections or think aloud in her company, and she had always
 12005	answered him either by a brief but appropriate remarkâshowing that it
 12006	did not interest herâor by a silent look and smile which more palpably
 12007	than anything else showed Pierre her superiority. She was right in
 12008	regarding all arguments as nonsense in comparison with that smile.
 12009	
 12010	She always addressed him with a radiantly confiding smile meant for him
 12011	alone, in which there was something more significant than in the general
 12012	smile that usually brightened her face. Pierre knew that everyone was
 12013	waiting for him to say a word and cross a certain line, and he knew that
 12014	sooner or later he would step across it, but an incomprehensible terror
 12015	seized him at the thought of that dreadful step. A thousand times during
 12016	that month and a half while he felt himself drawn nearer and nearer to
 12017	that dreadful abyss, Pierre said to himself: âWhat am I doing? I need
 12018	resolution. Can it be that I have none?â
 12019	
 12020	He wished to take a decision, but felt with dismay that in this matter
 12021	he lacked that strength of will which he had known in himself and really
 12022	possessed. Pierre was one of those who are only strong when they feel
 12023	themselves quite innocent, and since that day when he was overpowered
 12024	by a feeling of desire while stooping over the snuffbox at Anna
 12025	PÃ¡vlovnaâs, an unacknowledged sense of the guilt of that desire
 12026	paralyzed his will.
 12027	
 12028	On HÃ©lÃ¨neâs name day, a small party of just their own peopleâas
 12029	his wife saidâmet for supper at Prince VasÃ­liâs. All these friends
 12030	and relations had been given to understand that the fate of the young
 12031	girl would be decided that evening. The visitors were seated at supper.
 12032	Princess KurÃ¡gina, a portly imposing woman who had once been handsome,
 12033	was sitting at the head of the table. On either side of her sat the
 12034	more important guestsâan old general and his wife, and Anna PÃ¡vlovna
 12035	SchÃ©rer. At the other end sat the younger and less important guests,
 12036	and there too sat the members of the family, and Pierre and HÃ©lÃ¨ne,
 12037	side by side. Prince VasÃ­li was not having any supper: he went round
 12038	the table in a merry mood, sitting down now by one, now by another, of
 12039	the guests. To each of them he made some careless and agreeable remark
 12040	except to Pierre and HÃ©lÃ¨ne, whose presence he seemed not to notice.
 12041	He enlivened the whole party. The wax candles burned brightly, the
 12042	silver and crystal gleamed, so did the ladiesâ toilets and the gold
 12043	and silver of the menâs epaulets; servants in scarlet liveries moved
 12044	round the table, the clatter of plates, knives, and glasses mingled with
 12045	the animated hum of several conversations. At one end of the table, the
 12046	old chamberlain was heard assuring an old baroness that he loved her
 12047	passionately, at which she laughed; at the other could be heard the
 12048	story of the misfortunes of some Mary VÃ­ktorovna or other. At the
 12049	center of the table, Prince VasÃ­li attracted everybodyâs attention.
 12050	With a facetious smile on his face, he was telling the ladies about last
 12051	Wednesdayâs meeting of the Imperial Council, at which SergÃ©y KuzmÃ­ch
 12052	VyazmÃ­tinov, the new military governor general of Petersburg, had
 12053	received and read the then famous rescript of the Emperor Alexander
 12054	from the army to SergÃ©y KuzmÃ­ch, in which the Emperor said that he was
 12055	receiving from all sides declarations of the peopleâs loyalty, that
 12056	the declaration from Petersburg gave him particular pleasure, and that
 12057	he was proud to be at the head of such a nation and would endeavor to be
 12058	worthy of it. This rescript began with the words: âSergÃ©y KuzmÃ­ch,
 12059	From all sides reports reach me,â etc.
 12060	
 12061	âWell, and so he never got farther than: âSergÃ©y KuzmÃ­châ?â
 12062	asked one of the ladies.
 12063	
 12064	âExactly, not a hairâs breadth farther,â answered Prince VasÃ­li,
 12065	laughing, ââSergÃ©y KuzmÃ­ch... From all sides... From all sides...
 12066	SergÃ©y KuzmÃ­ch...â Poor VyazmÃ­tinov could not get any farther!
 12067	He began the rescript again and again, but as soon as he uttered
 12068	âSergÃ©yâ he sobbed, âKuz-mÃ­-ch,â tears, and âFrom all
 12069	sidesâ was smothered in sobs and he could get no farther. And again
 12070	his handkerchief, and again: âSergÃ©y KuzmÃ­ch, From all sides,â...
 12071	and tears, till at last somebody else was asked to read it.â
 12072	
 12073	âKuzmÃ­ch... From all sides... and then tears,â someone repeated
 12074	laughing.
 12075	
 12076	âDonât be unkind,â cried Anna PÃ¡vlovna from her end of the table
 12077	holding up a threatening finger. âHe is such a worthy and excellent
 12078	man, our dear VyazmÃ­tinov....â
 12079	
 12080	Everybody laughed a great deal. At the head of the table, where the
 12081	honored guests sat, everyone seemed to be in high spirits and under the
 12082	influence of a variety of exciting sensations. Only Pierre and
 12083	HÃ©lÃ¨ne sat silently side by side almost at the bottom of the table, a
 12084	suppressed smile brightening both their faces, a smile that had nothing
 12085	to do with SergÃ©y KuzmÃ­châa smile of bashfulness at their own
 12086	feelings. But much as all the rest laughed, talked, and joked, much
 12087	as they enjoyed their Rhine wine, sautÃ©, and ices, and however they
 12088	avoided looking at the young couple, and heedless and unobservant as
 12089	they seemed of them, one could feel by the occasional glances they gave
 12090	that the story about SergÃ©y KuzmÃ­ch, the laughter, and the food
 12091	were all a pretense, and that the whole attention of that company was
 12092	directed toâPierre and HÃ©lÃ¨ne. Prince VasÃ­li mimicked the sobbing
 12093	of SergÃ©y KuzmÃ­ch and at the same time his eyes glanced toward his
 12094	daughter, and while he laughed the expression on his face clearly said:
 12095	âYes... itâs getting on, it will all be settled today.â Anna
 12096	PÃ¡vlovna threatened him on behalf of âour dear VyazmÃ­tinov,â and
 12097	in her eyes, which, for an instant, glanced at Pierre, Prince VasÃ­li
 12098	read a congratulation on his future son-in-law and on his daughterâs
 12099	happiness. The old princess sighed sadly as she offered some wine to the
 12100	old lady next to her and glanced angrily at her daughter, and her sigh
 12101	seemed to say: âYes, thereâs nothing left for you and me but to sip
 12102	sweet wine, my dear, now that the time has come for these young ones to
 12103	be thus boldly, provocatively happy.â âAnd what nonsense all this is
 12104	that I am saying!â thought a diplomatist, glancing at the happy faces
 12105	of the lovers. âThatâs happiness!â
 12106	
 12107	Into the insignificant, trifling, and artificial interests uniting that
 12108	society had entered the simple feeling of the attraction of a healthy
 12109	and handsome young man and woman for one another. And this human feeling
 12110	dominated everything else and soared above all their affected chatter.
 12111	Jests fell flat, news was not interesting, and the animation was
 12112	evidently forced. Not only the guests but even the footmen waiting at
 12113	table seemed to feel this, and they forgot their duties as they looked
 12114	at the beautiful HÃ©lÃ¨ne with her radiant face and at the red, broad,
 12115	and happy though uneasy face of Pierre. It seemed as if the very light
 12116	of the candles was focused on those two happy faces alone.
 12117	
 12118	Pierre felt that he was the center of it all, and this both pleased and
 12119	embarrassed him. He was like a man entirely absorbed in some occupation.
 12120	He did not see, hear, or understand anything clearly. Only now and
 12121	then detached ideas and impressions from the world of reality shot
 12122	unexpectedly through his mind.
 12123	
 12124	âSo it is all finished!â he thought. âAnd how has it all happened?
 12125	How quickly! Now I know that not because of her alone, nor of myself
 12126	alone, but because of everyone, it must inevitably come about. They are
 12127	all expecting it, they are so sure that it will happen that I cannot, I
 12128	cannot, disappoint them. But how will it be? I do not know, but it
 12129	will certainly happen!â thought Pierre, glancing at those dazzling
 12130	shoulders close to his eyes.
 12131	
 12132	Or he would suddenly feel ashamed of he knew not what. He felt it
 12133	awkward to attract everyoneâs attention and to be considered a
 12134	lucky man and, with his plain face, to be looked on as a sort of Paris
 12135	possessed of a Helen. âBut no doubt it always is and must be so!â
 12136	he consoled himself. âAnd besides, what have I done to bring it about?
 12137	How did it begin? I traveled from Moscow with Prince VasÃ­li. Then there
 12138	was nothing. So why should I not stay at his house? Then I played cards
 12139	with her and picked up her reticule and drove out with her. How did it
 12140	begin, when did it all come about?â And here he was sitting by her
 12141	side as her betrothed, seeing, hearing, feeling her nearness, her
 12142	breathing, her movements, her beauty. Then it would suddenly seem to him
 12143	that it was not she but he was so unusually beautiful, and that that was
 12144	why they all looked so at him, and flattered by this general admiration
 12145	he would expand his chest, raise his head, and rejoice at his good
 12146	fortune. Suddenly he heard a familiar voice repeating something to him a
 12147	second time. But Pierre was so absorbed that he did not understand what
 12148	was said.
 12149	
 12150	âI am asking you when you last heard from BolkÃ³nski,â repeated
 12151	Prince VasÃ­li a third time. âHow absent-minded you are, my dear
 12152	fellow.â
 12153	
 12154	Prince VasÃ­li smiled, and Pierre noticed that everyone was smiling at
 12155	him and HÃ©lÃ¨ne. âWell, what of it, if you all know it?â thought
 12156	Pierre. âWhat of it? Itâs the truth!â and he himself smiled his
 12157	gentle childlike smile, and HÃ©lÃ¨ne smiled too.
 12158	
 12159	âWhen did you get the letter? Was it from OlmÃ¼tz?â repeated
 12160	Prince VasÃ­li, who pretended to want to know this in order to settle a
 12161	dispute.
 12162	
 12163	âHow can one talk or think of such trifles?â thought Pierre.
 12164	
 12165	âYes, from OlmÃ¼tz,â he answered, with a sigh.
 12166	
 12167	After supper Pierre with his partner followed the others into the
 12168	drawing room. The guests began to disperse, some without taking leave
 12169	of HÃ©lÃ¨ne. Some, as if unwilling to distract her from an important
 12170	occupation, came up to her for a moment and made haste to go away,
 12171	refusing to let her see them off. The diplomatist preserved a mournful
 12172	silence as he left the drawing room. He pictured the vanity of his
 12173	diplomatic career in comparison with Pierreâs happiness. The old
 12174	general grumbled at his wife when she asked how his leg was. âOh, the
 12175	old fool,â he thought. âThat Princess HÃ©lÃ¨ne will be beautiful
 12176	still when sheâs fifty.â
 12177	
 12178	âI think I may congratulate you,â whispered Anna PÃ¡vlovna to the
 12179	old princess, kissing her soundly. âIf I hadnât this headache Iâd
 12180	have stayed longer.â
 12181	
 12182	The old princess did not reply, she was tormented by jealousy of her
 12183	daughterâs happiness.
 12184	
 12185	While the guests were taking their leave Pierre remained for a long time
 12186	alone with HÃ©lÃ¨ne in the little drawing room where they were sitting.
 12187	He had often before, during the last six weeks, remained alone with her,
 12188	but had never spoken to her of love. Now he felt that it was inevitable,
 12189	but he could not make up his mind to take the final step. He felt
 12190	ashamed; he felt that he was occupying someone elseâs place here
 12191	beside HÃ©lÃ¨ne. âThis happiness is not for you,â some inner voice
 12192	whispered to him. âThis happiness is for those who have not in them
 12193	what there is in you.â
 12194	
 12195	But, as he had to say something, he began by asking her whether she was
 12196	satisfied with the party. She replied in her usual simple manner that
 12197	this name day of hers had been one of the pleasantest she had ever had.
 12198	
 12199	Some of the nearest relatives had not yet left. They were sitting in
 12200	the large drawing room. Prince VasÃ­li came up to Pierre with languid
 12201	footsteps. Pierre rose and said it was getting late. Prince VasÃ­li gave
 12202	him a look of stern inquiry, as though what Pierre had just said was
 12203	so strange that one could not take it in. But then the expression of
 12204	severity changed, and he drew Pierreâs hand downwards, made him sit
 12205	down, and smiled affectionately.
 12206	
 12207	âWell, LÃ«lya?â he asked, turning instantly to his daughter and
 12208	addressing her with the careless tone of habitual tenderness natural to
 12209	parents who have petted their children from babyhood, but which Prince
 12210	VasÃ­li had only acquired by imitating other parents.
 12211	
 12212	And he again turned to Pierre.
 12213	
 12214	âSergÃ©y KuzmÃ­châFrom all sidesââ he said, unbuttoning the top
 12215	button of his waistcoat.
 12216	
 12217	Pierre smiled, but his smile showed that he knew it was not the story
 12218	about SergÃ©y KuzmÃ­ch that interested Prince VasÃ­li just then, and
 12219	Prince VasÃ­li saw that Pierre knew this. He suddenly muttered
 12220	something and went away. It seemed to Pierre that even the prince was
 12221	disconcerted. The sight of the discomposure of that old man of the world
 12222	touched Pierre: he looked at HÃ©lÃ¨ne and she too seemed disconcerted,
 12223	and her look seemed to say: âWell, it is your own fault.â
 12224	
 12225	âThe step must be taken but I cannot, I cannot!â thought Pierre,
 12226	and he again began speaking about indifferent matters, about SergÃ©y
 12227	KuzmÃ­ch, asking what the point of the story was as he had not heard it
 12228	properly. HÃ©lÃ¨ne answered with a smile that she too had missed it.
 12229	
 12230	When Prince VasÃ­li returned to the drawing room, the princess, his
 12231	wife, was talking in low tones to the elderly lady about Pierre.
 12232	
 12233	âOf course, it is a very brilliant match, but happiness, my dear...â
 12234	
 12235	âMarriages are made in heaven,â replied the elderly lady.
 12236	
 12237	Prince VasÃ­li passed by, seeming not to hear the ladies, and sat down
 12238	on a sofa in a far corner of the room. He closed his eyes and seemed to
 12239	be dozing. His head sank forward and then he roused himself.
 12240	
 12241	âAline,â he said to his wife, âgo and see what they are about.â
 12242	
 12243	The princess went up to the door, passed by it with a dignified and
 12244	indifferent air, and glanced into the little drawing room. Pierre and
 12245	HÃ©lÃ¨ne still sat talking just as before.
 12246	
 12247	âStill the same,â she said to her husband.
 12248	
 12249	Prince VasÃ­li frowned, twisting his mouth, his cheeks quivered and his
 12250	face assumed the coarse, unpleasant expression peculiar to him. Shaking
 12251	himself, he rose, threw back his head, and with resolute steps went
 12252	past the ladies into the little drawing room. With quick steps he went
 12253	joyfully up to Pierre. His face was so unusually triumphant that Pierre
 12254	rose in alarm on seeing it.
 12255	
 12256	âThank God!â said Prince VasÃ­li. âMy wife has told me
 12257	everything!â (He put one arm around Pierre and the other around his
 12258	daughter.)ââMy dear boy... LÃ«lya... I am very pleased.â (His
 12259	voice trembled.) âI loved your father... and she will make you a good
 12260	wife... God bless you!...â
 12261	
 12262	He embraced his daughter, and then again Pierre, and kissed him with his
 12263	malodorous mouth. Tears actually moistened his cheeks.
 12264	
 12265	âPrincess, come here!â he shouted.
 12266	
 12267	The old princess came in and also wept. The elderly lady was using
 12268	her handkerchief too. Pierre was kissed, and he kissed the beautiful
 12269	HÃ©lÃ¨neâs hand several times. After a while they were left alone
 12270	again.
 12271	
 12272	âAll this had to be and could not be otherwise,â thought Pierre,
 12273	âso it is useless to ask whether it is good or bad. It is good because
 12274	itâs definite and one is rid of the old tormenting doubt.â Pierre
 12275	held the hand of his betrothed in silence, looking at her beautiful
 12276	bosom as it rose and fell.
 12277	
 12278	âHÃ©lÃ¨ne!â he said aloud and paused.
 12279	
 12280	âSomething special is always said in such cases,â he thought, but
 12281	could not remember what it was that people say. He looked at her face.
 12282	She drew nearer to him. Her face flushed.
 12283	
 12284	âOh, take those off... those...â she said, pointing to his
 12285	spectacles.
 12286	
 12287	Pierre took them off, and his eyes, besides the strange look eyes have
 12288	from which spectacles have just been removed, had also a frightened and
 12289	inquiring look. He was about to stoop over her hand and kiss it, but
 12290	with a rapid, almost brutal movement of her head, she intercepted his
 12291	lips and met them with her own. Her face struck Pierre, by its altered,
 12292	unpleasantly excited expression.
 12293	
 12294	âIt is too late now, itâs done; besides I love her,â thought
 12295	Pierre.
 12296	
 12297	âJe vous aime!â * he said, remembering what has to be said at such
 12298	moments: but his words sounded so weak that he felt ashamed of himself.
 12299	
 12300	    * âI love you.â
 12301	
 12302	
 12303	Six weeks later he was married, and settled in Count BezÃºkhovâs
 12304	large, newly furnished Petersburg house, the happy possessor, as people
 12305	said, of a wife who was a celebrated beauty and of millions of money.

 12311	CHAPTER III
 12312	
 12313	Old Prince Nicholas BolkÃ³nski received a letter from Prince VasÃ­li
 12314	in November, 1805, announcing that he and his son would be paying him
 12315	a visit. âI am starting on a journey of inspection, and of course I
 12316	shall think nothing of an extra seventy miles to come and see you at
 12317	the same time, my honored benefactor,â wrote Prince VasÃ­li. âMy son
 12318	Anatole is accompanying me on his way to the army, so I hope you will
 12319	allow him personally to express the deep respect that, emulating his
 12320	father, he feels for you.â
 12321	
 12322	âIt seems that there will be no need to bring Mary out, suitors are
 12323	coming to us of their own accord,â incautiously remarked the little
 12324	princess on hearing the news.
 12325	
 12326	Prince Nicholas frowned, but said nothing.
 12327	
 12328	A fortnight after the letter Prince VasÃ­liâs servants came one
 12329	evening in advance of him, and he and his son arrived next day.
 12330	
 12331	Old BolkÃ³nski had always had a poor opinion of Prince VasÃ­liâs
 12332	character, but more so recently, since in the new reigns of Paul and
 12333	Alexander Prince VasÃ­li had risen to high position and honors. And now,
 12334	from the hints contained in his letter and given by the little princess,
 12335	he saw which way the wind was blowing, and his low opinion changed into
 12336	a feeling of contemptuous ill will. He snorted whenever he mentioned
 12337	him. On the day of Prince VasÃ­liâs arrival, Prince BolkÃ³nski was
 12338	particularly discontented and out of temper. Whether he was in a bad
 12339	temper because Prince VasÃ­li was coming, or whether his being in a bad
 12340	temper made him specially annoyed at Prince VasÃ­liâs visit, he was
 12341	in a bad temper, and in the morning TÃ­khon had already advised the
 12342	architect not to go to the prince with his report.
 12343	
 12344	âDo you hear how heâs walking?â said TÃ­khon, drawing the
 12345	architectâs attention to the sound of the princeâs footsteps.
 12346	âStepping flat on his heelsâwe know what that means....â
 12347	
 12348	However, at nine oâclock the prince, in his velvet coat with a sable
 12349	collar and cap, went out for his usual walk. It had snowed the day
 12350	before and the path to the hothouse, along which the prince was in the
 12351	habit of walking, had been swept: the marks of the broom were still
 12352	visible in the snow and a shovel had been left sticking in one of the
 12353	soft snowbanks that bordered both sides of the path. The prince went
 12354	through the conservatories, the serfsâ quarters, and the outbuildings,
 12355	frowning and silent.
 12356	
 12357	âCan a sleigh pass?â he asked his overseer, a venerable man,
 12358	resembling his master in manners and looks, who was accompanying him
 12359	back to the house.
 12360	
 12361	âThe snow is deep. I am having the avenue swept, your honor.â
 12362	
 12363	The prince bowed his head and went up to the porch. âGod be
 12364	thanked,â thought the overseer, âthe storm has blown over!â
 12365	
 12366	âIt would have been hard to drive up, your honor,â he added. âI
 12367	heard, your honor, that a minister is coming to visit your honor.â
 12368	
 12369	The prince turned round to the overseer and fixed his eyes on him,
 12370	frowning.
 12371	
 12372	âWhat? A minister? What minister? Who gave orders?â he said in
 12373	his shrill, harsh voice. âThe road is not swept for the princess my
 12374	daughter, but for a minister! For me, there are no ministers!â
 12375	
 12376	âYour honor, I thought...â
 12377	
 12378	âYou thought!â shouted the prince, his words coming more and more
 12379	rapidly and indistinctly. âYou thought!... Rascals! Blackguards!...
 12380	Iâll teach you to think!â and lifting his stick he swung it and
 12381	would have hit AlpÃ¡tych, the overseer, had not the latter instinctively
 12382	avoided the blow. âThought... Blackguards...â shouted the prince
 12383	rapidly.
 12384	
 12385	But although AlpÃ¡tych, frightened at his own temerity in avoiding the
 12386	stroke, came up to the prince, bowing his bald head resignedly before
 12387	him, or perhaps for that very reason, the prince, though he continued
 12388	to shout: âBlackguards!... Throw the snow back on the road!â did not
 12389	lift his stick again but hurried into the house.
 12390	
 12391	Before dinner, Princess Mary and Mademoiselle Bourienne, who knew
 12392	that the prince was in a bad humor, stood awaiting him; Mademoiselle
 12393	Bourienne with a radiant face that said: âI know nothing, I am the
 12394	same as usual,â and Princess Mary pale, frightened, and with downcast
 12395	eyes. What she found hardest to bear was to know that on such occasions
 12396	she ought to behave like Mademoiselle Bourienne, but could not.
 12397	She thought: âIf I seem not to notice he will think that I do not
 12398	sympathize with him; if I seem sad and out of spirits myself, he will
 12399	say (as he has done before) that Iâm in the dumps.â
 12400	
 12401	The prince looked at his daughterâs frightened face and snorted.
 12402	
 12403	âFool... or dummy!â he muttered.
 12404	
 12405	âAnd the other one is not here. Theyâve been telling tales,â he
 12406	thoughtâreferring to the little princess who was not in the dining
 12407	room.
 12408	
 12409	âWhere is the princess?â he asked. âHiding?â
 12410	
 12411	âShe is not very well,â answered Mademoiselle Bourienne with
 12412	a bright smile, âso she wonât come down. It is natural in her
 12413	state.â
 12414	
 12415	âHm! Hm!â muttered the prince, sitting down.
 12416	
 12417	His plate seemed to him not quite clean, and pointing to a spot he
 12418	flung it away. TÃ­khon caught it and handed it to a footman. The little
 12419	princess was not unwell, but had such an overpowering fear of the prince
 12420	that, hearing he was in a bad humor, she had decided not to appear.
 12421	
 12422	âI am afraid for the baby,â she said to Mademoiselle Bourienne:
 12423	âHeaven knows what a fright might do.â
 12424	
 12425	In general at Bald Hills the little princess lived in constant fear, and
 12426	with a sense of antipathy to the old prince which she did not
 12427	realize because the fear was so much the stronger feeling. The prince
 12428	reciprocated this antipathy, but it was overpowered by his contempt
 12429	for her. When the little princess had grown accustomed to life at Bald
 12430	Hills, she took a special fancy to Mademoiselle Bourienne, spent whole
 12431	days with her, asked her to sleep in her room, and often talked with her
 12432	about the old prince and criticized him.
 12433	
 12434	âSo we are to have visitors, mon prince?â remarked Mademoiselle
 12435	Bourienne, unfolding her white napkin with her rosy fingers. âHis
 12436	Excellency Prince VasÃ­li KurÃ¡gin and his son, I understand?â she
 12437	said inquiringly.
 12438	
 12439	âHm!âhis excellency is a puppy.... I got him his appointment in the
 12440	service,â said the prince disdainfully. âWhy his son is coming I
 12441	donât understand. Perhaps Princess Elizabeth and Princess Mary know.
 12442	I donât want him.â (He looked at his blushing daughter.) âAre you
 12443	unwell today? Eh? Afraid of the âministerâ as that idiot AlpÃ¡tych
 12444	called him this morning?â
 12445	
 12446	âNo, mon pÃ¨re.â
 12447	
 12448	Though Mademoiselle Bourienne had been so unsuccessful in her choice
 12449	of a subject, she did not stop talking, but chattered about the
 12450	conservatories and the beauty of a flower that had just opened, and
 12451	after the soup the prince became more genial.
 12452	
 12453	After dinner, he went to see his daughter-in-law. The little princess
 12454	was sitting at a small table, chattering with MÃ¡sha, her maid. She grew
 12455	pale on seeing her father-in-law.
 12456	
 12457	She was much altered. She was now plain rather than pretty. Her cheeks
 12458	had sunk, her lip was drawn up, and her eyes drawn down.
 12459	
 12460	âYes, I feel a kind of oppression,â she said in reply to the
 12461	princeâs question as to how she felt.
 12462	
 12463	âDo you want anything?â
 12464	
 12465	âNo, merci, mon pÃ¨re.â
 12466	
 12467	âWell, all right, all right.â
 12468	
 12469	He left the room and went to the waiting room where AlpÃ¡tych stood with
 12470	bowed head.
 12471	
 12472	âHas the snow been shoveled back?â
 12473	
 12474	âYes, your excellency. Forgive me for heavenâs sake... It was only
 12475	my stupidity.â
 12476	
 12477	âAll right, all right,â interrupted the prince, and laughing his
 12478	unnatural way, he stretched out his hand for AlpÃ¡tych to kiss, and then
 12479	proceeded to his study.
 12480	
 12481	Prince VasÃ­li arrived that evening. He was met in the avenue by
 12482	coachmen and footmen, who, with loud shouts, dragged his sleighs up to
 12483	one of the lodges over the road purposely laden with snow.
 12484	
 12485	Prince VasÃ­li and Anatole had separate rooms assigned to them.
 12486	
 12487	Anatole, having taken off his overcoat, sat with arms akimbo before a
 12488	table on a corner of which he smilingly and absent-mindedly fixed his
 12489	large and handsome eyes. He regarded his whole life as a continual round
 12490	of amusement which someone for some reason had to provide for him.
 12491	And he looked on this visit to a churlish old man and a rich and ugly
 12492	heiress in the same way. All this might, he thought, turn out very well
 12493	and amusingly. âAnd why not marry her if she really has so much money?
 12494	That never does any harm,â thought Anatole.
 12495	
 12496	He shaved and scented himself with the care and elegance which had
 12497	become habitual to him and, his handsome head held high, entered his
 12498	fatherâs room with the good-humored and victorious air natural to
 12499	him. Prince VasÃ­liâs two valets were busy dressing him, and he looked
 12500	round with much animation and cheerfully nodded to his son as the latter
 12501	entered, as if to say: âYes, thatâs how I want you to look.â
 12502	
 12503	âI say, Father, joking apart, is she very hideous?â Anatole asked,
 12504	as if continuing a conversation the subject of which had often been
 12505	mentioned during the journey.
 12506	
 12507	âEnough! What nonsense! Above all, try to be respectful and cautious
 12508	with the old prince.â
 12509	
 12510	âIf he starts a row Iâll go away,â said Prince Anatole. âI
 12511	canât bear those old men! Eh?â
 12512	
 12513	âRemember, for you everything depends on this.â
 12514	
 12515	In the meantime, not only was it known in the maidservantsâ rooms that
 12516	the minister and his son had arrived, but the appearance of both had
 12517	been minutely described. Princess Mary was sitting alone in her room,
 12518	vainly trying to master her agitation.
 12519	
 12520	âWhy did they write, why did Lise tell me about it? It can never
 12521	happen!â she said, looking at herself in the glass. âHow shall I
 12522	enter the drawing room? Even if I like him I canât now be myself with
 12523	him.â The mere thought of her fatherâs look filled her with terror.
 12524	The little princess and Mademoiselle Bourienne had already received
 12525	from MÃ¡sha, the ladyâs maid, the necessary report of how handsome the
 12526	ministerâs son was, with his rosy cheeks and dark eyebrows, and with
 12527	what difficulty the father had dragged his legs upstairs while the son
 12528	had followed him like an eagle, three steps at a time. Having received
 12529	this information, the little princess and Mademoiselle Bourienne, whose
 12530	chattering voices had reached her from the corridor, went into Princess
 12531	Maryâs room.
 12532	
 12533	âYou know theyâve come, Marie?â said the little princess, waddling
 12534	in, and sinking heavily into an armchair.
 12535	
 12536	She was no longer in the loose gown she generally wore in the morning,
 12537	but had on one of her best dresses. Her hair was carefully done and her
 12538	face was animated, which, however, did not conceal its sunken and faded
 12539	outlines. Dressed as she used to be in Petersburg society, it was still
 12540	more noticeable how much plainer she had become. Some unobtrusive touch
 12541	had been added to Mademoiselle Bourienneâs toilet which rendered her
 12542	fresh and pretty face yet more attractive.
 12543	
 12544	âWhat! Are you going to remain as you are, dear princess?â she
 12545	began. âTheyâll be announcing that the gentlemen are in the drawing
 12546	room and we shall have to go down, and you have not smartened yourself
 12547	up at all!â
 12548	
 12549	The little princess got up, rang for the maid, and hurriedly and merrily
 12550	began to devise and carry out a plan of how Princess Mary should be
 12551	dressed. Princess Maryâs self-esteem was wounded by the fact that
 12552	the arrival of a suitor agitated her, and still more so by both
 12553	her companionsâ not having the least conception that it could be
 12554	otherwise. To tell them that she felt ashamed for herself and for them
 12555	would be to betray her agitation, while to decline their offers to
 12556	dress her would prolong their banter and insistence. She flushed, her
 12557	beautiful eyes grew dim, red blotches came on her face, and it took
 12558	on the unattractive martyrlike expression it so often wore, as she
 12559	submitted herself to Mademoiselle Bourienne and Lise. Both these women
 12560	quite sincerely tried to make her look pretty. She was so plain that
 12561	neither of them could think of her as a rival, so they began dressing
 12562	her with perfect sincerity, and with the naÃ¯ve and firm conviction
 12563	women have that dress can make a face pretty.
 12564	
 12565	âNo really, my dear, this dress is not pretty,â said Lise, looking
 12566	sideways at Princess Mary from a little distance. âYou have a maroon
 12567	dress, have it fetched. Really! You know the fate of your whole life may
 12568	be at stake. But this one is too light, itâs not becoming!â
 12569	
 12570	It was not the dress, but the face and whole figure of Princess Mary
 12571	that was not pretty, but neither Mademoiselle Bourienne nor the little
 12572	princess felt this; they still thought that if a blue ribbon were placed
 12573	in the hair, the hair combed up, and the blue scarf arranged lower on
 12574	the best maroon dress, and so on, all would be well. They forgot that
 12575	the frightened face and the figure could not be altered, and that
 12576	however they might change the setting and adornment of that face, it
 12577	would still remain piteous and plain. After two or three changes to
 12578	which Princess Mary meekly submitted, just as her hair had been arranged
 12579	on the top of her head (a style that quite altered and spoiled her
 12580	looks) and she had put on a maroon dress with a pale-blue scarf, the
 12581	little princess walked twice round her, now adjusting a fold of the
 12582	dress with her little hand, now arranging the scarf and looking at her
 12583	with her head bent first on one side and then on the other.
 12584	
 12585	âNo, it will not do,â she said decidedly, clasping her hands. âNo,
 12586	Mary, really this dress does not suit you. I prefer you in your little
 12587	gray everyday dress. Now please, do it for my sake. Katie,â she said
 12588	to the maid, âbring the princess her gray dress, and youâll see,
 12589	Mademoiselle Bourienne, how I shall arrange it,â she added, smiling
 12590	with a foretaste of artistic pleasure.
 12591	
 12592	But when Katie brought the required dress, Princess Mary remained
 12593	sitting motionless before the glass, looking at her face, and saw in the
 12594	mirror her eyes full of tears and her mouth quivering, ready to burst
 12595	into sobs.
 12596	
 12597	âCome, dear princess,â said Mademoiselle Bourienne, âjust one more
 12598	little effort.â
 12599	
 12600	The little princess, taking the dress from the maid, came up to Princess
 12601	Mary.
 12602	
 12603	âWell, now weâll arrange something quite simple and becoming,â she
 12604	said.
 12605	
 12606	The three voices, hers, Mademoiselle Bourienneâs, and Katieâs, who
 12607	was laughing at something, mingled in a merry sound, like the chirping
 12608	of birds.
 12609	
 12610	âNo, leave me alone,â said Princess Mary.
 12611	
 12612	Her voice sounded so serious and so sad that the chirping of the birds
 12613	was silenced at once. They looked at the beautiful, large, thoughtful
 12614	eyes full of tears and of thoughts, gazing shiningly and imploringly at
 12615	them, and understood that it was useless and even cruel to insist.
 12616	
 12617	âAt least, change your coiffure,â said the little princess.
 12618	âDidnât I tell you,â she went on, turning reproachfully to
 12619	Mademoiselle Bourienne, âMaryâs is a face which such a coiffure does
 12620	not suit in the least. Not in the least! Please change it.â
 12621	
 12622	âLeave me alone, please leave me alone! It is all quite the same to
 12623	me,â answered a voice struggling with tears.
 12624	
 12625	Mademoiselle Bourienne and the little princess had to own to themselves
 12626	that Princess Mary in this guise looked very plain, worse than usual,
 12627	but it was too late. She was looking at them with an expression they
 12628	both knew, an expression thoughtful and sad. This expression in Princess
 12629	Mary did not frighten them (she never inspired fear in anyone), but they
 12630	knew that when it appeared on her face, she became mute and was not to
 12631	be shaken in her determination.
 12632	
 12633	âYou will change it, wonât you?â said Lise. And as Princess Mary
 12634	gave no answer, she left the room.
 12635	
 12636	Princess Mary was left alone. She did not comply with Liseâs request,
 12637	she not only left her hair as it was, but did not even look in her
 12638	glass. Letting her arms fall helplessly, she sat with downcast eyes and
 12639	pondered. A husband, a man, a strong dominant and strangely attractive
 12640	being rose in her imagination, and carried her into a totally different
 12641	happy world of his own. She fancied a child, her ownâsuch as she had
 12642	seen the day before in the arms of her nurseâs daughterâat her
 12643	own breast, the husband standing by and gazing tenderly at her and the
 12644	child. âBut no, it is impossible, I am too ugly,â she thought.
 12645	
 12646	âPlease come to tea. The prince will be out in a moment,â came the
 12647	maidâs voice at the door.
 12648	
 12649	She roused herself, and felt appalled at what she had been thinking, and
 12650	before going down she went into the room where the icons hung and, her
 12651	eyes fixed on the dark face of a large icon of the Saviour lit by a
 12652	lamp, she stood before it with folded hands for a few moments. A painful
 12653	doubt filled her soul. Could the joy of love, of earthly love for a
 12654	man, be for her? In her thoughts of marriage Princess Mary dreamed of
 12655	happiness and of children, but her strongest, most deeply hidden longing
 12656	was for earthly love. The more she tried to hide this feeling from
 12657	others and even from herself, the stronger it grew. âO God,â she
 12658	said, âhow am I to stifle in my heart these temptations of the devil?
 12659	How am I to renounce forever these vile fancies, so as peacefully to
 12660	fulfill Thy will?â And scarcely had she put that question than God
 12661	gave her the answer in her own heart. âDesire nothing for thyself,
 12662	seek nothing, be not anxious or envious. Manâs future and thy own fate
 12663	must remain hidden from thee, but live so that thou mayest be ready for
 12664	anything. If it be Godâs will to prove thee in the duties of marriage,
 12665	be ready to fulfill His will.â With this consoling thought (but
 12666	yet with a hope for the fulfillment of her forbidden earthly longing)
 12667	Princess Mary sighed, and having crossed herself went down, thinking
 12668	neither of her gown and coiffure nor of how she would go in nor of what
 12669	she would say. What could all that matter in comparison with the will of
 12670	God, without Whose care not a hair of manâs head can fall?

 12676	CHAPTER IV
 12677	
 12678	When Princess Mary came down, Prince VasÃ­li and his son were already
 12679	in the drawing room, talking to the little princess and Mademoiselle
 12680	Bourienne. When she entered with her heavy step, treading on her heels,
 12681	the gentlemen and Mademoiselle Bourienne rose and the little princess,
 12682	indicating her to the gentlemen, said: âVoilÃ  Marie!â Princess Mary
 12683	saw them all and saw them in detail. She saw Prince VasÃ­liâs face,
 12684	serious for an instant at the sight of her, but immediately smiling
 12685	again, and the little princess curiously noting the impression
 12686	âMarieâ produced on the visitors. And she saw Mademoiselle
 12687	Bourienne, with her ribbon and pretty face, and her unusually animated
 12688	look which was fixed on him, but him she could not see, she only saw
 12689	something large, brilliant, and handsome moving toward her as she
 12690	entered the room. Prince VasÃ­li approached first, and she kissed the
 12691	bold forehead that bent over her hand and answered his question by
 12692	saying that, on the contrary, she remembered him quite well. Then
 12693	Anatole came up to her. She still could not see him. She only felt a
 12694	soft hand taking hers firmly, and she touched with her lips a white
 12695	forehead, over which was beautiful light-brown hair smelling of pomade.
 12696	When she looked up at him she was struck by his beauty. Anatole stood
 12697	with his right thumb under a button of his uniform, his chest expanded
 12698	and his back drawn in, slightly swinging one foot, and, with his head a
 12699	little bent, looked with beaming face at the princess without
 12700	speaking and evidently not thinking about her at all. Anatole was not
 12701	quick-witted, nor ready or eloquent in conversation, but he had the
 12702	faculty, so invaluable in society, of composure and imperturbable
 12703	self-possession. If a man lacking in self-confidence remains dumb on
 12704	a first introduction and betrays a consciousness of the impropriety of
 12705	such silence and an anxiety to find something to say, the effect is
 12706	bad. But Anatole was dumb, swung his foot, and smilingly examined the
 12707	princessâ hair. It was evident that he could be silent in this way for
 12708	a very long time. âIf anyone finds this silence inconvenient, let him
 12709	talk, but I donât want to,â he seemed to say. Besides this, in his
 12710	behavior to women Anatole had a manner which particularly inspires in
 12711	them curiosity, awe, and even loveâa supercilious consciousness of
 12712	his own superiority. It was as if he said to them: âI know you, I know
 12713	you, but why should I bother about you? Youâd be only too glad, of
 12714	course.â Perhaps he did not really think this when he met womenâeven
 12715	probably he did not, for in general he thought very littleâbut his
 12716	looks and manner gave that impression. The princess felt this, and as if
 12717	wishing to show him that she did not even dare expect to interest him,
 12718	she turned to his father. The conversation was general and animated,
 12719	thanks to Princess Liseâs voice and little downy lip that lifted over
 12720	her white teeth. She met Prince VasÃ­li with that playful manner often
 12721	employed by lively chatty people, and consisting in the assumption
 12722	that between the person they so address and themselves there are some
 12723	semi-private, long-established jokes and amusing reminiscences, though
 12724	no such reminiscences really existâjust as none existed in this case.
 12725	Prince VasÃ­li readily adopted her tone and the little princess also
 12726	drew Anatole, whom she hardly knew, into these amusing recollections of
 12727	things that had never occurred. Mademoiselle Bourienne also shared them
 12728	and even Princess Mary felt herself pleasantly made to share in these
 12729	merry reminiscences.
 12730	
 12731	âHere at least we shall have the benefit of your company all to
 12732	ourselves, dear prince,â said the little princess (of course, in
 12733	French) to Prince VasÃ­li. âItâs not as at Annetteâs * receptions
 12734	where you always ran away; you remember cette chÃ¨re Annette!â
 12735	
 12736	    * Anna PÃ¡vlovna.
 12737	
 12738	âAh, but you wonât talk politics to me like Annette!â
 12739	
 12740	âAnd our little tea table?â
 12741	
 12742	âOh, yes!â
 12743	
 12744	âWhy is it you were never at Annetteâs?â the little princess asked
 12745	Anatole. âAh, I know, I know,â she said with a sly glance, âyour
 12746	brother Hippolyte told me about your goings on. Oh!â and she shook her
 12747	finger at him, âI have even heard of your doings in Paris!â
 12748	
 12749	âAnd didnât Hippolyte tell you?â asked Prince VasÃ­li, turning to
 12750	his son and seizing the little princessâ arm as if she would have run
 12751	away and he had just managed to catch her, âdidnât he tell you how
 12752	he himself was pining for the dear princess, and how she showed him the
 12753	door? Oh, she is a pearl among women, Princess,â he added, turning to
 12754	Princess Mary.
 12755	
 12756	When Paris was mentioned, Mademoiselle Bourienne for her part seized the
 12757	opportunity of joining in the general current of recollections.
 12758	
 12759	She took the liberty of inquiring whether it was long since Anatole
 12760	had left Paris and how he had liked that city. Anatole answered the
 12761	Frenchwoman very readily and, looking at her with a smile, talked to her
 12762	about her native land. When he saw the pretty little Bourienne, Anatole
 12763	came to the conclusion that he would not find Bald Hills dull either.
 12764	âNot at all bad!â he thought, examining her, ânot at all bad, that
 12765	little companion! I hope she will bring her along with her when weâre
 12766	married, la petite est gentille.â *
 12767	
 12768	    * The little one is charming.
 12769	
 12770	The old prince dressed leisurely in his study, frowning and considering
 12771	what he was to do. The coming of these visitors annoyed him. âWhat are
 12772	Prince VasÃ­li and that son of his to me? Prince VasÃ­li is a shallow
 12773	braggart and his son, no doubt, is a fine specimen,â he grumbled to
 12774	himself. What angered him was that the coming of these visitors revived
 12775	in his mind an unsettled question he always tried to stifle, one about
 12776	which he always deceived himself. The question was whether he could ever
 12777	bring himself to part from his daughter and give her to a husband. The
 12778	prince never directly asked himself that question, knowing beforehand
 12779	that he would have to answer it justly, and justice clashed not only
 12780	with his feelings but with the very possibility of life. Life without
 12781	Princess Mary, little as he seemed to value her, was unthinkable to
 12782	him. âAnd why should she marry?â he thought. âTo be unhappy for
 12783	certain. Thereâs Lise, married to Andrewâa better husband one would
 12784	think could hardly be found nowadaysâbut is she contented with her
 12785	lot? And who would marry Marie for love? Plain and awkward! Theyâll
 12786	take her for her connections and wealth. Are there no women living
 12787	unmarried, and even the happier for it?â So thought Prince BolkÃ³nski
 12788	while dressing, and yet the question he was always putting off demanded
 12789	an immediate answer. Prince VasÃ­li had brought his son with the evident
 12790	intention of proposing, and today or tomorrow he would probably ask
 12791	for an answer. His birth and position in society were not bad. âWell,
 12792	Iâve nothing against it,â the prince said to himself, âbut he must
 12793	be worthy of her. And that is what we shall see.â
 12794	
 12795	âThat is what we shall see! That is what we shall see!â he added
 12796	aloud.
 12797	
 12798	He entered the drawing room with his usual alert step, glancing rapidly
 12799	round the company. He noticed the change in the little princessâ
 12800	dress, Mademoiselle Bourienneâs ribbon, Princess Maryâs unbecoming
 12801	coiffure, Mademoiselle Bourienneâs and Anatoleâs smiles, and the
 12802	loneliness of his daughter amid the general conversation. âGot herself
 12803	up like a fool!â he thought, looking irritably at her. âShe is
 12804	shameless, and he ignores her!â
 12805	
 12806	He went straight up to Prince VasÃ­li.
 12807	
 12808	âWell! How dâye do? How dâye do? Glad to see you!â
 12809	
 12810	âFriendship laughs at distance,â began Prince VasÃ­li in his usual
 12811	rapid, self-confident, familiar tone. âHere is my second son; please
 12812	love and befriend him.â
 12813	
 12814	Prince BolkÃ³nski surveyed Anatole.
 12815	
 12816	âFine young fellow! Fine young fellow!â he said. âWell, come and
 12817	kiss me,â and he offered his cheek.
 12818	
 12819	Anatole kissed the old man, and looked at him with curiosity and perfect
 12820	composure, waiting for a display of the eccentricities his father had
 12821	told him to expect.
 12822	
 12823	Prince BolkÃ³nski sat down in his usual place in the corner of the sofa
 12824	and, drawing up an armchair for Prince VasÃ­li, pointed to it and began
 12825	questioning him about political affairs and news. He seemed to listen
 12826	attentively to what Prince VasÃ­li said, but kept glancing at Princess
 12827	Mary.
 12828	
 12829	âAnd so they are writing from Potsdam already?â he said, repeating
 12830	Prince VasÃ­liâs last words. Then rising, he suddenly went up to his
 12831	daughter.
 12832	
 12833	âIs it for visitors youâve got yourself up like that, eh?â said
 12834	he. âFine, very fine! You have done up your hair in this new way for
 12835	the visitors, and before the visitors I tell you that in future you are
 12836	never to dare to change your way of dress without my consent.â
 12837	
 12838	âIt was my fault, mon pÃ¨re,â interceded the little princess, with a
 12839	blush.
 12840	
 12841	âYou must do as you please,â said Prince BolkÃ³nski, bowing to his
 12842	daughter-in-law, âbut she need not make a fool of herself, sheâs
 12843	plain enough as it is.â
 12844	
 12845	And he sat down again, paying no more attention to his daughter, who was
 12846	reduced to tears.
 12847	
 12848	âOn the contrary, that coiffure suits the princess very well,â said
 12849	Prince VasÃ­li.
 12850	
 12851	âNow you, young prince, whatâs your name?â said Prince BolkÃ³nski,
 12852	turning to Anatole, âcome here, let us talk and get acquainted.â
 12853	
 12854	âNow the fun begins,â thought Anatole, sitting down with a smile
 12855	beside the old prince.
 12856	
 12857	âWell, my dear boy, I hear youâve been educated abroad, not taught
 12858	to read and write by the deacon, like your father and me. Now tell me,
 12859	my dear boy, are you serving in the Horse Guards?â asked the old man,
 12860	scrutinizing Anatole closely and intently.
 12861	
 12862	âNo, I have been transferred to the line,â said Anatole, hardly able
 12863	to restrain his laughter.
 12864	
 12865	âAh! Thatâs a good thing. So, my dear boy, you wish to serve the
 12866	Tsar and the country? It is wartime. Such a fine fellow must serve.
 12867	Well, are you off to the front?â
 12868	
 12869	âNo, Prince, our regiment has gone to the front, but I am attached...
 12870	what is it I am attached to, Papa?â said Anatole, turning to his
 12871	father with a laugh.
 12872	
 12873	âA splendid soldier, splendid! âWhat am I attached to!â Ha, ha,
 12874	ha!â laughed Prince BolkÃ³nski, and Anatole laughed still louder.
 12875	Suddenly Prince BolkÃ³nski frowned.
 12876	
 12877	âYou may go,â he said to Anatole.
 12878	
 12879	Anatole returned smiling to the ladies.
 12880	
 12881	âAnd so youâve had him educated abroad, Prince VasÃ­li, havenât
 12882	you?â said the old prince to Prince VasÃ­li.
 12883	
 12884	âI have done my best for him, and I can assure you the education there
 12885	is much better than ours.â
 12886	
 12887	âYes, everything is different nowadays, everything is changed. The
 12888	ladâs a fine fellow, a fine fellow! Well, come with me now.â He took
 12889	Prince VasÃ­liâs arm and led him to his study. As soon as they were
 12890	alone together, Prince VasÃ­li announced his hopes and wishes to the old
 12891	prince.
 12892	
 12893	âWell, do you think I shall prevent her, that I canât part from
 12894	her?â said the old prince angrily. âWhat an idea! Iâm ready for it
 12895	tomorrow! Only let me tell you, I want to know my son-in-law better. You
 12896	know my principlesâeverything aboveboard! I will ask her tomorrow in
 12897	your presence; if she is willing, then he can stay on. He can stay and
 12898	Iâll see.â The old prince snorted. âLet her marry, itâs all the
 12899	same to me!â he screamed in the same piercing tone as when parting
 12900	from his son.
 12901	
 12902	âI will tell you frankly,â said Prince VasÃ­li in the tone of
 12903	a crafty man convinced of the futility of being cunning with so
 12904	keen-sighted a companion. âYou know, you see right through people.
 12905	Anatole is no genius, but he is an honest, goodhearted lad; an excellent
 12906	son or kinsman.â
 12907	
 12908	âAll right, all right, weâll see!â
 12909	
 12910	As always happens when women lead lonely lives for any length of time
 12911	without male society, on Anatoleâs appearance all the three women of
 12912	Prince BolkÃ³nskiâs household felt that their life had not been real
 12913	till then. Their powers of reasoning, feeling, and observing immediately
 12914	increased tenfold, and their life, which seemed to have been passed in
 12915	darkness, was suddenly lit up by a new brightness, full of significance.
 12916	
 12917	Princess Mary grew quite unconscious of her face and coiffure. The
 12918	handsome open face of the man who might perhaps be her husband absorbed
 12919	all her attention. He seemed to her kind, brave, determined, manly, and
 12920	magnanimous. She felt convinced of that. Thousands of dreams of a future
 12921	family life continually rose in her imagination. She drove them away and
 12922	tried to conceal them.
 12923	
 12924	âBut am I not too cold with him?â thought the princess. âI try
 12925	to be reserved because in the depth of my soul I feel too near to him
 12926	already, but then he cannot know what I think of him and may imagine
 12927	that I do not like him.â
 12928	
 12929	And Princess Mary tried, but could not manage, to be cordial to her new
 12930	guest. âPoor girl, sheâs devilish ugly!â thought Anatole.
 12931	
 12932	Mademoiselle Bourienne, also roused to great excitement by Anatoleâs
 12933	arrival, thought in another way. Of course, she, a handsome young woman
 12934	without any definite position, without relations or even a country, did
 12935	not intend to devote her life to serving Prince BolkÃ³nski, to reading
 12936	aloud to him and being friends with Princess Mary. Mademoiselle
 12937	Bourienne had long been waiting for a Russian prince who, able to
 12938	appreciate at a glance her superiority to the plain, badly dressed,
 12939	ungainly Russian princesses, would fall in love with her and carry her
 12940	off; and here at last was a Russian prince. Mademoiselle Bourienne knew
 12941	a story, heard from her aunt but finished in her own way, which she
 12942	liked to repeat to herself. It was the story of a girl who had been
 12943	seduced, and to whom her poor mother (sa pauvre mÃ¨re) appeared, and
 12944	reproached her for yielding to a man without being married. Mademoiselle
 12945	Bourienne was often touched to tears as in imagination she told this
 12946	story to him, her seducer. And now he, a real Russian prince, had
 12947	appeared. He would carry her away and then sa pauvre mÃ¨re would appear
 12948	and he would marry her. So her future shaped itself in Mademoiselle
 12949	Bourienneâs head at the very time she was talking to Anatole about
 12950	Paris. It was not calculation that guided her (she did not even for a
 12951	moment consider what she should do), but all this had long been familiar
 12952	to her, and now that Anatole had appeared it just grouped itself around
 12953	him and she wished and tried to please him as much as possible.
 12954	
 12955	The little princess, like an old war horse that hears the trumpet,
 12956	unconsciously and quite forgetting her condition, prepared for the
 12957	familiar gallop of coquetry, without any ulterior motive or any
 12958	struggle, but with naÃ¯ve and lighthearted gaiety.
 12959	
 12960	Although in female society Anatole usually assumed the role of a man
 12961	tired of being run after by women, his vanity was flattered by the
 12962	spectacle of his power over these three women. Besides that, he was
 12963	beginning to feel for the pretty and provocative Mademoiselle Bourienne
 12964	that passionate animal feeling which was apt to master him with great
 12965	suddenness and prompt him to the coarsest and most reckless actions.
 12966	
 12967	After tea, the company went into the sitting room and Princess Mary was
 12968	asked to play on the clavichord. Anatole, laughing and in high spirits,
 12969	came and leaned on his elbows, facing her and beside Mademoiselle
 12970	Bourienne. Princess Mary felt his look with a painfully joyous emotion.
 12971	Her favorite sonata bore her into a most intimately poetic world and
 12972	the look she felt upon her made that world still more poetic. But
 12973	Anatoleâs expression, though his eyes were fixed on her, referred not
 12974	to her but to the movements of Mademoiselle Bourienneâs little
 12975	foot, which he was then touching with his own under the clavichord.
 12976	Mademoiselle Bourienne was also looking at Princess Mary, and in her
 12977	lovely eyes there was a look of fearful joy and hope that was also new
 12978	to the princess.
 12979	
 12980	âHow she loves me!â thought Princess Mary. âHow happy I am now,
 12981	and how happy I may be with such a friend and such a husband! Husband?
 12982	Can it be possible?â she thought, not daring to look at his face, but
 12983	still feeling his eyes gazing at her.
 12984	
 12985	In the evening, after supper, when all were about to retire, Anatole
 12986	kissed Princess Maryâs hand. She did not know how she found the
 12987	courage, but she looked straight into his handsome face as it came near
 12988	to her shortsighted eyes. Turning from Princess Mary he went up and
 12989	kissed Mademoiselle Bourienneâs hand. (This was not etiquette, but
 12990	then he did everything so simply and with such assurance!) Mademoiselle
 12991	Bourienne flushed, and gave the princess a frightened look.
 12992	
 12993	âWhat delicacy!â thought the princess. âIs it possible that
 12994	AmÃ©lieâ (Mademoiselle Bourienne) âthinks I could be jealous of her,
 12995	and not value her pure affection and devotion to me?â She went up
 12996	to her and kissed her warmly. Anatole went up to kiss the little
 12997	princessâ hand.
 12998	
 12999	âNo! No! No! When your father writes to tell me that you are behaving
 13000	well I will give you my hand to kiss. Not till then!â she said. And
 13001	smilingly raising a finger at him, she left the room.
 13002	
 13003	
 13004	
 13005	
 13006	
 13007	CHAPTER V
 13008	
 13009	They all separated, but, except Anatole who fell asleep as soon as he
 13010	got into bed, all kept awake a long time that night.
 13011	
 13012	âIs he really to be my husband, this stranger who is so kindâyes,
 13013	kind, that is the chief thing,â thought Princess Mary; and fear, which
 13014	she had seldom experienced, came upon her. She feared to look round, it
 13015	seemed to her that someone was there standing behind the screen in the
 13016	dark corner. And this someone was heâthe devilâand he was also this
 13017	man with the white forehead, black eyebrows, and red lips.
 13018	
 13019	She rang for her maid and asked her to sleep in her room.
 13020	
 13021	Mademoiselle Bourienne walked up and down the conservatory for a long
 13022	time that evening, vainly expecting someone, now smiling at someone, now
 13023	working herself up to tears with the imaginary words of her pauvre mÃ¨re
 13024	rebuking her for her fall.
 13025	
 13026	The little princess grumbled to her maid that her bed was badly made.
 13027	She could not lie either on her face or on her side. Every position was
 13028	awkward and uncomfortable, and her burden oppressed her now more than
 13029	ever because Anatoleâs presence had vividly recalled to her the time
 13030	when she was not like that and when everything was light and gay. She
 13031	sat in an armchair in her dressing jacket and nightcap and Katie, sleepy
 13032	and disheveled, beat and turned the heavy feather bed for the third
 13033	time, muttering to herself.
 13034	
 13035	âI told you it was all lumps and holes!â the little princess
 13036	repeated. âI should be glad enough to fall asleep, so itâs not my
 13037	fault!â and her voice quivered like that of a child about to cry.
 13038	
 13039	The old prince did not sleep either. TÃ­khon, half asleep, heard him
 13040	pacing angrily about and snorting. The old prince felt as though he
 13041	had been insulted through his daughter. The insult was the more pointed
 13042	because it concerned not himself but another, his daughter, whom he
 13043	loved more than himself. He kept telling himself that he would consider
 13044	the whole matter and decide what was right and how he should act, but
 13045	instead of that he only excited himself more and more.
 13046	
 13047	âThe first man that turns upâshe forgets her father and everything
 13048	else, runs upstairs and does up her hair and wags her tail and is unlike
 13049	herself! Glad to throw her father over! And she knew I should notice
 13050	it. Fr... fr... fr! And donât I see that that idiot had eyes only for
 13051	BourienneâI shall have to get rid of her. And how is it she has not
 13052	pride enough to see it? If she has no pride for herself she might at
 13053	least have some for my sake! She must be shown that the blockhead thinks
 13054	nothing of her and looks only at Bourienne. No, she has no pride... but
 13055	Iâll let her see....â
 13056	
 13057	The old prince knew that if he told his daughter she was making a
 13058	mistake and that Anatole meant to flirt with Mademoiselle Bourienne,
 13059	Princess Maryâs self-esteem would be wounded and his point (not to
 13060	be parted from her) would be gained, so pacifying himself with this
 13061	thought, he called TÃ­khon and began to undress.
 13062	
 13063	âWhat devil brought them here?â thought he, while TÃ­khon was
 13064	putting the nightshirt over his dried-up old body and gray-haired chest.
 13065	âI never invited them. They came to disturb my lifeâand there is not
 13066	much of it left.â
 13067	
 13068	âDevil take âem!â he muttered, while his head was still covered by
 13069	the shirt.
 13070	
 13071	TÃ­khon knew his masterâs habit of sometimes thinking aloud, and
 13072	therefore met with unaltered looks the angrily inquisitive expression of
 13073	the face that emerged from the shirt.
 13074	
 13075	âGone to bed?â asked the prince.
 13076	
 13077	TÃ­khon, like all good valets, instinctively knew the direction of his
 13078	masterâs thoughts. He guessed that the question referred to Prince
 13079	VasÃ­li and his son.
 13080	
 13081	âThey have gone to bed and put out their lights, your excellency.â
 13082	
 13083	âNo good... no good...â said the prince rapidly, and thrusting his
 13084	feet into his slippers and his arms into the sleeves of his dressing
 13085	gown, he went to the couch on which he slept.
 13086	
 13087	Though no words had passed between Anatole and Mademoiselle Bourienne,
 13088	they quite understood one another as to the first part of their romance,
 13089	up to the appearance of the pauvre mÃ¨re; they understood that they had
 13090	much to say to one another in private and so they had been seeking an
 13091	opportunity since morning to meet one another alone. When Princess Mary
 13092	went to her fatherâs room at the usual hour, Mademoiselle Bourienne
 13093	and Anatole met in the conservatory.
 13094	
 13095	Princess Mary went to the door of the study with special trepidation.
 13096	It seemed to her that not only did everybody know that her fate would be
 13097	decided that day, but that they also knew what she thought about it. She
 13098	read this in TÃ­khonâs face and in that of Prince VasÃ­liâs valet,
 13099	who made her a low bow when she met him in the corridor carrying hot
 13100	water.
 13101	
 13102	The old prince was very affectionate and careful in his treatment of
 13103	his daughter that morning. Princess Mary well knew this painstaking
 13104	expression of her fatherâs. His face wore that expression when his
 13105	dry hands clenched with vexation at her not understanding a sum in
 13106	arithmetic, when rising from his chair he would walk away from her,
 13107	repeating in a low voice the same words several times over.
 13108	
 13109	He came to the point at once, treating her ceremoniously.
 13110	
 13111	âI have had a proposition made me concerning you,â he said with an
 13112	unnatural smile. âI expect you have guessed that Prince VasÃ­li has
 13113	not come and brought his pupil with himâ (for some reason Prince
 13114	BolkÃ³nski referred to Anatole as a âpupilâ) âfor the sake of my
 13115	beautiful eyes. Last night a proposition was made me on your account
 13116	and, as you know my principles, I refer it to you.â
 13117	
 13118	âHow am I to understand you, mon pÃ¨re?â said the princess, growing
 13119	pale and then blushing.
 13120	
 13121	âHow understand me!â cried her father angrily. âPrince VasÃ­li
 13122	finds you to his taste as a daughter-in-law and makes a proposal to you
 13123	on his pupilâs behalf. Thatâs how itâs to be understood! âHow
 13124	understand itâ!... And I ask you!â
 13125	
 13126	âI do not know what you think, Father,â whispered the princess.
 13127	
 13128	âI? I? What of me? Leave me out of the question. Iâm not going to
 13129	get married. What about you? Thatâs what I want to know.â
 13130	
 13131	The princess saw that her father regarded the matter with disapproval,
 13132	but at that moment the thought occurred to her that her fate would be
 13133	decided now or never. She lowered her eyes so as not to see the gaze
 13134	under which she felt that she could not think, but would only be able to
 13135	submit from habit, and she said: âI wish only to do your will, but if
 13136	I had to express my own desire...â She had no time to finish. The old
 13137	prince interrupted her.
 13138	
 13139	âThatâs admirable!â he shouted. âHe will take you with your
 13140	dowry and take Mademoiselle Bourienne into the bargain. Sheâll be the
 13141	wife, while you...â
 13142	
 13143	The prince stopped. He saw the effect these words had produced on his
 13144	daughter. She lowered her head and was ready to burst into tears.
 13145	
 13146	âNow then, now then, Iâm only joking!â he said. âRemember this,
 13147	Princess, I hold to the principle that a maiden has a full right to
 13148	choose. I give you freedom. Only remember that your lifeâs happiness
 13149	depends on your decision. Never mind me!â
 13150	
 13151	âBut I do not know, Father!â
 13152	
 13153	âThereâs no need to talk! He receives his orders and will marry you
 13154	or anybody; but you are free to choose.... Go to your room, think it
 13155	over, and come back in an hour and tell me in his presence: yes or no.
 13156	I know you will pray over it. Well, pray if you like, but you had better
 13157	think it over. Go! Yes or no, yes or no, yes or no!â he still shouted
 13158	when the princess, as if lost in a fog, had already staggered out of the
 13159	study.
 13160	
 13161	Her fate was decided and happily decided. But what her father had said
 13162	about Mademoiselle Bourienne was dreadful. It was untrue to be sure, but
 13163	still it was terrible, and she could not help thinking of it. She was
 13164	going straight on through the conservatory, neither seeing nor hearing
 13165	anything, when suddenly the well-known whispering of Mademoiselle
 13166	Bourienne aroused her. She raised her eyes, and two steps away saw
 13167	Anatole embracing the Frenchwoman and whispering something to her. With
 13168	a horrified expression on his handsome face, Anatole looked at Princess
 13169	Mary, but did not at once take his arm from the waist of Mademoiselle
 13170	Bourienne who had not yet seen her.
 13171	
 13172	âWhoâs that? Why? Wait a moment!â Anatoleâs face seemed to say.
 13173	Princess Mary looked at them in silence. She could not understand it. At
 13174	last Mademoiselle Bourienne gave a scream and ran away. Anatole bowed to
 13175	Princess Mary with a gay smile, as if inviting her to join in a laugh at
 13176	this strange incident, and then shrugging his shoulders went to the door
 13177	that led to his own apartments.
 13178	
 13179	An hour later, TÃ­khon came to call Princess Mary to the old prince;
 13180	he added that Prince VasÃ­li was also there. When TÃ­khon came to her
 13181	Princess Mary was sitting on the sofa in her room, holding the weeping
 13182	Mademoiselle Bourienne in her arms and gently stroking her hair. The
 13183	princessâ beautiful eyes with all their former calm radiance were
 13184	looking with tender affection and pity at Mademoiselle Bourienneâs
 13185	pretty face.
 13186	
 13187	âNo, Princess, I have lost your affection forever!â said
 13188	Mademoiselle Bourienne.
 13189	
 13190	âWhy? I love you more than ever,â said Princess Mary, âand I will
 13191	try to do all I can for your happiness.â
 13192	
 13193	âBut you despise me. You who are so pure can never understand being so
 13194	carried away by passion. Oh, only my poor mother...â
 13195	
 13196	âI quite understand,â answered Princess Mary, with a sad smile.
 13197	âCalm yourself, my dear. I will go to my father,â she said, and went
 13198	out.
 13199	
 13200	Prince VasÃ­li, with one leg thrown high over the other and a snuffbox
 13201	in his hand, was sitting there with a smile of deep emotion on his face,
 13202	as if stirred to his heartâs core and himself regretting and laughing
 13203	at his own sensibility, when Princess Mary entered. He hurriedly took a
 13204	pinch of snuff.
 13205	
 13206	âAh, my dear, my dear!â he began, rising and taking her by both
 13207	hands. Then, sighing, he added: âMy sonâs fate is in your hands.
 13208	Decide, my dear, good, gentle Marie, whom I have always loved as a
 13209	daughter!â
 13210	
 13211	He drew back and a real tear appeared in his eye.
 13212	
 13213	âFr... fr...â snorted Prince BolkÃ³nski. âThe prince is making a
 13214	proposition to you in his pupilâsâI mean, his sonâsâname. Do you
 13215	wish or not to be Prince Anatole KurÃ¡ginâs wife? Reply: yes or no,â
 13216	he shouted, âand then I shall reserve the right to state my opinion
 13217	also. Yes, my opinion, and only my opinion,â added Prince BolkÃ³nski,
 13218	turning to Prince VasÃ­li and answering his imploring look. âYes, or
 13219	no?â
 13220	
 13221	âMy desire is never to leave you, Father, never to separate my
 13222	life from yours. I donât wish to marry,â she answered positively,
 13223	glancing at Prince VasÃ­li and at her father with her beautiful eyes.
 13224	
 13225	âHumbug! Nonsense! Humbug, humbug, humbug!â cried Prince BolkÃ³nski,
 13226	frowning and taking his daughterâs hand; he did not kiss her, but only
 13227	bending his forehead to hers just touched it, and pressed her hand so
 13228	that she winced and uttered a cry.
 13229	
 13230	Prince VasÃ­li rose.
 13231	
 13232	âMy dear, I must tell you that this is a moment I shall never, never
 13233	forget. But, my dear, will you not give us a little hope of touching
 13234	this heart, so kind and generous? Say âperhapsâ... The future is so
 13235	long. Say âperhaps.ââ
 13236	
 13237	âPrince, what I have said is all there is in my heart. I thank you for
 13238	the honor, but I shall never be your sonâs wife.â
 13239	
 13240	âWell, so thatâs finished, my dear fellow! I am very glad to have
 13241	seen you. Very glad! Go back to your rooms, Princess. Go!â said
 13242	the old prince. âVery, very glad to have seen you,â repeated he,
 13243	embracing Prince VasÃ­li.
 13244	
 13245	âMy vocation is a different one,â thought Princess Mary. âMy
 13246	vocation is to be happy with another kind of happiness, the happiness
 13247	of love and self-sacrifice. And cost what it may, I will arrange
 13248	poor AmÃ©lieâs happiness, she loves him so passionately, and so
 13249	passionately repents. I will do all I can to arrange the match between
 13250	them. If he is not rich I will give her the means; I will ask my
 13251	father and Andrew. I shall be so happy when she is his wife. She is so
 13252	unfortunate, a stranger, alone, helpless! And, oh God, how passionately
 13253	she must love him if she could so far forget herself! Perhaps I might
 13254	have done the same!...â thought Princess Mary.
 13255	
 13256	
 13257	
 13258	
 13259	
 13260	CHAPTER VI
 13261	
 13262	It was long since the RostÃ³vs had news of Nicholas. Not till midwinter
 13263	was the count at last handed a letter addressed in his sonâs
 13264	handwriting. On receiving it, he ran on tiptoe to his study in alarm and
 13265	haste, trying to escape notice, closed the door, and began to read the
 13266	letter.
 13267	
 13268	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, who always knew everything that passed in the house,
 13269	on hearing of the arrival of the letter went softly into the room and
 13270	found the count with it in his hand, sobbing and laughing at the same
 13271	time.
 13272	
 13273	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, though her circumstances had improved, was still
 13274	living with the RostÃ³vs.
 13275	
 13276	âMy dear friend?â said she, in a tone of pathetic inquiry, prepared
 13277	to sympathize in any way.
 13278	
 13279	The count sobbed yet more.
 13280	
 13281	âNikÃ³lenka... a letter... wa... a... s... wounded... my darling
 13282	boy... the countess... promoted to be an officer... thank God... How
 13283	tell the little countess!â
 13284	
 13285	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna sat down beside him, with her own handkerchief wiped
 13286	the tears from his eyes and from the letter, then having dried her
 13287	own eyes she comforted the count, and decided that at dinner and till
 13288	teatime she would prepare the countess, and after tea, with Godâs
 13289	help, would inform her.
 13290	
 13291	At dinner Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna talked the whole time about the war news
 13292	and about NikÃ³lenka, twice asked when the last letter had been received
 13293	from him, though she knew that already, and remarked that they might
 13294	very likely be getting a letter from him that day. Each time that these
 13295	hints began to make the countess anxious and she glanced uneasily at
 13296	the count and at Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, the latter very adroitly turned
 13297	the conversation to insignificant matters. NatÃ¡sha, who, of the whole
 13298	family, was the most gifted with a capacity to feel any shades of
 13299	intonation, look, and expression, pricked up her ears from the beginning
 13300	of the meal and was certain that there was some secret between her
 13301	father and Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, that it had something to do with her
 13302	brother, and that Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna was preparing them for it. Bold as
 13303	she was, NatÃ¡sha, who knew how sensitive her mother was to anything
 13304	relating to NikÃ³lenka, did not venture to ask any questions at dinner,
 13305	but she was too excited to eat anything and kept wriggling about on her
 13306	chair regardless of her governessâ remarks. After dinner, she rushed
 13307	headlong after Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna and, dashing at her, flung herself on
 13308	her neck as soon as she overtook her in the sitting room.
 13309	
 13310	âAuntie, darling, do tell me what it is!â
 13311	
 13312	âNothing, my dear.â
 13313	
 13314	âNo, dearest, sweet one, honey, I wonât give upâI know you know
 13315	something.â
 13316	
 13317	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna shook her head.
 13318	
 13319	âYou are a little slyboots,â she said.
 13320	
 13321	âA letter from NikÃ³lenka! Iâm sure of it!â exclaimed NatÃ¡sha,
 13322	reading confirmation in Anna MikhÃ¡ylovnaâs face.
 13323	
 13324	âBut for Godâs sake, be careful, you know how it may affect your
 13325	mamma.â
 13326	
 13327	âI will, I will, only tell me! You wonât? Then I will go and tell at
 13328	once.â
 13329	
 13330	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, in a few words, told her the contents of the letter,
 13331	on condition that she should tell no one.
 13332	
 13333	âNo, on my true word of honor,â said NatÃ¡sha, crossing herself,
 13334	âI wonât tell anyone!â and she ran off at once to SÃ³nya.
 13335	
 13336	âNikÃ³lenka... wounded... a letter,â she announced in gleeful
 13337	triumph.
 13338	
 13339	âNicholas!â was all SÃ³nya said, instantly turning white.
 13340	
 13341	NatÃ¡sha, seeing the impression the news of her brotherâs wound
 13342	produced on SÃ³nya, felt for the first time the sorrowful side of the
 13343	news.
 13344	
 13345	She rushed to SÃ³nya, hugged her, and began to cry.
 13346	
 13347	âA little wound, but he has been made an officer; he is well now, he
 13348	wrote himself,â said she through her tears.
 13349	
 13350	âThere now! Itâs true that all you women are crybabies,â remarked
 13351	PÃ©tya, pacing the room with large, resolute strides. âNow Iâm very
 13352	glad, very glad indeed, that my brother has distinguished himself so.
 13353	You are all blubberers and understand nothing.â
 13354	
 13355	NatÃ¡sha smiled through her tears.
 13356	
 13357	âYou havenât read the letter?â asked SÃ³nya.
 13358	
 13359	âNo, but she said that it was all over and that heâs now an
 13360	officer.â
 13361	
 13362	âThank God!â said SÃ³nya, crossing herself. âBut perhaps she
 13363	deceived you. Let us go to Mamma.â
 13364	
 13365	PÃ©tya paced the room in silence for a time.
 13366	
 13367	âIf Iâd been in NikÃ³lenkaâs place I would have killed even more
 13368	of those Frenchmen,â he said. âWhat nasty brutes they are! Iâd
 13369	have killed so many that thereâd have been a heap of them.â
 13370	
 13371	âHold your tongue, PÃ©tya, what a goose you are!â
 13372	
 13373	âIâm not a goose, but they are who cry about trifles,â said
 13374	PÃ©tya.
 13375	
 13376	âDo you remember him?â NatÃ¡sha suddenly asked, after a momentâs
 13377	silence.
 13378	
 13379	SÃ³nya smiled.
 13380	
 13381	âDo I remember Nicholas?â
 13382	
 13383	âNo, SÃ³nya, but do you remember so that you remember him perfectly,
 13384	remember everything?â said NatÃ¡sha, with an expressive gesture,
 13385	evidently wishing to give her words a very definite meaning. âI
 13386	remember NikÃ³lenka too, I remember him well,â she said. âBut I
 13387	donât remember BorÃ­s. I donât remember him a bit.â
 13388	
 13389	âWhat! You donât remember BorÃ­s?â asked SÃ³nya in surprise.
 13390	
 13391	âItâs not that I donât rememberâI know what he is like, but not
 13392	as I remember NikÃ³lenka. HimâI just shut my eyes and remember,
 13393	but BorÃ­s... No!â (She shut her eyes.) âNo! thereâs nothing at
 13394	all.â
 13395	
 13396	âOh, NatÃ¡sha!â said SÃ³nya, looking ecstatically and earnestly at
 13397	her friend as if she did not consider her worthy to hear what she meant
 13398	to say and as if she were saying it to someone else, with whom joking
 13399	was out of the question, âI am in love with your brother once for all
 13400	and, whatever may happen to him or to me, shall never cease to love him
 13401	as long as I live.â
 13402	
 13403	NatÃ¡sha looked at SÃ³nya with wondering and inquisitive eyes, and said
 13404	nothing. She felt that SÃ³nya was speaking the truth, that there was
 13405	such love as SÃ³nya was speaking of. But NatÃ¡sha had not yet felt
 13406	anything like it. She believed it could be, but did not understand it.
 13407	
 13408	âShall you write to him?â she asked.
 13409	
 13410	SÃ³nya became thoughtful. The question of how to write to Nicholas, and
 13411	whether she ought to write, tormented her. Now that he was already an
 13412	officer and a wounded hero, would it be right to remind him of herself
 13413	and, as it might seem, of the obligations to her he had taken on
 13414	himself?
 13415	
 13416	âI donât know. I think if he writes, I will write too,â she said,
 13417	blushing.
 13418	
 13419	âAnd you wonât feel ashamed to write to him?â
 13420	
 13421	SÃ³nya smiled.
 13422	
 13423	âNo.â
 13424	
 13425	âAnd I should be ashamed to write to BorÃ­s. Iâm not going to.â
 13426	
 13427	âWhy should you be ashamed?â
 13428	
 13429	âWell, I donât know. Itâs awkward and would make me ashamed.â
 13430	
 13431	âAnd I know why sheâd be ashamed,â said PÃ©tya, offended by
 13432	NatÃ¡shaâs previous remark. âItâs because she was in love with
 13433	that fat one in spectaclesâ (that was how PÃ©tya described his
 13434	namesake, the new Count BezÃºkhov) âand now sheâs in love with that
 13435	singerâ (he meant NatÃ¡shaâs Italian singing master), âthatâs
 13436	why sheâs ashamed!â
 13437	
 13438	âPÃ©tya, youâre a stupid!â said NatÃ¡sha.
 13439	
 13440	âNot more stupid than you, madam,â said the nine-year-old PÃ©tya,
 13441	with the air of an old brigadier.
 13442	
 13443	The countess had been prepared by Anna MikhÃ¡ylovnaâs hints at dinner.
 13444	On retiring to her own room, she sat in an armchair, her eyes fixed on a
 13445	miniature portrait of her son on the lid of a snuffbox, while the tears
 13446	kept coming into her eyes. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, with the letter, came on
 13447	tiptoe to the countessâ door and paused.
 13448	
 13449	âDonât come in,â she said to the old count who was following her.
 13450	âCome later.â And she went in, closing the door behind her.
 13451	
 13452	The count put his ear to the keyhole and listened.
 13453	
 13454	At first he heard the sound of indifferent voices, then Anna
 13455	MikhÃ¡ylovnaâs voice alone in a long speech, then a cry, then silence,
 13456	then both voices together with glad intonations, and then footsteps.
 13457	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna opened the door. Her face wore the proud expression
 13458	of a surgeon who has just performed a difficult operation and admits the
 13459	public to appreciate his skill.
 13460	
 13461	âIt is done!â she said to the count, pointing triumphantly to the
 13462	countess, who sat holding in one hand the snuffbox with its portrait and
 13463	in the other the letter, and pressing them alternately to her lips.
 13464	
 13465	When she saw the count, she stretched out her arms to him, embraced his
 13466	bald head, over which she again looked at the letter and the portrait,
 13467	and in order to press them again to her lips, she slightly pushed away
 13468	the bald head. VÃ©ra, NatÃ¡sha, SÃ³nya, and PÃ©tya now entered the room,
 13469	and the reading of the letter began. After a brief description of
 13470	the campaign and the two battles in which he had taken part, and his
 13471	promotion, Nicholas said that he kissed his fatherâs and motherâs
 13472	hands asking for their blessing, and that he kissed VÃ©ra, NatÃ¡sha, and
 13473	PÃ©tya. Besides that, he sent greetings to Monsieur Schelling, Madame
 13474	Schoss, and his old nurse, and asked them to kiss for him âdear
 13475	SÃ³nya, whom he loved and thought of just the same as ever.â When she
 13476	heard this SÃ³nya blushed so that tears came into her eyes and, unable
 13477	to bear the looks turned upon her, ran away into the dancing hall,
 13478	whirled round it at full speed with her dress puffed out like a balloon,
 13479	and, flushed and smiling, plumped down on the floor. The countess was
 13480	crying.
 13481	
 13482	âWhy are you crying, Mamma?â asked VÃ©ra. âFrom all he says one
 13483	should be glad and not cry.â
 13484	
 13485	This was quite true, but the count, the countess, and NatÃ¡sha looked
 13486	at her reproachfully. âAnd who is it she takes after?â thought the
 13487	countess.
 13488	
 13489	Nicholasâ letter was read over hundreds of times, and those who were
 13490	considered worthy to hear it had to come to the countess, for she
 13491	did not let it out of her hands. The tutors came, and the nurses, and
 13492	DmÃ­tri, and several acquaintances, and the countess reread the letter
 13493	each time with fresh pleasure and each time discovered in it fresh
 13494	proofs of NikÃ³lenkaâs virtues. How strange, how extraordinary, how
 13495	joyful it seemed, that her son, the scarcely perceptible motion of whose
 13496	tiny limbs she had felt twenty years ago within her, that son about whom
 13497	she used to have quarrels with the too indulgent count, that son who
 13498	had first learned to say âpearâ and then âgranny,â that this son
 13499	should now be away in a foreign land amid strange surroundings, a manly
 13500	warrior doing some kind of manâs work of his own, without help or
 13501	guidance. The universal experience of ages, showing that children do
 13502	grow imperceptibly from the cradle to manhood, did not exist for the
 13503	countess. Her sonâs growth toward manhood, at each of its stages,
 13504	had seemed as extraordinary to her as if there had never existed the
 13505	millions of human beings who grew up in the same way. As twenty
 13506	years before, it seemed impossible that the little creature who lived
 13507	somewhere under her heart would ever cry, suck her breast, and begin to
 13508	speak, so now she could not believe that that little creature could be
 13509	this strong, brave man, this model son and officer that, judging by this
 13510	letter, he now was.
 13511	
 13512	âWhat a style! How charmingly he describes!â said she, reading the
 13513	descriptive part of the letter. âAnd what a soul! Not a word about
 13514	himself.... Not a word! About some DenÃ­sov or other, though he himself,
 13515	I dare say, is braver than any of them. He says nothing about his
 13516	sufferings. What a heart! How like him it is! And how he has remembered
 13517	everybody! Not forgetting anyone. I always said when he was only so
 13518	highâI always said....â
 13519	
 13520	For more than a week preparations were being made, rough drafts of
 13521	letters to Nicholas from all the household were written and copied out,
 13522	while under the supervision of the countess and the solicitude of the
 13523	count, money and all things necessary for the uniform and equipment
 13524	of the newly commissioned officer were collected. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna,
 13525	practical woman that she was, had even managed by favor with army
 13526	authorities to secure advantageous means of communication for herself
 13527	and her son. She had opportunities of sending her letters to the Grand
 13528	Duke Constantine PÃ¡vlovich, who commanded the Guards. The RostÃ³vs
 13529	supposed that The Russian Guards, Abroad, was quite a definite address,
 13530	and that if a letter reached the Grand Duke in command of the Guards
 13531	there was no reason why it should not reach the PÃ¡vlograd regiment,
 13532	which was presumably somewhere in the same neighborhood. And so it was
 13533	decided to send the letters and money by the Grand Dukeâs courier to
 13534	BorÃ­s and BorÃ­s was to forward them to Nicholas. The letters were from
 13535	the old count, the countess, PÃ©tya, VÃ©ra, NatÃ¡sha, and SÃ³nya, and
 13536	finally there were six thousand rubles for his outfit and various other
 13537	things the old count sent to his son.

 13543	CHAPTER VII
 13544	
 13545	On the twelfth of November, KutÃºzovâs active army, in camp before
 13546	OlmÃ¼tz, was preparing to be reviewed next day by the two Emperorsâthe
 13547	Russian and the Austrian. The Guards, just arrived from Russia, spent
 13548	the night ten miles from OlmÃ¼tz and next morning were to come straight
 13549	to the review, reaching the field at OlmÃ¼tz by ten oâclock.
 13550	
 13551	That day Nicholas RostÃ³v received a letter from BorÃ­s, telling him
 13552	that the IsmÃ¡ylov regiment was quartered for the night ten miles from
 13553	OlmÃ¼tz and that he wanted to see him as he had a letter and money for
 13554	him. RostÃ³v was particularly in need of money now that the troops,
 13555	after their active service, were stationed near OlmÃ¼tz and the camp
 13556	swarmed with well-provisioned sutlers and Austrian Jews offering
 13557	all sorts of tempting wares. The PÃ¡vlograds held feast after feast,
 13558	celebrating awards they had received for the campaign, and made
 13559	expeditions to OlmÃ¼tz to visit a certain Caroline the Hungarian,
 13560	who had recently opened a restaurant there with girls as waitresses.
 13561	RostÃ³v, who had just celebrated his promotion to a cornetcy and bought
 13562	DenÃ­sovâs horse, Bedouin, was in debt all round, to his comrades and
 13563	the sutlers. On receiving BorÃ­sâ letter he rode with a fellow officer
 13564	to OlmÃ¼tz, dined there, drank a bottle of wine, and then set off alone
 13565	to the Guardsâ camp to find his old playmate. RostÃ³v had not yet had
 13566	time to get his uniform. He had on a shabby cadet jacket, decorated with
 13567	a soldierâs cross, equally shabby cadetâs riding breeches lined with
 13568	worn leather, and an officerâs saber with a sword knot. The Don horse
 13569	he was riding was one he had bought from a Cossack during the campaign,
 13570	and he wore a crumpled hussar cap stuck jauntily back on one side of his
 13571	head. As he rode up to the camp he thought how he would impress BorÃ­s
 13572	and all his comrades of the Guards by his appearanceâthat of a
 13573	fighting hussar who had been under fire.
 13574	
 13575	The Guards had made their whole march as if on a pleasure trip, parading
 13576	their cleanliness and discipline. They had come by easy stages, their
 13577	knapsacks conveyed on carts, and the Austrian authorities had provided
 13578	excellent dinners for the officers at every halting place. The regiments
 13579	had entered and left the town with their bands playing, and by the Grand
 13580	Dukeâs orders the men had marched all the way in step (a practice on
 13581	which the Guards prided themselves), the officers on foot and at their
 13582	proper posts. BorÃ­s had been quartered, and had marched all the
 13583	way, with Berg who was already in command of a company. Berg, who had
 13584	obtained his captaincy during the campaign, had gained the confidence of
 13585	his superiors by his promptitude and accuracy and had arranged his money
 13586	matters very satisfactorily. BorÃ­s, during the campaign, had made the
 13587	acquaintance of many persons who might prove useful to him, and by
 13588	a letter of recommendation he had brought from Pierre had become
 13589	acquainted with Prince Andrew BolkÃ³nski, through whom he hoped to
 13590	obtain a post on the commander in chiefâs staff. Berg and BorÃ­s,
 13591	having rested after yesterdayâs march, were sitting, clean and neatly
 13592	dressed, at a round table in the clean quarters allotted to them,
 13593	playing chess. Berg held a smoking pipe between his knees. BorÃ­s, in
 13594	the accurate way characteristic of him, was building a little pyramid of
 13595	chessmen with his delicate white fingers while awaiting Bergâs move,
 13596	and watched his opponentâs face, evidently thinking about the game as
 13597	he always thought only of whatever he was engaged on.
 13598	
 13599	âWell, how are you going to get out of that?â he remarked.
 13600	
 13601	âWeâll try to,â replied Berg, touching a pawn and then removing
 13602	his hand.
 13603	
 13604	At that moment the door opened.
 13605	
 13606	âHere he is at last!â shouted RostÃ³v. âAnd Berg too! Oh, you
 13607	petisenfans, allay cushay dormir!â he exclaimed, imitating his Russian
 13608	nurseâs French, at which he and BorÃ­s used to laugh long ago.
 13609	
 13610	âDear me, how you have changed!â
 13611	
 13612	BorÃ­s rose to meet RostÃ³v, but in doing so did not omit to steady and
 13613	replace some chessmen that were falling. He was about to embrace his
 13614	friend, but Nicholas avoided him. With that peculiar feeling of youth,
 13615	that dread of beaten tracks, and wish to express itself in a manner
 13616	different from that of its elders which is often insincere, Nicholas
 13617	wished to do something special on meeting his friend. He wanted to pinch
 13618	him, push him, do anything but kiss himâa thing everybody did. But
 13619	notwithstanding this, BorÃ­s embraced him in a quiet, friendly way and
 13620	kissed him three times.
 13621	
 13622	They had not met for nearly half a year and, being at the age when young
 13623	men take their first steps on lifeâs road, each saw immense changes in
 13624	the other, quite a new reflection of the society in which they had taken
 13625	those first steps. Both had changed greatly since they last met and both
 13626	were in a hurry to show the changes that had taken place in them.
 13627	
 13628	âOh, you damned dandies! Clean and fresh as if youâd been to a fete,
 13629	not like us sinners of the line,â cried RostÃ³v, with martial swagger
 13630	and with baritone notes in his voice, new to BorÃ­s, pointing to his own
 13631	mud-bespattered breeches. The German landlady, hearing RostÃ³vâs loud
 13632	voice, popped her head in at the door.
 13633	
 13634	âEh, is she pretty?â he asked with a wink.
 13635	
 13636	âWhy do you shout so? Youâll frighten them!â said BorÃ­s. âI did
 13637	not expect you today,â he added. âI only sent you the note yesterday
 13638	by BolkÃ³nskiâan adjutant of KutÃºzovâs, whoâs a friend of mine.
 13639	I did not think he would get it to you so quickly.... Well, how are you?
 13640	Been under fire already?â asked BorÃ­s.
 13641	
 13642	Without answering, RostÃ³v shook the soldierâs Cross of St. George
 13643	fastened to the cording of his uniform and, indicating a bandaged arm,
 13644	glanced at Berg with a smile.
 13645	
 13646	âAs you see,â he said.
 13647	
 13648	âIndeed? Yes, yes!â said BorÃ­s, with a smile. âAnd we too have
 13649	had a splendid march. You know, of course, that His Imperial Highness
 13650	rode with our regiment all the time, so that we had every comfort and
 13651	every advantage. What receptions we had in Poland! What dinners and
 13652	balls! I canât tell you. And the TsarÃ©vich was very gracious to all
 13653	our officers.â
 13654	
 13655	And the two friends told each other of their doings, the one of his
 13656	hussar revels and life in the fighting line, the other of the pleasures
 13657	and advantages of service under members of the Imperial family.
 13658	
 13659	âOh, you Guards!â said RostÃ³v. âI say, send for some wine.â
 13660	
 13661	BorÃ­s made a grimace.
 13662	
 13663	âIf you really want it,â said he.
 13664	
 13665	He went to his bed, drew a purse from under the clean pillow, and sent
 13666	for wine.
 13667	
 13668	âYes, and I have some money and a letter to give you,â he added.
 13669	
 13670	RostÃ³v took the letter and, throwing the money on the sofa, put both
 13671	arms on the table and began to read. After reading a few lines, he
 13672	glanced angrily at Berg, then, meeting his eyes, hid his face behind the
 13673	letter.
 13674	
 13675	âWell, theyâve sent you a tidy sum,â said Berg, eying the heavy
 13676	purse that sank into the sofa. âAs for us, Count, we get along on our
 13677	pay. I can tell you for myself...â
 13678	
 13679	âI say, Berg, my dear fellow,â said RostÃ³v, âwhen you get a
 13680	letter from home and meet one of your own people whom you want to talk
 13681	everything over with, and I happen to be there, Iâll go at once, to
 13682	be out of your way! Do go somewhere, anywhere... to the devil!â he
 13683	exclaimed, and immediately seizing him by the shoulder and looking
 13684	amiably into his face, evidently wishing to soften the rudeness of his
 13685	words, he added, âDonât be hurt, my dear fellow; you know I speak
 13686	from my heart as to an old acquaintance.â
 13687	
 13688	âOh, donât mention it, Count! I quite understand,â said Berg,
 13689	getting up and speaking in a muffled and guttural voice.
 13690	
 13691	âGo across to our hosts: they invited you,â added BorÃ­s.
 13692	
 13693	Berg put on the cleanest of coats, without a spot or speck of dust,
 13694	stood before a looking glass and brushed the hair on his temples
 13695	upwards, in the way affected by the Emperor Alexander, and, having
 13696	assured himself from the way RostÃ³v looked at it that his coat had been
 13697	noticed, left the room with a pleasant smile.
 13698	
 13699	âOh dear, what a beast I am!â muttered RostÃ³v, as he read the
 13700	letter.
 13701	
 13702	âWhy?â
 13703	
 13704	âOh, what a pig I am, not to have written and to have given them
 13705	such a fright! Oh, what a pig I am!â he repeated, flushing suddenly.
 13706	âWell, have you sent Gabriel for some wine? All right letâs have
 13707	some!â
 13708	
 13709	In the letter from his parents was enclosed a letter of recommendation
 13710	to BagratiÃ³n which the old countess at Anna MikhÃ¡ylovnaâs advice had
 13711	obtained through an acquaintance and sent to her son, asking him to take
 13712	it to its destination and make use of it.
 13713	
 13714	âWhat nonsense! Much I need it!â said RostÃ³v, throwing the letter
 13715	under the table.
 13716	
 13717	âWhy have you thrown that away?â asked BorÃ­s.
 13718	
 13719	âIt is some letter of recommendation... what the devil do I want it
 13720	for!â
 13721	
 13722	âWhy âWhat the devilâ?â said BorÃ­s, picking it up and reading
 13723	the address. âThis letter would be of great use to you.â
 13724	
 13725	âI want nothing, and I wonât be anyoneâs adjutant.â
 13726	
 13727	âWhy not?â inquired BorÃ­s.
 13728	
 13729	âItâs a lackeyâs job!â
 13730	
 13731	âYou are still the same dreamer, I see,â remarked BorÃ­s, shaking
 13732	his head.
 13733	
 13734	âAnd youâre still the same diplomatist! But thatâs not the
 13735	point... Come, how are you?â asked RostÃ³v.
 13736	
 13737	âWell, as you see. So far everythingâs all right, but I confess I
 13738	should much like to be an adjutant and not remain at the front.â
 13739	
 13740	âWhy?â
 13741	
 13742	âBecause when once a man starts on military service, he should try to
 13743	make as successful a career of it as possible.â
 13744	
 13745	âOh, thatâs it!â said RostÃ³v, evidently thinking of something
 13746	else.
 13747	
 13748	He looked intently and inquiringly into his friendâs eyes, evidently
 13749	trying in vain to find the answer to some question.
 13750	
 13751	Old Gabriel brought in the wine.
 13752	
 13753	âShouldnât we now send for Berg?â asked BorÃ­s. âHe would drink
 13754	with you. I canât.â
 13755	
 13756	âWell, send for him... and how do you get on with that German?â
 13757	asked RostÃ³v, with a contemptuous smile.
 13758	
 13759	âHe is a very, very nice, honest, and pleasant fellow,â answered
 13760	BorÃ­s.
 13761	
 13762	Again RostÃ³v looked intently into BorÃ­sâ eyes and sighed. Berg
 13763	returned, and over the bottle of wine conversation between the three
 13764	officers became animated. The Guardsmen told RostÃ³v of their march and
 13765	how they had been made much of in Russia, Poland, and abroad. They spoke
 13766	of the sayings and doings of their commander, the Grand Duke, and told
 13767	stories of his kindness and irascibility. Berg, as usual, kept silent
 13768	when the subject did not relate to himself, but in connection with the
 13769	stories of the Grand Dukeâs quick temper he related with gusto how in
 13770	Galicia he had managed to deal with the Grand Duke when the latter
 13771	made a tour of the regiments and was annoyed at the irregularity of
 13772	a movement. With a pleasant smile Berg related how the Grand Duke
 13773	had ridden up to him in a violent passion, shouting: âArnauts!â
 13774	(âArnautsâ was the TsarÃ©vichâs favorite expression when he was in
 13775	a rage) and called for the company commander.
 13776	
 13777	âWould you believe it, Count, I was not at all alarmed, because I knew
 13778	I was right. Without boasting, you know, I may say that I know the Army
 13779	Orders by heart and know the Regulations as well as I do the Lordâs
 13780	Prayer. So, Count, there never is any negligence in my company, and
 13781	so my conscience was at ease. I came forward....â (Berg stood up and
 13782	showed how he presented himself, with his hand to his cap, and really
 13783	it would have been difficult for a face to express greater respect and
 13784	self-complacency than his did.) âWell, he stormed at me, as the saying
 13785	is, stormed and stormed and stormed! It was not a matter of life but
 13786	rather of death, as the saying is. âAlbanians!â and âdevils!â
 13787	and âTo Siberia!ââ said Berg with a sagacious smile. âI knew I
 13788	was in the right so I kept silent; was not that best, Count?... âHey,
 13789	are you dumb?â he shouted. Still I remained silent. And what do you
 13790	think, Count? The next day it was not even mentioned in the Orders of
 13791	the Day. Thatâs what keeping oneâs head means. Thatâs the way,
 13792	Count,â said Berg, lighting his pipe and emitting rings of smoke.
 13793	
 13794	âYes, that was fine,â said RostÃ³v, smiling.
 13795	
 13796	But BorÃ­s noticed that he was preparing to make fun of Berg, and
 13797	skillfully changed the subject. He asked him to tell them how and where
 13798	he got his wound. This pleased RostÃ³v and he began talking about it,
 13799	and as he went on became more and more animated. He told them of his
 13800	SchÃ¶n Grabern affair, just as those who have taken part in a battle
 13801	generally do describe it, that is, as they would like it to have been,
 13802	as they have heard it described by others, and as sounds well, but not
 13803	at all as it really was. RostÃ³v was a truthful young man and would on
 13804	no account have told a deliberate lie. He began his story meaning to
 13805	tell everything just as it happened, but imperceptibly, involuntarily,
 13806	and inevitably he lapsed into falsehood. If he had told the truth to his
 13807	hearersâwho like himself had often heard stories of attacks and had
 13808	formed a definite idea of what an attack was and were expecting to hear
 13809	just such a storyâthey would either not have believed him or, still
 13810	worse, would have thought that RostÃ³v was himself to blame since what
 13811	generally happens to the narrators of cavalry attacks had not happened
 13812	to him. He could not tell them simply that everyone went at a trot and
 13813	that he fell off his horse and sprained his arm and then ran as hard as
 13814	he could from a Frenchman into the wood. Besides, to tell everything as
 13815	it really happened, it would have been necessary to make an effort of
 13816	will to tell only what happened. It is very difficult to tell the truth,
 13817	and young people are rarely capable of it. His hearers expected a story
 13818	of how beside himself and all aflame with excitement, he had flown like
 13819	a storm at the square, cut his way in, slashed right and left, how his
 13820	saber had tasted flesh and he had fallen exhausted, and so on. And so he
 13821	told them all that.
 13822	
 13823	In the middle of his story, just as he was saying: âYou cannot imagine
 13824	what a strange frenzy one experiences during an attack,â Prince
 13825	Andrew, whom BorÃ­s was expecting, entered the room. Prince Andrew, who
 13826	liked to help young men, was flattered by being asked for his assistance
 13827	and being well disposed toward BorÃ­s, who had managed to please him the
 13828	day before, he wished to do what the young man wanted. Having been sent
 13829	with papers from KutÃºzov to the TsarÃ©vich, he looked in on BorÃ­s,
 13830	hoping to find him alone. When he came in and saw an hussar of the line
 13831	recounting his military exploits (Prince Andrew could not endure
 13832	that sort of man), he gave BorÃ­s a pleasant smile, frowned as with
 13833	half-closed eyes he looked at RostÃ³v, bowed slightly and wearily, and
 13834	sat down languidly on the sofa: he felt it unpleasant to have dropped
 13835	in on bad company. RostÃ³v flushed up on noticing this, but he did not
 13836	care, this was a mere stranger. Glancing, however, at BorÃ­s, he saw
 13837	that he too seemed ashamed of the hussar of the line.
 13838	
 13839	In spite of Prince Andrewâs disagreeable, ironical tone, in spite of
 13840	the contempt with which RostÃ³v, from his fighting army point of view,
 13841	regarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomer
 13842	was evidently one, RostÃ³v felt confused, blushed, and became silent.
 13843	BorÃ­s inquired what news there might be on the staff, and what, without
 13844	indiscretion, one might ask about our plans.
 13845	
 13846	âWe shall probably advance,â replied BolkÃ³nski, evidently reluctant
 13847	to say more in the presence of a stranger.
 13848	
 13849	Berg took the opportunity to ask, with great politeness, whether, as was
 13850	rumored, the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would be
 13851	doubled. To this Prince Andrew answered with a smile that he could
 13852	give no opinion on such an important government order, and Berg laughed
 13853	gaily.
 13854	
 13855	âAs to your business,â Prince Andrew continued, addressing BorÃ­s,
 13856	âwe will talk of it laterâ (and he looked round at RostÃ³v). âCome
 13857	to me after the review and we will do what is possible.â
 13858	
 13859	And, having glanced round the room, Prince Andrew turned to RostÃ³v,
 13860	whose state of unconquerable childish embarrassment now changing to
 13861	anger he did not condescend to notice, and said: âI think you were
 13862	talking of the SchÃ¶n Grabern affair? Were you there?â
 13863	
 13864	âI was there,â said RostÃ³v angrily, as if intending to insult the
 13865	aide-de-camp.
 13866	
 13867	BolkÃ³nski noticed the hussarâs state of mind, and it amused him. With
 13868	a slightly contemptuous smile, he said: âYes, there are many stories
 13869	now told about that affair!â
 13870	
 13871	âYes, stories!â repeated RostÃ³v loudly, looking with eyes suddenly
 13872	grown furious, now at BorÃ­s, now at BolkÃ³nski. âYes, many stories!
 13873	But our stories are the stories of men who have been under the enemyâs
 13874	fire! Our stories have some weight, not like the stories of those
 13875	fellows on the staff who get rewards without doing anything!â
 13876	
 13877	âOf whom you imagine me to be one?â said Prince Andrew, with a quiet
 13878	and particularly amiable smile.
 13879	
 13880	A strange feeling of exasperation and yet of respect for this manâs
 13881	self-possession mingled at that moment in RostÃ³vâs soul.
 13882	
 13883	âI am not talking about you,â he said, âI donât know you and,
 13884	frankly, I donât want to. I am speaking of the staff in general.â
 13885	
 13886	âAnd I will tell you this,â Prince Andrew interrupted in a tone of
 13887	quiet authority, âyou wish to insult me, and I am ready to agree with
 13888	you that it would be very easy to do so if you havenât sufficient
 13889	self-respect, but admit that the time and place are very badly chosen.
 13890	In a day or two we shall all have to take part in a greater and more
 13891	serious duel, and besides, DrubetskÃ³y, who says he is an old friend
 13892	of yours, is not at all to blame that my face has the misfortune to
 13893	displease you. However,â he added rising, âyou know my name and
 13894	where to find me, but donât forget that I do not regard either myself
 13895	or you as having been at all insulted, and as a man older than you, my
 13896	advice is to let the matter drop. Well then, on Friday after the review
 13897	I shall expect you, DrubetskÃ³y. Au revoir!â exclaimed Prince Andrew,
 13898	and with a bow to them both he went out.
 13899	
 13900	Only when Prince Andrew was gone did RostÃ³v think of what he ought to
 13901	have said. And he was still more angry at having omitted to say it. He
 13902	ordered his horse at once and, coldly taking leave of BorÃ­s, rode
 13903	home. Should he go to headquarters next day and challenge that affected
 13904	adjutant, or really let the matter drop, was the question that worried
 13905	him all the way. He thought angrily of the pleasure he would have at
 13906	seeing the fright of that small and frail but proud man when covered by
 13907	his pistol, and then he felt with surprise that of all the men he knew
 13908	there was none he would so much like to have for a friend as that very
 13909	adjutant whom he so hated.
 13910	
 13911	
 13912	
 13913	
 13914	
 13915	CHAPTER VIII
 13916	
 13917	The day after RostÃ³v had been to see BorÃ­s, a review was held of the
 13918	Austrian and Russian troops, both those freshly arrived from Russia and
 13919	those who had been campaigning under KutÃºzov. The two Emperors,
 13920	the Russian with his heir the TsarÃ©vich, and the Austrian with the
 13921	Archduke, inspected the allied army of eighty thousand men.
 13922	
 13923	From early morning the smart clean troops were on the move, forming up
 13924	on the field before the fortress. Now thousands of feet and bayonets
 13925	moved and halted at the officersâ command, turned with banners flying,
 13926	formed up at intervals, and wheeled round other similar masses of
 13927	infantry in different uniforms; now was heard the rhythmic beat of
 13928	hoofs and the jingling of showy cavalry in blue, red, and green braided
 13929	uniforms, with smartly dressed bandsmen in front mounted on black, roan,
 13930	or gray horses; then again, spreading out with the brazen clatter of the
 13931	polished shining cannon that quivered on the gun carriages and with
 13932	the smell of linstocks, came the artillery which crawled between the
 13933	infantry and cavalry and took up its appointed position. Not only the
 13934	generals in full parade uniforms, with their thin or thick waists drawn
 13935	in to the utmost, their red necks squeezed into their stiff collars, and
 13936	wearing scarves and all their decorations, not only the elegant, pomaded
 13937	officers, but every soldier with his freshly washed and shaven face and
 13938	his weapons clean and polished to the utmost, and every horse groomed
 13939	till its coat shone like satin and every hair of its wetted mane lay
 13940	smoothâfelt that no small matter was happening, but an important and
 13941	solemn affair. Every general and every soldier was conscious of his own
 13942	insignificance, aware of being but a drop in that ocean of men, and
 13943	yet at the same time was conscious of his strength as a part of that
 13944	enormous whole.
 13945	
 13946	From early morning strenuous activities and efforts had begun and by ten
 13947	oâclock all had been brought into due order. The ranks were drawn
 13948	up on the vast field. The whole army was extended in three lines: the
 13949	cavalry in front, behind it the artillery, and behind that again the
 13950	infantry.
 13951	
 13952	A space like a street was left between each two lines of troops. The
 13953	three parts of that army were sharply distinguished: KutÃºzovâs
 13954	fighting army (with the PÃ¡vlograds on the right flank of the front);
 13955	those recently arrived from Russia, both Guards and regiments of the
 13956	line; and the Austrian troops. But they all stood in the same lines,
 13957	under one command, and in a like order.
 13958	
 13959	Like wind over leaves ran an excited whisper: âTheyâre coming!
 13960	Theyâre coming!â Alarmed voices were heard, and a stir of final
 13961	preparation swept over all the troops.
 13962	
 13963	From the direction of OlmÃ¼tz in front of them, a group was seen
 13964	approaching. And at that moment, though the day was still, a light gust
 13965	of wind blowing over the army slightly stirred the streamers on the
 13966	lances and the unfolded standards fluttered against their staffs. It
 13967	looked as if by that slight motion the army itself was expressing its
 13968	joy at the approach of the Emperors. One voice was heard shouting:
 13969	âEyes front!â Then, like the crowing of cocks at sunrise, this was
 13970	repeated by others from various sides and all became silent.
 13971	
 13972	In the deathlike stillness only the tramp of horses was heard. This
 13973	was the Emperorsâ suites. The Emperors rode up to the flank, and the
 13974	trumpets of the first cavalry regiment played the general march. It
 13975	seemed as though not the trumpeters were playing, but as if the army
 13976	itself, rejoicing at the Emperorsâ approach, had naturally burst into
 13977	music. Amid these sounds, only the youthful kindly voice of the Emperor
 13978	Alexander was clearly heard. He gave the words of greeting, and the
 13979	first regiment roared âHurrah!â so deafeningly, continuously, and
 13980	joyfully that the men themselves were awed by their multitude and the
 13981	immensity of the power they constituted.
 13982	
 13983	RostÃ³v, standing in the front lines of KutÃºzovâs army which the Tsar
 13984	approached first, experienced the same feeling as every other man in
 13985	that army: a feeling of self-forgetfulness, a proud consciousness of
 13986	might, and a passionate attraction to him who was the cause of this
 13987	triumph.
 13988	
 13989	He felt that at a single word from that man all this vast mass (and he
 13990	himself an insignificant atom in it) would go through fire and water,
 13991	commit crime, die, or perform deeds of highest heroism, and so he could
 13992	not but tremble and his heart stand still at the imminence of that word.
 13993	
 13994	âHurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!â thundered from all sides, one regiment
 13995	after another greeting the Tsar with the strains of the march, and then
 13996	âHurrah!â... Then the general march, and again âHurrah! Hurrah!â
 13997	growing ever stronger and fuller and merging into a deafening roar.
 13998	
 13999	Till the Tsar reached it, each regiment in its silence and immobility
 14000	seemed like a lifeless body, but as soon as he came up it became alive,
 14001	its thunder joining the roar of the whole line along which he had
 14002	already passed. Through the terrible and deafening roar of those voices,
 14003	amid the square masses of troops standing motionless as if turned to
 14004	stone, hundreds of riders composing the suites moved carelessly but
 14005	symmetrically and above all freely, and in front of them two menâthe
 14006	Emperors. Upon them the undivided, tensely passionate attention of that
 14007	whole mass of men was concentrated.
 14008	
 14009	The handsome young Emperor Alexander, in the uniform of the Horse
 14010	Guards, wearing a cocked hat with its peaks front and back, with his
 14011	pleasant face and resonant though not loud voice, attracted everyoneâs
 14012	attention.
 14013	
 14014	RostÃ³v was not far from the trumpeters, and with his keen sight had
 14015	recognized the Tsar and watched his approach. When he was within twenty
 14016	paces, and Nicholas could clearly distinguish every detail of his
 14017	handsome, happy young face, he experienced a feeling of tenderness
 14018	and ecstasy such as he had never before known. Every trait and every
 14019	movement of the Tsarâs seemed to him enchanting.
 14020	
 14021	Stopping in front of the PÃ¡vlograds, the Tsar said something in French
 14022	to the Austrian Emperor and smiled.
 14023	
 14024	Seeing that smile, RostÃ³v involuntarily smiled himself and felt a still
 14025	stronger flow of love for his sovereign. He longed to show that love in
 14026	some way and knowing that this was impossible was ready to cry. The Tsar
 14027	called the colonel of the regiment and said a few words to him.
 14028	
 14029	âOh God, what would happen to me if the Emperor spoke to me?â
 14030	thought RostÃ³v. âI should die of happiness!â
 14031	
 14032	The Tsar addressed the officers also: âI thank you all, gentlemen, I
 14033	thank you with my whole heart.â To RostÃ³v every word sounded like a
 14034	voice from heaven. How gladly would he have died at once for his Tsar!
 14035	
 14036	âYou have earned the St. Georgeâs standards and will be worthy of
 14037	them.â
 14038	
 14039	âOh, to die, to die for him,â thought RostÃ³v.
 14040	
 14041	The Tsar said something more which RostÃ³v did not hear, and the
 14042	soldiers, straining their lungs, shouted âHurrah!â
 14043	
 14044	RostÃ³v too, bending over his saddle, shouted âHurrah!â with all his
 14045	might, feeling that he would like to injure himself by that shout, if
 14046	only to express his rapture fully.
 14047	
 14048	The Tsar stopped a few minutes in front of the hussars as if undecided.
 14049	
 14050	âHow can the Emperor be undecided?â thought RostÃ³v, but then even
 14051	this indecision appeared to him majestic and enchanting, like everything
 14052	else the Tsar did.
 14053	
 14054	That hesitation lasted only an instant. The Tsarâs foot, in the narrow
 14055	pointed boot then fashionable, touched the groin of the bobtailed bay
 14056	mare he rode, his hand in a white glove gathered up the reins, and he
 14057	moved off accompanied by an irregularly swaying sea of aides-de-camp.
 14058	Farther and farther he rode away, stopping at other regiments, till at
 14059	last only his white plumes were visible to RostÃ³v from amid the suites
 14060	that surrounded the Emperors.
 14061	
 14062	Among the gentlemen of the suite, RostÃ³v noticed BolkÃ³nski, sitting
 14063	his horse indolently and carelessly. RostÃ³v recalled their quarrel of
 14064	yesterday and the question presented itself whether he ought or ought
 14065	not to challenge BolkÃ³nski. âOf course not!â he now thought. âIs
 14066	it worth thinking or speaking of it at such a moment? At a time of such
 14067	love, such rapture, and such self-sacrifice, what do any of our quarrels
 14068	and affronts matter? I love and forgive everybody now.â
 14069	
 14070	When the Emperor had passed nearly all the regiments, the troops began
 14071	a ceremonial march past him, and RostÃ³v on Bedouin, recently purchased
 14072	from DenÃ­sov, rode past too, at the rear of his squadronâthat is,
 14073	alone and in full view of the Emperor.
 14074	
 14075	Before he reached him, RostÃ³v, who was a splendid horseman, spurred
 14076	Bedouin twice and successfully put him to the showy trot in which the
 14077	animal went when excited. Bending his foaming muzzle to his chest, his
 14078	tail extended, Bedouin, as if also conscious of the Emperorâs eye
 14079	upon him, passed splendidly, lifting his feet with a high and graceful
 14080	action, as if flying through the air without touching the ground.
 14081	
 14082	RostÃ³v himself, his legs well back and his stomach drawn in and feeling
 14083	himself one with his horse, rode past the Emperor with a frowning but
 14084	blissful face âlike a vewy devil,â as DenÃ­sov expressed it.
 14085	
 14086	âFine fellows, the PÃ¡vlograds!â remarked the Emperor.
 14087	
 14088	âMy God, how happy I should be if he ordered me to leap into the fire
 14089	this instant!â thought RostÃ³v.
 14090	
 14091	When the review was over, the newly arrived officers, and also
 14092	KutÃºzovâs, collected in groups and began to talk about the awards,
 14093	about the Austrians and their uniforms, about their lines, about
 14094	Bonaparte, and how badly the latter would fare now, especially if the
 14095	Essen corps arrived and Prussia took our side.
 14096	
 14097	But the talk in every group was chiefly about the Emperor Alexander. His
 14098	every word and movement was described with ecstasy.
 14099	
 14100	They all had but one wish: to advance as soon as possible against the
 14101	enemy under the Emperorâs command. Commanded by the Emperor himself
 14102	they could not fail to vanquish anyone, be it whom it might: so thought
 14103	RostÃ³v and most of the officers after the review.
 14104	
 14105	All were then more confident of victory than the winning of two battles
 14106	would have made them.
 14107	
 14108	
 14109	
 14110	
 14111	
 14112	CHAPTER IX
 14113	
 14114	The day after the review, BorÃ­s, in his best uniform and with his
 14115	comrade Bergâs best wishes for success, rode to OlmÃ¼tz to see
 14116	BolkÃ³nski, wishing to profit by his friendliness and obtain for himself
 14117	the best post he couldâpreferably that of adjutant to some important
 14118	personage, a position in the army which seemed to him most attractive.
 14119	âIt is all very well for RostÃ³v, whose father sends him ten thousand
 14120	rubles at a time, to talk about not wishing to cringe to anybody and not
 14121	be anyoneâs lackey, but I who have nothing but my brains have to
 14122	make a career and must not miss opportunities, but must avail myself of
 14123	them!â he reflected.
 14124	
 14125	He did not find Prince Andrew in OlmÃ¼tz that day, but the appearance of
 14126	the town where the headquarters and the diplomatic corps were stationed
 14127	and the two Emperors were living with their suites, households, and
 14128	courts only strengthened his desire to belong to that higher world.
 14129	
 14130	He knew no one, and despite his smart Guardsmanâs uniform, all these
 14131	exalted personages passing in the streets in their elegant carriages
 14132	with their plumes, ribbons, and medals, both courtiers and military
 14133	men, seemed so immeasurably above him, an insignificant officer of the
 14134	Guards, that they not only did not wish to, but simply could not, be
 14135	aware of his existence. At the quarters of the commander in chief,
 14136	KutÃºzov, where he inquired for BolkÃ³nski, all the adjutants and even
 14137	the orderlies looked at him as if they wished to impress on him that a
 14138	great many officers like him were always coming there and that everybody
 14139	was heartily sick of them. In spite of this, or rather because of
 14140	it, next day, November 15, after dinner he again went to OlmÃ¼tz and,
 14141	entering the house occupied by KutÃºzov, asked for BolkÃ³nski. Prince
 14142	Andrew was in and BorÃ­s was shown into a large hall probably formerly
 14143	used for dancing, but in which five beds now stood, and furniture of
 14144	various kinds: a table, chairs, and a clavichord. One adjutant, nearest
 14145	the door, was sitting at the table in a Persian dressing gown, writing.
 14146	Another, the red, stout NesvÃ­tski, lay on a bed with his arms under his
 14147	head, laughing with an officer who had sat down beside him. A third was
 14148	playing a Viennese waltz on the clavichord, while a fourth, lying on
 14149	the clavichord, sang the tune. BolkÃ³nski was not there. None of these
 14150	gentlemen changed his position on seeing BorÃ­s. The one who was writing
 14151	and whom BorÃ­s addressed turned round crossly and told him BolkÃ³nski
 14152	was on duty and that he should go through the door on the left into the
 14153	reception room if he wished to see him. BorÃ­s thanked him and went to
 14154	the reception room, where he found some ten officers and generals.
 14155	
 14156	When he entered, Prince Andrew, his eyes drooping contemptuously (with
 14157	that peculiar expression of polite weariness which plainly says, âIf
 14158	it were not my duty I would not talk to you for a momentâ), was
 14159	listening to an old Russian general with decorations, who stood very
 14160	erect, almost on tiptoe, with a soldierâs obsequious expression on his
 14161	purple face, reporting something.
 14162	
 14163	âVery well, then, be so good as to wait,â said Prince Andrew to the
 14164	general, in Russian, speaking with the French intonation he affected
 14165	when he wished to speak contemptuously, and noticing BorÃ­s, Prince
 14166	Andrew, paying no more heed to the general who ran after him imploring
 14167	him to hear something more, nodded and turned to him with a cheerful
 14168	smile.
 14169	
 14170	At that moment BorÃ­s clearly realized what he had before surmised, that
 14171	in the army, besides the subordination and discipline prescribed in the
 14172	military code, which he and the others knew in the regiment, there was
 14173	another, more important, subordination, which made this tight-laced,
 14174	purple-faced general wait respectfully while Captain Prince Andrew, for
 14175	his own pleasure, chose to chat with Lieutenant DrubetskÃ³y. More than
 14176	ever was BorÃ­s resolved to serve in future not according to the written
 14177	code, but under this unwritten law. He felt now that merely by having
 14178	been recommended to Prince Andrew he had already risen above the general
 14179	who at the front had the power to annihilate him, a lieutenant of the
 14180	Guards. Prince Andrew came up to him and took his hand.
 14181	
 14182	âI am very sorry you did not find me in yesterday. I was fussing about
 14183	with Germans all day. We went with Weyrother to survey the dispositions.
 14184	When Germans start being accurate, thereâs no end to it!â
 14185	
 14186	BorÃ­s smiled, as if he understood what Prince Andrew was alluding to
 14187	as something generally known. But it was the first time he had heard
 14188	Weyrotherâs name, or even the term âdispositions.â
 14189	
 14190	âWell, my dear fellow, so you still want to be an adjutant? I have
 14191	been thinking about you.â
 14192	
 14193	âYes, I was thinkingââfor some reason BorÃ­s could not help
 14194	blushingââof asking the commander in chief. He has had a letter from
 14195	Prince KurÃ¡gin about me. I only wanted to ask because I fear the Guards
 14196	wonât be in action,â he added as if in apology.
 14197	
 14198	âAll right, all right. Weâll talk it over,â replied Prince Andrew.
 14199	âOnly let me report this gentlemanâs business, and I shall be at
 14200	your disposal.â
 14201	
 14202	While Prince Andrew went to report about the purple-faced general, that
 14203	gentlemanâevidently not sharing BorÃ­sâ conception of the advantages
 14204	of the unwritten code of subordinationâlooked so fixedly at the
 14205	presumptuous lieutenant who had prevented his finishing what he had to
 14206	say to the adjutant that BorÃ­s felt uncomfortable. He turned away and
 14207	waited impatiently for Prince Andrewâs return from the commander in
 14208	chiefâs room.
 14209	
 14210	âYou see, my dear fellow, I have been thinking about you,â
 14211	said Prince Andrew when they had gone into the large room where the
 14212	clavichord was. âItâs no use your going to the commander in chief.
 14213	He would say a lot of pleasant things, ask you to dinnerâ (âThat
 14214	would not be bad as regards the unwritten code,â thought BorÃ­s),
 14215	âbut nothing more would come of it. There will soon be a battalion of
 14216	us aides-de-camp and adjutants! But this is what weâll do: I have
 14217	a good friend, an adjutant general and an excellent fellow, Prince
 14218	DolgorÃºkov; and though you may not know it, the fact is that now
 14219	KutÃºzov with his staff and all of us count for nothing. Everything is
 14220	now centered round the Emperor. So we will go to DolgorÃºkov; I have to
 14221	go there anyhow and I have already spoken to him about you. We shall
 14222	see whether he cannot attach you to himself or find a place for you
 14223	somewhere nearer the sun.â
 14224	
 14225	Prince Andrew always became specially keen when he had to guide a young
 14226	man and help him to worldly success. Under cover of obtaining help
 14227	of this kind for another, which from pride he would never accept for
 14228	himself, he kept in touch with the circle which confers success and
 14229	which attracted him. He very readily took up BorÃ­sâ cause and went
 14230	with him to DolgorÃºkov.
 14231	
 14232	It was late in the evening when they entered the palace at OlmÃ¼tz
 14233	occupied by the Emperors and their retinues.
 14234	
 14235	That same day a council of war had been held in which all the members of
 14236	the Hofkriegsrath and both Emperors took part. At that council, contrary
 14237	to the views of the old generals KutÃºzov and Prince Schwartzenberg, it
 14238	had been decided to advance immediately and give battle to Bonaparte.
 14239	The council of war was just over when Prince Andrew accompanied
 14240	by BorÃ­s arrived at the palace to find DolgorÃºkov. Everyone at
 14241	headquarters was still under the spell of the dayâs council, at which
 14242	the party of the young had triumphed. The voices of those who counseled
 14243	delay and advised waiting for something else before advancing had been
 14244	so completely silenced and their arguments confuted by such conclusive
 14245	evidence of the advantages of attacking that what had been discussed
 14246	at the councilâthe coming battle and the victory that would certainly
 14247	result from itâno longer seemed to be in the future but in the past.
 14248	All the advantages were on our side. Our enormous forces, undoubtedly
 14249	superior to Napoleonâs, were concentrated in one place, the troops
 14250	inspired by the Emperorsâ presence were eager for action. The
 14251	strategic position where the operations would take place was familiar in
 14252	all its details to the Austrian General Weyrother: a lucky accident had
 14253	ordained that the Austrian army should maneuver the previous year on the
 14254	very fields where the French had now to be fought; the adjacent
 14255	locality was known and shown in every detail on the maps, and Bonaparte,
 14256	evidently weakened, was undertaking nothing.
 14257	
 14258	DolgorÃºkov, one of the warmest advocates of an attack, had just
 14259	returned from the council, tired and exhausted but eager and proud
 14260	of the victory that had been gained. Prince Andrew introduced his
 14261	protÃ©gÃ©, but Prince DolgorÃºkov politely and firmly pressing his hand
 14262	said nothing to BorÃ­s and, evidently unable to suppress the thoughts
 14263	which were uppermost in his mind at that moment, addressed Prince Andrew
 14264	in French.
 14265	
 14266	âAh, my dear fellow, what a battle we have gained! God grant that
 14267	the one that will result from it will be as victorious! However, dear
 14268	fellow,â he said abruptly and eagerly, âI must confess to having
 14269	been unjust to the Austrians and especially to Weyrother. What
 14270	exactitude, what minuteness, what knowledge of the locality, what
 14271	foresight for every eventuality, every possibility even to the smallest
 14272	detail! No, my dear fellow, no conditions better than our present ones
 14273	could have been devised. This combination of Austrian precision with
 14274	Russian valorâwhat more could be wished for?â
 14275	
 14276	âSo the attack is definitely resolved on?â asked BolkÃ³nski.
 14277	
 14278	âAnd do you know, my dear fellow, it seems to me that Bonaparte has
 14279	decidedly lost bearings, you know that a letter was received from him
 14280	today for the Emperor.â DolgorÃºkov smiled significantly.
 14281	
 14282	âIs that so? And what did he say?â inquired BolkÃ³nski.
 14283	
 14284	âWhat can he say? Tra-di-ri-di-ra and so on... merely to gain time.
 14285	I tell you he is in our hands, thatâs certain! But what was most
 14286	amusing,â he continued, with a sudden, good-natured laugh, âwas that
 14287	we could not think how to address the reply! If not as âConsulâ
 14288	and of course not as âEmperor,â it seemed to me it should be to
 14289	âGeneral Bonaparte.ââ
 14290	
 14291	âBut between not recognizing him as Emperor and calling him General
 14292	Bonaparte, there is a difference,â remarked BolkÃ³nski.
 14293	
 14294	âThatâs just it,â interrupted DolgorÃºkov quickly, laughing.
 14295	âYou know BilÃ­binâheâs a very clever fellow. He suggested
 14296	addressing him as âUsurper and Enemy of Mankind.ââ
 14297	
 14298	DolgorÃºkov laughed merrily.
 14299	
 14300	âOnly that?â said BolkÃ³nski.
 14301	
 14302	âAll the same, it was BilÃ­bin who found a suitable form for the
 14303	address. He is a wise and clever fellow.â
 14304	
 14305	âWhat was it?â
 14306	
 14307	âTo the Head of the French Government... Au chef du gouvernement
 14308	franÃ§ais,â said DolgorÃºkov, with grave satisfaction. âGood,
 14309	wasnât it?â
 14310	
 14311	âYes, but he will dislike it extremely,â said BolkÃ³nski.
 14312	
 14313	âOh yes, very much! My brother knows him, heâs dined with himâthe
 14314	present Emperorâmore than once in Paris, and tells me he never met a
 14315	more cunning or subtle diplomatistâyou know, a combination of French
 14316	adroitness and Italian play-acting! Do you know the tale about him and
 14317	Count MarkÃ³v? Count MarkÃ³v was the only man who knew how to handle
 14318	him. You know the story of the handkerchief? It is delightful!â
 14319	
 14320	And the talkative DolgorÃºkov, turning now to BorÃ­s, now to Prince
 14321	Andrew, told how Bonaparte wishing to test MarkÃ³v, our ambassador,
 14322	purposely dropped a handkerchief in front of him and stood looking
 14323	at MarkÃ³v, probably expecting MarkÃ³v to pick it up for him, and how
 14324	MarkÃ³v immediately dropped his own beside it and picked it up without
 14325	touching Bonaparteâs.
 14326	
 14327	âDelightful!â said BolkÃ³nski. âBut I have come to you, Prince,
 14328	as a petitioner on behalf of this young man. You see...â but
 14329	before Prince Andrew could finish, an aide-de-camp came in to summon
 14330	DolgorÃºkov to the Emperor.
 14331	
 14332	âOh, what a nuisance,â said DolgorÃºkov, getting up hurriedly and
 14333	pressing the hands of Prince Andrew and BorÃ­s. âYou know I should
 14334	be very glad to do all in my power both for you and for this dear young
 14335	man.â Again he pressed the hand of the latter with an expression of
 14336	good-natured, sincere, and animated levity. âBut you see... another
 14337	time!â
 14338	
 14339	BorÃ­s was excited by the thought of being so close to the higher powers
 14340	as he felt himself to be at that moment. He was conscious that here
 14341	he was in contact with the springs that set in motion the enormous
 14342	movements of the mass of which in his regiment he felt himself a tiny,
 14343	obedient, and insignificant atom. They followed Prince DolgorÃºkov out
 14344	into the corridor and metâcoming out of the door of the Emperorâs
 14345	room by which DolgorÃºkov had enteredâa short man in civilian clothes
 14346	with a clever face and sharply projecting jaw which, without spoiling
 14347	his face, gave him a peculiar vivacity and shiftiness of expression.
 14348	This short man nodded to DolgorÃºkov as to an intimate friend and stared
 14349	at Prince Andrew with cool intensity, walking straight toward him and
 14350	evidently expecting him to bow or to step out of his way. Prince Andrew
 14351	did neither: a look of animosity appeared on his face and the other
 14352	turned away and went down the side of the corridor.
 14353	
 14354	âWho was that?â asked BorÃ­s.
 14355	
 14356	âHe is one of the most remarkable, but to me most unpleasant of
 14357	menâthe Minister of Foreign Affairs, Prince Adam CzartorÃ½ski.... It
 14358	is such men as he who decide the fate of nations,â added BolkÃ³nski
 14359	with a sigh he could not suppress, as they passed out of the palace.
 14360	
 14361	Next day, the army began its campaign, and up to the very battle of
 14362	Austerlitz, BorÃ­s was unable to see either Prince Andrew or DolgorÃºkov
 14363	again and remained for a while with the IsmÃ¡ylov regiment.
 14364	
 14365	
 14366	
 14367	
 14368	
 14369	CHAPTER X
 14370	
 14371	At dawn on the sixteenth of November, DenÃ­sovâs squadron, in
 14372	which Nicholas RostÃ³v served and which was in Prince BagratiÃ³nâs
 14373	detachment, moved from the place where it had spent the night, advancing
 14374	into action as arranged, and after going behind other columns for
 14375	about two thirds of a mile was stopped on the highroad. RostÃ³v saw the
 14376	Cossacks and then the first and second squadrons of hussars and infantry
 14377	battalions and artillery pass by and go forward and then Generals
 14378	BagratiÃ³n and DolgorÃºkov ride past with their adjutants. All the fear
 14379	before action which he had experienced as previously, all the inner
 14380	struggle to conquer that fear, all his dreams of distinguishing himself
 14381	as a true hussar in this battle, had been wasted. Their squadron
 14382	remained in reserve and Nicholas RostÃ³v spent that day in a dull and
 14383	wretched mood. At nine in the morning, he heard firing in front and
 14384	shouts of hurrah, and saw wounded being brought back (there were not
 14385	many of them), and at last he saw how a whole detachment of French
 14386	cavalry was brought in, convoyed by a sÃ³tnya of Cossacks. Evidently the
 14387	affair was over and, though not big, had been a successful engagement.
 14388	The men and officers returning spoke of a brilliant victory, of the
 14389	occupation of the town of Wischau and the capture of a whole French
 14390	squadron. The day was bright and sunny after a sharp night frost, and
 14391	the cheerful glitter of that autumn day was in keeping with the news of
 14392	victory which was conveyed, not only by the tales of those who had taken
 14393	part in it, but also by the joyful expression on the faces of soldiers,
 14394	officers, generals, and adjutants, as they passed RostÃ³v going or
 14395	coming. And Nicholas, who had vainly suffered all the dread that
 14396	precedes a battle and had spent that happy day in inactivity, was all
 14397	the more depressed.
 14398	
 14399	âCome here, WostÃ³v. Letâs dwink to dwown our gwief!â shouted
 14400	DenÃ­sov, who had settled down by the roadside with a flask and some
 14401	food.
 14402	
 14403	The officers gathered round DenÃ­sovâs canteen, eating and talking.
 14404	
 14405	âThere! They are bringing another!â cried one of the officers,
 14406	indicating a captive French dragoon who was being brought in on foot by
 14407	two Cossacks.
 14408	
 14409	One of them was leading by the bridle a fine large French horse he had
 14410	taken from the prisoner.
 14411	
 14412	âSell us that horse!â DenÃ­sov called out to the Cossacks.
 14413	
 14414	âIf you like, your honor!â
 14415	
 14416	The officers got up and stood round the Cossacks and their prisoner.
 14417	The French dragoon was a young Alsatian who spoke French with a German
 14418	accent. He was breathless with agitation, his face was red, and when
 14419	he heard some French spoken he at once began speaking to the officers,
 14420	addressing first one, then another. He said he would not have been
 14421	taken, it was not his fault but the corporalâs who had sent him to
 14422	seize some horsecloths, though he had told him the Russians were there.
 14423	And at every word he added: âBut donât hurt my little horse!â and
 14424	stroked the animal. It was plain that he did not quite grasp where he
 14425	was. Now he excused himself for having been taken prisoner and now,
 14426	imagining himself before his own officers, insisted on his soldierly
 14427	discipline and zeal in the service. He brought with him into our
 14428	rearguard all the freshness of atmosphere of the French army, which was
 14429	so alien to us.
 14430	
 14431	The Cossacks sold the horse for two gold pieces, and RostÃ³v, being the
 14432	richest of the officers now that he had received his money, bought it.
 14433	
 14434	âBut donât hurt my little horse!â said the Alsatian good-naturedly
 14435	to RostÃ³v when the animal was handed over to the hussar.
 14436	
 14437	RostÃ³v smilingly reassured the dragoon and gave him money.
 14438	
 14439	âAlley! Alley!â said the Cossack, touching the prisonerâs arm to
 14440	make him go on.
 14441	
 14442	âThe Emperor! The Emperor!â was suddenly heard among the hussars.
 14443	
 14444	All began to run and bustle, and RostÃ³v saw coming up the road behind
 14445	him several riders with white plumes in their hats. In a moment everyone
 14446	was in his place, waiting.
 14447	
 14448	RostÃ³v did not know or remember how he ran to his place and mounted.
 14449	Instantly his regret at not having been in action and his dejected mood
 14450	amid people of whom he was weary had gone, instantly every thought of
 14451	himself had vanished. He was filled with happiness at his nearness to
 14452	the Emperor. He felt that this nearness by itself made up to him for the
 14453	day he had lost. He was happy as a lover when the longed-for moment of
 14454	meeting arrives. Not daring to look round and without looking round, he
 14455	was ecstatically conscious of his approach. He felt it not only from the
 14456	sound of the hoofs of the approaching cavalcade, but because as he drew
 14457	near everything grew brighter, more joyful, more significant, and more
 14458	festive around him. Nearer and nearer to RostÃ³v came that sun shedding
 14459	beams of mild and majestic light around, and already he felt himself
 14460	enveloped in those beams, he heard his voice, that kindly, calm,
 14461	and majestic voice that was yet so simple! And as if in accord with
 14462	RostÃ³vâs feeling, there was a deathly stillness amid which was heard
 14463	the Emperorâs voice.
 14464	
 14465	âThe PÃ¡vlograd hussars?â he inquired.
 14466	
 14467	âThe reserves, sire!â replied a voice, a very human one compared to
 14468	that which had said: âThe PÃ¡vlograd hussars?â
 14469	
 14470	The Emperor drew level with RostÃ³v and halted. Alexanderâs face was
 14471	even more beautiful than it had been three days before at the review. It
 14472	shone with such gaiety and youth, such innocent youth, that it suggested
 14473	the liveliness of a fourteen-year-old boy, and yet it was the face
 14474	of the majestic Emperor. Casually, while surveying the squadron, the
 14475	Emperorâs eyes met RostÃ³vâs and rested on them for not more than
 14476	two seconds. Whether or no the Emperor understood what was going on in
 14477	RostÃ³vâs soul (it seemed to RostÃ³v that he understood everything),
 14478	at any rate his light-blue eyes gazed for about two seconds into
 14479	RostÃ³vâs face. A gentle, mild light poured from them. Then all at
 14480	once he raised his eyebrows, abruptly touched his horse with his left
 14481	foot, and galloped on.
 14482	
 14483	The younger Emperor could not restrain his wish to be present at the
 14484	battle and, in spite of the remonstrances of his courtiers, at twelve
 14485	oâclock left the third column with which he had been and galloped
 14486	toward the vanguard. Before he came up with the hussars, several
 14487	adjutants met him with news of the successful result of the action.
 14488	
 14489	This battle, which consisted in the capture of a French squadron, was
 14490	represented as a brilliant victory over the French, and so the
 14491	Emperor and the whole army, especially while the smoke hung over
 14492	the battlefield, believed that the French had been defeated and were
 14493	retreating against their will. A few minutes after the Emperor had
 14494	passed, the PÃ¡vlograd division was ordered to advance. In Wischau
 14495	itself, a petty German town, RostÃ³v saw the Emperor again. In the
 14496	market place, where there had been some rather heavy firing before the
 14497	Emperorâs arrival, lay several killed and wounded soldiers whom there
 14498	had not been time to move. The Emperor, surrounded by his suite
 14499	of officers and courtiers, was riding a bobtailed chestnut mare, a
 14500	different one from that which he had ridden at the review, and bending
 14501	to one side he gracefully held a gold lorgnette to his eyes and looked
 14502	at a soldier who lay prone, with blood on his uncovered head. The
 14503	wounded soldier was so dirty, coarse, and revolting that his proximity
 14504	to the Emperor shocked RostÃ³v. RostÃ³v saw how the Emperorâs rather
 14505	round shoulders shuddered as if a cold shiver had run down them, how his
 14506	left foot began convulsively tapping the horseâs side with the spur,
 14507	and how the well-trained horse looked round unconcerned and did not
 14508	stir. An adjutant, dismounting, lifted the soldier under the arms to
 14509	place him on a stretcher that had been brought. The soldier groaned.
 14510	
 14511	âGently, gently! Canât you do it more gently?â said the Emperor
 14512	apparently suffering more than the dying soldier, and he rode away.
 14513	
 14514	RostÃ³v saw tears filling the Emperorâs eyes and heard him, as he was
 14515	riding away, say to CzartorÃ½ski: âWhat a terrible thing war is: what
 14516	a terrible thing! Quelle terrible chose que la guerre!â
 14517	
 14518	The troops of the vanguard were stationed before Wischau, within sight
 14519	of the enemyâs lines, which all day long had yielded ground to us
 14520	at the least firing. The Emperorâs gratitude was announced to the
 14521	vanguard, rewards were promised, and the men received a double ration of
 14522	vodka. The campfires crackled and the soldiersâ songs resounded
 14523	even more merrily than on the previous night. DenÃ­sov celebrated his
 14524	promotion to the rank of major, and RostÃ³v, who had already drunk
 14525	enough, at the end of the feast proposed the Emperorâs health. âNot
 14526	âour Sovereign, the Emperor,â as they say at official dinners,â
 14527	said he, âbut the health of our Sovereign, that good, enchanting, and
 14528	great man! Let us drink to his health and to the certain defeat of the
 14529	French!â
 14530	
 14531	âIf we fought before,â he said, ânot letting the French pass, as
 14532	at SchÃ¶n Grabern, what shall we not do now when he is at the front? We
 14533	will all die for him gladly! Is it not so, gentlemen? Perhaps I am not
 14534	saying it right, I have drunk a good dealâbut that is how I feel, and
 14535	so do you too! To the health of Alexander the First! Hurrah!â
 14536	
 14537	âHurrah!â rang the enthusiastic voices of the officers.
 14538	
 14539	And the old cavalry captain, KÃ­rsten, shouted enthusiastically and no
 14540	less sincerely than the twenty-year-old RostÃ³v.
 14541	
 14542	When the officers had emptied and smashed their glasses, KÃ­rsten filled
 14543	others and, in shirt sleeves and breeches, went glass in hand to the
 14544	soldiersâ bonfires and with his long gray mustache, his white chest
 14545	showing under his open shirt, he stood in a majestic pose in the light
 14546	of the campfire, waving his uplifted arm.
 14547	
 14548	âLads! hereâs to our Sovereign, the Emperor, and victory over
 14549	our enemies! Hurrah!â he exclaimed in his dashing, old, hussarâs
 14550	baritone.
 14551	
 14552	The hussars crowded round and responded heartily with loud shouts.
 14553	
 14554	Late that night, when all had separated, DenÃ­sov with his short hand
 14555	patted his favorite, RostÃ³v, on the shoulder.
 14556	
 14557	âAs thereâs no one to fall in love with on campaign, heâs fallen
 14558	in love with the Tsar,â he said.
 14559	
 14560	âDenÃ­sov, donât make fun of it!â cried RostÃ³v. âIt is such a
 14561	lofty, beautiful feeling, such a...â
 14562	
 14563	âI believe it, I believe it, fwiend, and I share and appwove...â
 14564	
 14565	âNo, you donât understand!â
 14566	
 14567	And RostÃ³v got up and went wandering among the campfires, dreaming of
 14568	what happiness it would be to dieânot in saving the Emperorâs life
 14569	(he did not even dare to dream of that), but simply to die before his
 14570	eyes. He really was in love with the Tsar and the glory of the Russian
 14571	arms and the hope of future triumph. And he was not the only man to
 14572	experience that feeling during those memorable days preceding the battle
 14573	of Austerlitz: nine tenths of the men in the Russian army were then in
 14574	love, though less ecstatically, with their Tsar and the glory of the
 14575	Russian arms.
 14576	
 14577	
 14578

 14581	CHAPTER XI
 14582	
 14583	The next day the Emperor stopped at Wischau, and Villier, his physician,
 14584	was repeatedly summoned to see him. At headquarters and among the troops
 14585	near by the news spread that the Emperor was unwell. He ate nothing and
 14586	had slept badly that night, those around him reported. The cause of this
 14587	indisposition was the strong impression made on his sensitive mind by
 14588	the sight of the killed and wounded.
 14589	
 14590	At daybreak on the seventeenth, a French officer who had come with
 14591	a flag of truce, demanding an audience with the Russian Emperor, was
 14592	brought into Wischau from our outposts. This officer was Savary. The
 14593	Emperor had only just fallen asleep and so Savary had to wait. At midday
 14594	he was admitted to the Emperor, and an hour later he rode off with
 14595	Prince DolgorÃºkov to the advanced post of the French army.
 14596	
 14597	It was rumored that Savary had been sent to propose to Alexander
 14598	a meeting with Napoleon. To the joy and pride of the whole army, a
 14599	personal interview was refused, and instead of the Sovereign, Prince
 14600	DolgorÃºkov, the victor at Wischau, was sent with Savary to negotiate
 14601	with Napoleon if, contrary to expectations, these negotiations were
 14602	actuated by a real desire for peace.
 14603	
 14604	Toward evening DolgorÃºkov came back, went straight to the Tsar, and
 14605	remained alone with him for a long time.
 14606	
 14607	On the eighteenth and nineteenth of November, the army advanced two
 14608	daysâ march and the enemyâs outposts after a brief interchange
 14609	of shots retreated. In the highest army circles from midday on the
 14610	nineteenth, a great, excitedly bustling activity began which lasted till
 14611	the morning of the twentieth, when the memorable battle of Austerlitz
 14612	was fought.
 14613	
 14614	Till midday on the nineteenth, the activityâthe eager talk, running to
 14615	and fro, and dispatching of adjutantsâwas confined to the Emperorâs
 14616	headquarters. But on the afternoon of that day, this activity reached
 14617	KutÃºzovâs headquarters and the staffs of the commanders of columns.
 14618	By evening, the adjutants had spread it to all ends and parts of the
 14619	army, and in the night from the nineteenth to the twentieth, the whole
 14620	eighty thousand allied troops rose from their bivouacs to the hum of
 14621	voices, and the army swayed and started in one enormous mass six miles
 14622	long.
 14623	
 14624	The concentrated activity which had begun at the Emperorâs
 14625	headquarters in the morning and had started the whole movement that
 14626	followed was like the first movement of the main wheel of a large tower
 14627	clock. One wheel slowly moved, another was set in motion, and a third,
 14628	and wheels began to revolve faster and faster, levers and cogwheels to
 14629	work, chimes to play, figures to pop out, and the hands to advance with
 14630	regular motion as a result of all that activity.
 14631	
 14632	Just as in the mechanism of a clock, so in the mechanism of the military
 14633	machine, an impulse once given leads to the final result; and just as
 14634	indifferently quiescent till the moment when motion is transmitted
 14635	to them are the parts of the mechanism which the impulse has not yet
 14636	reached. Wheels creak on their axles as the cogs engage one another and
 14637	the revolving pulleys whirr with the rapidity of their movement, but a
 14638	neighboring wheel is as quiet and motionless as though it were prepared
 14639	to remain so for a hundred years; but the moment comes when the lever
 14640	catches it and obeying the impulse that wheel begins to creak and joins
 14641	in the common motion the result and aim of which are beyond its ken.
 14642	
 14643	Just as in a clock, the result of the complicated motion of innumerable
 14644	wheels and pulleys is merely a slow and regular movement of the
 14645	hands which show the time, so the result of all the complicated human
 14646	activities of 160,000 Russians and Frenchâall their passions, desires,
 14647	remorse, humiliations, sufferings, outbursts of pride, fear, and
 14648	enthusiasmâwas only the loss of the battle of Austerlitz, the
 14649	so-called battle of the three Emperorsâthat is to say, a slow movement
 14650	of the hand on the dial of human history.
 14651	
 14652	Prince Andrew was on duty that day and in constant attendance on the
 14653	commander in chief.
 14654	
 14655	At six in the evening, KutÃºzov went to the Emperorâs headquarters
 14656	and after staying but a short time with the Tsar went to see the grand
 14657	marshal of the court, Count TolstÃ³y.
 14658	
 14659	BolkÃ³nski took the opportunity to go in to get some details of the
 14660	coming action from DolgorÃºkov. He felt that KutÃºzov was upset
 14661	and dissatisfied about something and that at headquarters they were
 14662	dissatisfied with him, and also that at the Emperorâs headquarters
 14663	everyone adopted toward him the tone of men who know something others do
 14664	not know: he therefore wished to speak to DolgorÃºkov.
 14665	
 14666	âWell, how dâyou do, my dear fellow?â said DolgorÃºkov, who was
 14667	sitting at tea with BilÃ­bin. âThe fete is for tomorrow. How is your
 14668	old fellow? Out of sorts?â
 14669	
 14670	âI wonât say he is out of sorts, but I fancy he would like to be
 14671	heard.â
 14672	
 14673	âBut they heard him at the council of war and will hear him when he
 14674	talks sense, but to temporize and wait for something now when Bonaparte
 14675	fears nothing so much as a general battle is impossible.â
 14676	
 14677	âYes, you have seen him?â said Prince Andrew. âWell, what is
 14678	Bonaparte like? How did he impress you?â
 14679	
 14680	âYes, I saw him, and am convinced that he fears nothing so much as
 14681	a general engagement,â repeated DolgorÃºkov, evidently prizing this
 14682	general conclusion which he had arrived at from his interview with
 14683	Napoleon. âIf he werenât afraid of a battle why did he ask for that
 14684	interview? Why negotiate, and above all why retreat, when to retreat is
 14685	so contrary to his method of conducting war? Believe me, he is afraid,
 14686	afraid of a general battle. His hour has come! Mark my words!â
 14687	
 14688	âBut tell me, what is he like, eh?â said Prince Andrew again.
 14689	
 14690	âHe is a man in a gray overcoat, very anxious that I should call
 14691	him âYour Majesty,â but who, to his chagrin, got no title from
 14692	me! Thatâs the sort of man he is, and nothing more,â replied
 14693	DolgorÃºkov, looking round at BilÃ­bin with a smile.
 14694	
 14695	âDespite my great respect for old KutÃºzov,â he continued, âwe
 14696	should be a nice set of fellows if we were to wait about and so give him
 14697	a chance to escape, or to trick us, now that we certainly have him in
 14698	our hands! No, we mustnât forget SuvÃ³rov and his ruleânot to put
 14699	yourself in a position to be attacked, but yourself to attack. Believe
 14700	me in war the energy of young men often shows the way better than all
 14701	the experience of old Cunctators.â
 14702	
 14703	âBut in what position are we going to attack him? I have been at the
 14704	outposts today and it is impossible to say where his chief forces are
 14705	situated,â said Prince Andrew.
 14706	
 14707	He wished to explain to DolgorÃºkov a plan of attack he had himself
 14708	formed.
 14709	
 14710	âOh, that is all the same,â DolgorÃºkov said quickly, and getting up
 14711	he spread a map on the table. âAll eventualities have been foreseen.
 14712	If he is standing before BrÃ¼nn...â
 14713	
 14714	And Prince DolgorÃºkov rapidly but indistinctly explained Weyrotherâs
 14715	plan of a flanking movement.
 14716	
 14717	Prince Andrew began to reply and to state his own plan, which might
 14718	have been as good as Weyrotherâs, but for the disadvantage that
 14719	Weyrotherâs had already been approved. As soon as Prince Andrew began
 14720	to demonstrate the defects of the latter and the merits of his own plan,
 14721	Prince DolgorÃºkov ceased to listen to him and gazed absent-mindedly not
 14722	at the map, but at Prince Andrewâs face.
 14723	
 14724	âThere will be a council of war at KutÃºzovâs tonight, though; you
 14725	can say all this there,â remarked DolgorÃºkov.
 14726	
 14727	âI will do so,â said Prince Andrew, moving away from the map.
 14728	
 14729	âWhatever are you bothering about, gentlemen?â said BilÃ­bin, who,
 14730	till then, had listened with an amused smile to their conversation and
 14731	now was evidently ready with a joke. âWhether tomorrow brings
 14732	victory or defeat, the glory of our Russian arms is secure. Except your
 14733	KutÃºzov, there is not a single Russian in command of a column! The
 14734	commanders are: Herr General Wimpfen, le Comte de Langeron, le Prince de
 14735	Lichtenstein, le Prince, de Hohenlohe, and finally Prishprish, and so on
 14736	like all those Polish names.â
 14737	
 14738	âBe quiet, backbiter!â said DolgorÃºkov. âIt is not true; there
 14739	are now two Russians, MilorÃ¡dovich, and DokhtÃºrov, and there would be
 14740	a third, Count ArakchÃ©ev, if his nerves were not too weak.â
 14741	
 14742	âHowever, I think General KutÃºzov has come out,â said Prince
 14743	Andrew. âI wish you good luck and success, gentlemen!â he added and
 14744	went out after shaking hands with DolgorÃºkov and BilÃ­bin.
 14745	
 14746	On the way home, Prince Andrew could not refrain from asking KutÃºzov,
 14747	who was sitting silently beside him, what he thought of tomorrowâs
 14748	battle.
 14749	
 14750	KutÃºzov looked sternly at his adjutant and, after a pause, replied:
 14751	âI think the battle will be lost, and so I told Count TolstÃ³y and
 14752	asked him to tell the Emperor. What do you think he replied? âBut, my
 14753	dear general, I am engaged with rice and cutlets, look after military
 14754	matters yourself!â Yes... That was the answer I got!â
 14755	
 14756	
 14757	
 14758	
 14759	
 14760	CHAPTER XII
 14761	
 14762	Shortly after nine oâclock that evening, Weyrother drove with his
 14763	plans to KutÃºzovâs quarters where the council of war was to be
 14764	held. All the commanders of columns were summoned to the commander in
 14765	chiefâs and with the exception of Prince BagratiÃ³n, who declined to
 14766	come, were all there at the appointed time.
 14767	
 14768	Weyrother, who was in full control of the proposed battle, by his
 14769	eagerness and briskness presented a marked contrast to the dissatisfied
 14770	and drowsy KutÃºzov, who reluctantly played the part of chairman and
 14771	president of the council of war. Weyrother evidently felt himself to be
 14772	at the head of a movement that had already become unrestrainable. He was
 14773	like a horse running downhill harnessed to a heavy cart. Whether he was
 14774	pulling it or being pushed by it he did not know, but rushed along at
 14775	headlong speed with no time to consider what this movement might lead
 14776	to. Weyrother had been twice that evening to the enemyâs picket
 14777	line to reconnoiter personally, and twice to the Emperors, Russian and
 14778	Austrian, to report and explain, and to his headquarters where he had
 14779	dictated the dispositions in German, and now, much exhausted, he arrived
 14780	at KutÃºzovâs.
 14781	
 14782	He was evidently so busy that he even forgot to be polite to the
 14783	commander in chief. He interrupted him, talked rapidly and indistinctly,
 14784	without looking at the man he was addressing, and did not reply to
 14785	questions put to him. He was bespattered with mud and had a pitiful,
 14786	weary, and distracted air, though at the same time he was haughty and
 14787	self-confident.
 14788	
 14789	KutÃºzov was occupying a noblemanâs castle of modest dimensions near
 14790	Ostralitz. In the large drawing room which had become the commander
 14791	in chiefâs office were gathered KutÃºzov himself, Weyrother, and the
 14792	members of the council of war. They were drinking tea, and only awaited
 14793	Prince BagratiÃ³n to begin the council. At last BagratiÃ³nâs orderly
 14794	came with the news that the prince could not attend. Prince Andrew came
 14795	in to inform the commander in chief of this and, availing himself
 14796	of permission previously given him by KutÃºzov to be present at the
 14797	council, he remained in the room.
 14798	
 14799	âSince Prince BagratiÃ³n is not coming, we may begin,â said
 14800	Weyrother, hurriedly rising from his seat and going up to the table on
 14801	which an enormous map of the environs of BrÃ¼nn was spread out.
 14802	
 14803	KutÃºzov, with his uniform unbuttoned so that his fat neck bulged over
 14804	his collar as if escaping, was sitting almost asleep in a low chair,
 14805	with his podgy old hands resting symmetrically on its arms. At the sound
 14806	of Weyrotherâs voice, he opened his one eye with an effort.
 14807	
 14808	âYes, yes, if you please! It is already late,â said he, and nodding
 14809	his head he let it droop and again closed his eye.
 14810	
 14811	If at first the members of the council thought that KutÃºzov was
 14812	pretending to sleep, the sounds his nose emitted during the reading that
 14813	followed proved that the commander in chief at that moment was absorbed
 14814	by a far more serious matter than a desire to show his contempt for
 14815	the dispositions or anything elseâhe was engaged in satisfying the
 14816	irresistible human need for sleep. He really was asleep. Weyrother, with
 14817	the gesture of a man too busy to lose a moment, glanced at KutÃºzov and,
 14818	having convinced himself that he was asleep, took up a paper and in
 14819	a loud, monotonous voice began to read out the dispositions for the
 14820	impending battle, under a heading which he also read out:
 14821	
 14822	âDispositions for an attack on the enemy position behind Kobelnitz and
 14823	Sokolnitz, November 30, 1805.â
 14824	
 14825	The dispositions were very complicated and difficult. They began as
 14826	follows:
 14827	
 14828	âAs the enemyâs left wing rests on wooded hills and his right
 14829	extends along Kobelnitz and Sokolnitz behind the ponds that are there,
 14830	while we, on the other hand, with our left wing by far outflank his
 14831	right, it is advantageous to attack the enemyâs latter wing especially
 14832	if we occupy the villages of Sokolnitz and Kobelnitz, whereby we
 14833	can both fall on his flank and pursue him over the plain between
 14834	Schlappanitz and the Thuerassa forest, avoiding the defiles of
 14835	Schlappanitz and Bellowitz which cover the enemyâs front. For this
 14836	object it is necessary that... The first column marches... The second
 14837	column marches... The third column marches...â and so on, read
 14838	Weyrother.
 14839	
 14840	The generals seemed to listen reluctantly to the difficult dispositions.
 14841	The tall, fair-haired General BuxhÃ¶wden stood, leaning his back against
 14842	the wall, his eyes fixed on a burning candle, and seemed not to listen
 14843	or even to wish to be thought to listen. Exactly opposite Weyrother,
 14844	with his glistening wide-open eyes fixed upon him and his mustache
 14845	twisted upwards, sat the ruddy MilorÃ¡dovich in a military pose, his
 14846	elbows turned outwards, his hands on his knees, and his shoulders
 14847	raised. He remained stubbornly silent, gazing at Weyrotherâs face,
 14848	and only turned away his eyes when the Austrian chief of staff finished
 14849	reading. Then MilorÃ¡dovich looked round significantly at the other
 14850	generals. But one could not tell from that significant look whether he
 14851	agreed or disagreed and was satisfied or not with the arrangements. Next
 14852	to Weyrother sat Count Langeron who, with a subtle smile that never left
 14853	his typically southern French face during the whole time of the reading,
 14854	gazed at his delicate fingers which rapidly twirled by its corners
 14855	a gold snuffbox on which was a portrait. In the middle of one of the
 14856	longest sentences, he stopped the rotary motion of the snuffbox, raised
 14857	his head, and with inimical politeness lurking in the corners of his
 14858	thin lips interrupted Weyrother, wishing to say something. But the
 14859	Austrian general, continuing to read, frowned angrily and jerked his
 14860	elbows, as if to say: âYou can tell me your views later, but now be so
 14861	good as to look at the map and listen.â Langeron lifted his eyes with
 14862	an expression of perplexity, turned round to MilorÃ¡dovich as if seeking
 14863	an explanation, but meeting the latterâs impressive but meaningless
 14864	gaze drooped his eyes sadly and again took to twirling his snuffbox.
 14865	
 14866	âA geography lesson!â he muttered as if to himself, but loud enough
 14867	to be heard.
 14868	
 14869	PrzebyszÃ©wski, with respectful but dignified politeness, held his
 14870	hand to his ear toward Weyrother, with the air of a man absorbed in
 14871	attention. DohktÃºrov, a little man, sat opposite Weyrother, with
 14872	an assiduous and modest mien, and stooping over the outspread map
 14873	conscientiously studied the dispositions and the unfamiliar locality. He
 14874	asked Weyrother several times to repeat words he had not clearly heard
 14875	and the difficult names of villages. Weyrother complied and DohktÃºrov
 14876	noted them down.
 14877	
 14878	When the reading which lasted more than an hour was over, Langeron again
 14879	brought his snuffbox to rest and, without looking at Weyrother or at
 14880	anyone in particular, began to say how difficult it was to carry out
 14881	such a plan in which the enemyâs position was assumed to be known,
 14882	whereas it was perhaps not known, since the enemy was in movement.
 14883	Langeronâs objections were valid but it was obvious that their chief
 14884	aim was to show General Weyrotherâwho had read his dispositions with
 14885	as much self-confidence as if he were addressing school childrenâthat
 14886	he had to do, not with fools, but with men who could teach him something
 14887	in military matters.
 14888	
 14889	When the monotonous sound of Weyrotherâs voice ceased, KutÃºzov opened
 14890	his eye as a miller wakes up when the soporific drone of the mill wheel
 14891	is interrupted. He listened to what Langeron said, as if remarking,
 14892	âSo you are still at that silly business!â quickly closed his eye
 14893	again, and let his head sink still lower.
 14894	
 14895	Langeron, trying as virulently as possible to sting Weyrotherâs vanity
 14896	as author of the military plan, argued that Bonaparte might easily
 14897	attack instead of being attacked, and so render the whole of this
 14898	plan perfectly worthless. Weyrother met all objections with a firm and
 14899	contemptuous smile, evidently prepared beforehand to meet all objections
 14900	be they what they might.
 14901	
 14902	âIf he could attack us, he would have done so today,â said he.
 14903	
 14904	âSo you think he is powerless?â said Langeron.
 14905	
 14906	âHe has forty thousand men at most,â replied Weyrother, with the
 14907	smile of a doctor to whom an old wife wishes to explain the treatment of
 14908	a case.
 14909	
 14910	âIn that case he is inviting his doom by awaiting our attack,â said
 14911	Langeron, with a subtly ironical smile, again glancing round for support
 14912	to MilorÃ¡dovich who was near him.
 14913	
 14914	But MilorÃ¡dovich was at that moment evidently thinking of anything
 14915	rather than of what the generals were disputing about.
 14916	
 14917	âMa foi!â said he, âtomorrow we shall see all that on the
 14918	battlefield.â
 14919	
 14920	Weyrother again gave that smile which seemed to say that to him it was
 14921	strange and ridiculous to meet objections from Russian generals and to
 14922	have to prove to them what he had not merely convinced himself of, but
 14923	had also convinced the sovereign Emperors of.
 14924	
 14925	âThe enemy has quenched his fires and a continual noise is heard from
 14926	his camp,â said he. âWhat does that mean? Either he is retreating,
 14927	which is the only thing we need fear, or he is changing his position.â
 14928	(He smiled ironically.) âBut even if he also took up a position in
 14929	the Thuerassa, he merely saves us a great deal of trouble and all our
 14930	arrangements to the minutest detail remain the same.â
 14931	
 14932	âHow is that?...â began Prince Andrew, who had for long been waiting
 14933	an opportunity to express his doubts.
 14934	
 14935	KutÃºzov here woke up, coughed heavily, and looked round at the
 14936	generals.
 14937	
 14938	âGentlemen, the dispositions for tomorrowâor rather for today, for
 14939	it is past midnightâcannot now be altered,â said he. âYou have
 14940	heard them, and we shall all do our duty. But before a battle, there is
 14941	nothing more important...â he paused, âthan to have a good sleep.â
 14942	
 14943	He moved as if to rise. The generals bowed and retired. It was past
 14944	midnight. Prince Andrew went out.
 14945	
 14946	The council of war, at which Prince Andrew had not been able to
 14947	express his opinion as he had hoped to, left on him a vague and uneasy
 14948	impression. Whether DolgorÃºkov and Weyrother, or KutÃºzov, Langeron,
 14949	and the others who did not approve of the plan of attack, were
 14950	rightâhe did not know. âBut was it really not possible for KutÃºzov
 14951	to state his views plainly to the Emperor? Is it possible that on
 14952	account of court and personal considerations tens of thousands of lives,
 14953	and my life, my life,â he thought, âmust be risked?â
 14954	
 14955	âYes, it is very likely that I shall be killed tomorrow,â he
 14956	thought. And suddenly, at this thought of death, a whole series of most
 14957	distant, most intimate, memories rose in his imagination: he remembered
 14958	his last parting from his father and his wife; he remembered the days
 14959	when he first loved her. He thought of her pregnancy and felt sorry for
 14960	her and for himself, and in a nervously emotional and softened mood he
 14961	went out of the hut in which he was billeted with NesvÃ­tski and began
 14962	to walk up and down before it.
 14963	
 14964	The night was foggy and through the fog the moonlight gleamed
 14965	mysteriously. âYes, tomorrow, tomorrow!â he thought. âTomorrow
 14966	everything may be over for me! All these memories will be no more, none
 14967	of them will have any meaning for me. Tomorrow perhaps, even certainly,
 14968	I have a presentiment that for the first time I shall have to show all
 14969	I can do.â And his fancy pictured the battle, its loss, the
 14970	concentration of fighting at one point, and the hesitation of all the
 14971	commanders. And then that happy moment, that Toulon for which he had
 14972	so long waited, presents itself to him at last. He firmly and clearly
 14973	expresses his opinion to KutÃºzov, to Weyrother, and to the Emperors.
 14974	All are struck by the justness of his views, but no one undertakes to
 14975	carry them out, so he takes a regiment, a divisionâstipulates that no
 14976	one is to interfere with his arrangementsâleads his division to
 14977	the decisive point, and gains the victory alone. âBut death and
 14978	suffering?â suggested another voice. Prince Andrew, however, did not
 14979	answer that voice and went on dreaming of his triumphs. The dispositions
 14980	for the next battle are planned by him alone. Nominally he is only an
 14981	adjutant on KutÃºzovâs staff, but he does everything alone. The next
 14982	battle is won by him alone. KutÃºzov is removed and he is appointed...
 14983	âWell and then?â asked the other voice. âIf before that you are
 14984	not ten times wounded, killed, or betrayed, well... what then?...â
 14985	âWell then,â Prince Andrew answered himself, âI donât know
 14986	what will happen and donât want to know, and canât, but if I want
 14987	thisâwant glory, want to be known to men, want to be loved by them, it
 14988	is not my fault that I want it and want nothing but that and live only
 14989	for that. Yes, for that alone! I shall never tell anyone, but, oh God!
 14990	what am I to do if I love nothing but fame and menâs esteem? Death,
 14991	wounds, the loss of familyâI fear nothing. And precious and dear
 14992	as many persons are to meâfather, sister, wifeâthose dearest to
 14993	meâyet dreadful and unnatural as it seems, I would give them all at
 14994	once for a moment of glory, of triumph over men, of love from men I
 14995	donât know and never shall know, for the love of these men here,â he
 14996	thought, as he listened to voices in KutÃºzovâs courtyard. The voices
 14997	were those of the orderlies who were packing up; one voice, probably a
 14998	coachmanâs, was teasing KutÃºzovâs old cook whom Prince Andrew knew,
 14999	and who was called Tit. He was saying, âTit, I say, Tit!â
 15000	
 15001	âWell?â returned the old man.
 15002	
 15003	âGo, Tit, thresh a bit!â said the wag.
 15004	
 15005	âOh, go to the devil!â called out a voice, drowned by the laughter
 15006	of the orderlies and servants.
 15007	
 15008	âAll the same, I love and value nothing but triumph over them all, I
 15009	value this mystic power and glory that is floating here above me in this
 15010	mist!â
 15011	
 15012	
 15013	
 15014	
 15015	
 15016	CHAPTER XIII
 15017	
 15018	That same night, RostÃ³v was with a platoon on skirmishing duty in front
 15019	of BagratiÃ³nâs detachment. His hussars were placed along the line
 15020	in couples and he himself rode along the line trying to master the
 15021	sleepiness that kept coming over him. An enormous space, with our
 15022	armyâs campfires dimly glowing in the fog, could be seen behind him;
 15023	in front of him was misty darkness. RostÃ³v could see nothing, peer as
 15024	he would into that foggy distance: now something gleamed gray, now there
 15025	was something black, now little lights seemed to glimmer where the enemy
 15026	ought to be, now he fancied it was only something in his own eyes. His
 15027	eyes kept closing, and in his fancy appearedânow the Emperor, now
 15028	DenÃ­sov, and now Moscow memoriesâand he again hurriedly opened his
 15029	eyes and saw close before him the head and ears of the horse he was
 15030	riding, and sometimes, when he came within six paces of them, the
 15031	black figures of hussars, but in the distance was still the same misty
 15032	darkness. âWhy not?... It might easily happen,â thought RostÃ³v,
 15033	âthat the Emperor will meet me and give me an order as he would to any
 15034	other officer; heâll say: âGo and find out whatâs there.â There
 15035	are many stories of his getting to know an officer in just such a chance
 15036	way and attaching him to himself! What if he gave me a place near him?
 15037	Oh, how I would guard him, how I would tell him the truth, how I would
 15038	unmask his deceivers!â And in order to realize vividly his love
 15039	devotion to the sovereign, RostÃ³v pictured to himself an enemy or a
 15040	deceitful German, whom he would not only kill with pleasure but whom
 15041	he would slap in the face before the Emperor. Suddenly a distant shout
 15042	aroused him. He started and opened his eyes.
 15043	
 15044	âWhere am I? Oh yes, in the skirmishing line... pass and
 15045	watchwordâshaft, OlmÃ¼tz. What a nuisance that our squadron will be in
 15046	reserve tomorrow,â he thought. âIâll ask leave to go to the front,
 15047	this may be my only chance of seeing the Emperor. It wonât be long
 15048	now before I am off duty. Iâll take another turn and when I get back
 15049	Iâll go to the general and ask him.â He readjusted himself in the
 15050	saddle and touched up his horse to ride once more round his hussars. It
 15051	seemed to him that it was getting lighter. To the left he saw a sloping
 15052	descent lit up, and facing it a black knoll that seemed as steep as a
 15053	wall. On this knoll there was a white patch that RostÃ³v could not at
 15054	all make out: was it a glade in the wood lit up by the moon, or some
 15055	unmelted snow, or some white houses? He even thought something moved on
 15056	that white spot. âI expect itâs snow... that spot... a spotâune
 15057	tache,â he thought. âThere now... itâs not a tache... NatÃ¡sha...
 15058	sister, black eyes... Na... tasha... (Wonât she be surprised when
 15059	I tell her how Iâve seen the Emperor?) NatÃ¡sha... take my
 15060	sabretache...âââKeep to the right, your honor, there are bushes
 15061	here,â came the voice of an hussar, past whom RostÃ³v was riding in
 15062	the act of falling asleep. RostÃ³v lifted his head that had sunk almost
 15063	to his horseâs mane and pulled up beside the hussar. He was succumbing
 15064	to irresistible, youthful, childish drowsiness. âBut what was I
 15065	thinking? I mustnât forget. How shall I speak to the Emperor? No,
 15066	thatâs not itâthatâs tomorrow. Oh yes! NatÃ¡sha... sabretache...
 15067	saber them... Whom? The hussars... Ah, the hussars with mustaches. Along
 15068	the TverskÃ¡ya Street rode the hussar with mustaches... I thought about
 15069	him too, just opposite GÃºryevâs house... Old GÃºryev.... Oh, but
 15070	DenÃ­sovâs a fine fellow. But thatâs all nonsense. The chief thing
 15071	is that the Emperor is here. How he looked at me and wished to say
 15072	something, but dared not.... No, it was I who dared not. But thatâs
 15073	nonsense, the chief thing is not to forget the important thing I
 15074	was thinking of. Yes, Na-tÃ¡sha, sabretache, oh, yes, yes! Thatâs
 15075	right!â And his head once more sank to his horseâs neck. All at once
 15076	it seemed to him that he was being fired at. âWhat? What? What?... Cut
 15077	them down! What?...â said RostÃ³v, waking up. At the moment he opened
 15078	his eyes he heard in front of him, where the enemy was, the long-drawn
 15079	shouts of thousands of voices. His horse and the horse of the hussar
 15080	near him pricked their ears at these shouts. Over there, where the
 15081	shouting came from, a fire flared up and went out again, then another,
 15082	and all along the French line on the hill fires flared up and the
 15083	shouting grew louder and louder. RostÃ³v could hear the sound of French
 15084	words but could not distinguish them. The din of many voices was too
 15085	great; all he could hear was: âahahah!â and ârrrr!â
 15086	
 15087	âWhatâs that? What do you make of it?â said RostÃ³v to the hussar
 15088	beside him. âThat must be the enemyâs camp!â
 15089	
 15090	The hussar did not reply.
 15091	
 15092	âWhy, donât you hear it?â RostÃ³v asked again, after waiting for a
 15093	reply.
 15094	
 15095	âWho can tell, your honor?â replied the hussar reluctantly.
 15096	
 15097	âFrom the direction, it must be the enemy,â repeated RostÃ³v.
 15098	
 15099	âIt may be he or it may be nothing,â muttered the hussar. âItâs
 15100	dark... Steady!â he cried to his fidgeting horse.
 15101	
 15102	RostÃ³vâs horse was also getting restive: it pawed the frozen ground,
 15103	pricking its ears at the noise and looking at the lights. The shouting
 15104	grew still louder and merged into a general roar that only an army
 15105	of several thousand men could produce. The lights spread farther and
 15106	farther, probably along the line of the French camp. RostÃ³v no longer
 15107	wanted to sleep. The gay triumphant shouting of the enemy army had a
 15108	stimulating effect on him. âVive lâEmpereur! lâEmpereur!â he now
 15109	heard distinctly.
 15110	
 15111	âThey canât be far off, probably just beyond the stream,â he said
 15112	to the hussar beside him.
 15113	
 15114	The hussar only sighed without replying and coughed angrily. The sound
 15115	of horseâs hoofs approaching at a trot along the line of hussars was
 15116	heard, and out of the foggy darkness the figure of a sergeant of hussars
 15117	suddenly appeared, looming huge as an elephant.
 15118	
 15119	âYour honor, the generals!â said the sergeant, riding up to RostÃ³v.
 15120	
 15121	RostÃ³v, still looking round toward the fires and the shouts, rode with
 15122	the sergeant to meet some mounted men who were riding along the line.
 15123	One was on a white horse. Prince BagratiÃ³n and Prince DolgorÃºkov with
 15124	their adjutants had come to witness the curious phenomenon of the
 15125	lights and shouts in the enemyâs camp. RostÃ³v rode up to BagratiÃ³n,
 15126	reported to him, and then joined the adjutants listening to what the
 15127	generals were saying.
 15128	
 15129	âBelieve me,â said Prince DolgorÃºkov, addressing BagratiÃ³n, âit
 15130	is nothing but a trick! He has retreated and ordered the rearguard to
 15131	kindle fires and make a noise to deceive us.â
 15132	
 15133	âHardly,â said BagratiÃ³n. âI saw them this evening on that
 15134	knoll; if they had retreated they would have withdrawn from that too....
 15135	Officer!â said BagratiÃ³n to RostÃ³v, âare the enemyâs skirmishers
 15136	still there?â
 15137	
 15138	âThey were there this evening, but now I donât know, your
 15139	excellency. Shall I go with some of my hussars to see?â replied
 15140	RostÃ³v.
 15141	
 15142	BagratiÃ³n stopped and, before replying, tried to see RostÃ³vâs face
 15143	in the mist.
 15144	
 15145	âWell, go and see,â he said, after a pause.
 15146	
 15147	âYes, sir.â
 15148	
 15149	RostÃ³v spurred his horse, called to Sergeant FÃ©dchenko and two other
 15150	hussars, told them to follow him, and trotted downhill in the direction
 15151	from which the shouting came. He felt both frightened and pleased to be
 15152	riding alone with three hussars into that mysterious and dangerous misty
 15153	distance where no one had been before him. BagratiÃ³n called to him from
 15154	the hill not to go beyond the stream, but RostÃ³v pretended not to hear
 15155	him and did not stop but rode on and on, continually mistaking bushes
 15156	for trees and gullies for men and continually discovering his mistakes.
 15157	Having descended the hill at a trot, he no longer saw either our own or
 15158	the enemyâs fires, but heard the shouting of the French more loudly
 15159	and distinctly. In the valley he saw before him something like a river,
 15160	but when he reached it he found it was a road. Having come out onto
 15161	the road he reined in his horse, hesitating whether to ride along it or
 15162	cross it and ride over the black field up the hillside. To keep to the
 15163	road which gleamed white in the mist would have been safer because it
 15164	would be easier to see people coming along it. âFollow me!â said he,
 15165	crossed the road, and began riding up the hill at a gallop toward the
 15166	point where the French pickets had been standing that evening.
 15167	
 15168	âYour honor, there he is!â cried one of the hussars behind him. And
 15169	before RostÃ³v had time to make out what the black thing was that had
 15170	suddenly appeared in the fog, there was a flash, followed by a report,
 15171	and a bullet whizzing high up in the mist with a plaintive sound passed
 15172	out of hearing. Another musket missed fire but flashed in the pan.
 15173	RostÃ³v turned his horse and galloped back. Four more reports followed
 15174	at intervals, and the bullets passed somewhere in the fog singing in
 15175	different tones. RostÃ³v reined in his horse, whose spirits had risen,
 15176	like his own, at the firing, and went back at a footpace. âWell, some
 15177	more! Some more!â a merry voice was saying in his soul. But no more
 15178	shots came.
 15179	
 15180	Only when approaching BagratiÃ³n did RostÃ³v let his horse gallop again,
 15181	and with his hand at the salute rode up to the general.
 15182	
 15183	DolgorÃºkov was still insisting that the French had retreated and had
 15184	only lit fires to deceive us.
 15185	
 15186	âWhat does that prove?â he was saying as RostÃ³v rode up. âThey
 15187	might retreat and leave the pickets.â
 15188	
 15189	âItâs plain that they have not all gone yet, Prince,â said
 15190	BagratiÃ³n. âWait till tomorrow morning, weâll find out everything
 15191	tomorrow.â
 15192	
 15193	âThe picket is still on the hill, your excellency, just where it was
 15194	in the evening,â reported RostÃ³v, stooping forward with his hand at
 15195	the salute and unable to repress the smile of delight induced by his
 15196	ride and especially by the sound of the bullets.
 15197	
 15198	âVery good, very good,â said BagratiÃ³n. âThank you, officer.â
 15199	
 15200	âYour excellency,â said RostÃ³v, âmay I ask a favor?â
 15201	
 15202	âWhat is it?â
 15203	
 15204	âTomorrow our squadron is to be in reserve. May I ask to be attached
 15205	to the first squadron?â
 15206	
 15207	âWhatâs your name?â
 15208	
 15209	âCount RostÃ³v.â
 15210	
 15211	âOh, very well, you may stay in attendance on me.â
 15212	
 15213	âCount IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³vâs son?â asked DolgorÃºkov.
 15214	
 15215	But RostÃ³v did not reply.
 15216	
 15217	âThen I may reckon on it, your excellency?â
 15218	
 15219	âI will give the order.â
 15220	
 15221	âTomorrow very likely I may be sent with some message to the
 15222	Emperor,â thought RostÃ³v.
 15223	
 15224	âThank God!â
 15225	
 15226	The fires and shouting in the enemyâs army were occasioned by the fact
 15227	that while Napoleonâs proclamation was being read to the troops the
 15228	Emperor himself rode round his bivouacs. The soldiers, on seeing him,
 15229	lit wisps of straw and ran after him, shouting, âVive lâEmpereur!â
 15230	Napoleonâs proclamation was as follows:
 15231	
 15232	Soldiers! The Russian army is advancing against you to avenge the
 15233	Austrian army of Ulm. They are the same battalions you broke at
 15234	HollabrÃ¼nn and have pursued ever since to this place. The position we
 15235	occupy is a strong one, and while they are marching to go round me on
 15236	the right they will expose a flank to me. Soldiers! I will myself direct
 15237	your battalions. I will keep out of fire if you with your habitual
 15238	valor carry disorder and confusion into the enemyâs ranks, but should
 15239	victory be in doubt, even for a moment, you will see your Emperor
 15240	exposing himself to the first blows of the enemy, for there must be no
 15241	doubt of victory, especially on this day when what is at stake is the
 15242	honor of the French infantry, so necessary to the honor of our nation.
 15243	
 15244	Do not break your ranks on the plea of removing the wounded! Let every
 15245	man be fully imbued with the thought that we must defeat these hirelings
 15246	of England, inspired by such hatred of our nation! This victory will
 15247	conclude our campaign and we can return to winter quarters, where fresh
 15248	French troops who are being raised in France will join us, and the peace
 15249	I shall conclude will be worthy of my people, of you, and of myself.

 15256	CHAPTER XIV
 15257	
 15258	At five in the morning it was still quite dark. The troops of the
 15259	center, the reserves, and BagratiÃ³nâs right flank had not yet moved,
 15260	but on the left flank the columns of infantry, cavalry, and artillery,
 15261	which were to be the first to descend the heights to attack the French
 15262	right flank and drive it into the Bohemian mountains according to plan,
 15263	were already up and astir. The smoke of the campfires, into which they
 15264	were throwing everything superfluous, made the eyes smart. It was cold
 15265	and dark. The officers were hurriedly drinking tea and breakfasting, the
 15266	soldiers, munching biscuit and beating a tattoo with their feet to
 15267	warm themselves, gathering round the fires throwing into the flames the
 15268	remains of sheds, chairs, tables, wheels, tubs, and everything that they
 15269	did not want or could not carry away with them. Austrian column guides
 15270	were moving in and out among the Russian troops and served as heralds
 15271	of the advance. As soon as an Austrian officer showed himself near
 15272	a commanding officerâs quarters, the regiment began to move: the
 15273	soldiers ran from the fires, thrust their pipes into their boots, their
 15274	bags into the carts, got their muskets ready, and formed rank. The
 15275	officers buttoned up their coats, buckled on their swords and pouches,
 15276	and moved along the ranks shouting. The train drivers and orderlies
 15277	harnessed and packed the wagons and tied on the loads. The adjutants and
 15278	battalion and regimental commanders mounted, crossed themselves, gave
 15279	final instructions, orders, and commissions to the baggage men
 15280	who remained behind, and the monotonous tramp of thousands of feet
 15281	resounded. The column moved forward without knowing where and unable,
 15282	from the masses around them, the smoke and the increasing fog, to see
 15283	either the place they were leaving or that to which they were going.
 15284	
 15285	A soldier on the march is hemmed in and borne along by his regiment as
 15286	much as a sailor is by his ship. However far he has walked, whatever
 15287	strange, unknown, and dangerous places he reaches, just as a sailor is
 15288	always surrounded by the same decks, masts, and rigging of his ship, so
 15289	the soldier always has around him the same comrades, the same ranks, the
 15290	same sergeant major IvÃ¡n MÃ­trich, the same company dog Jack, and the
 15291	same commanders. The sailor rarely cares to know the latitude in which
 15292	his ship is sailing, but on the day of battleâheaven knows how and
 15293	whenceâa stern note of which all are conscious sounds in the moral
 15294	atmosphere of an army, announcing the approach of something decisive
 15295	and solemn, and awakening in the men an unusual curiosity. On the day of
 15296	battle the soldiers excitedly try to get beyond the interests of their
 15297	regiment, they listen intently, look about, and eagerly ask concerning
 15298	what is going on around them.
 15299	
 15300	The fog had grown so dense that though it was growing light they could
 15301	not see ten paces ahead. Bushes looked like gigantic trees and level
 15302	ground like cliffs and slopes. Anywhere, on any side, one might
 15303	encounter an enemy invisible ten paces off. But the columns advanced
 15304	for a long time, always in the same fog, descending and ascending hills,
 15305	avoiding gardens and enclosures, going over new and unknown ground, and
 15306	nowhere encountering the enemy. On the contrary, the soldiers became
 15307	aware that in front, behind, and on all sides, other Russian columns
 15308	were moving in the same direction. Every soldier felt glad to know that
 15309	to the unknown place where he was going, many more of our men were going
 15310	too.
 15311	
 15312	âThere now, the KÃºrskies have also gone past,â was being said in
 15313	the ranks.
 15314	
 15315	âItâs wonderful what a lot of our troops have gathered, lads! Last
 15316	night I looked at the campfires and there was no end of them. A regular
 15317	Moscow!â
 15318	
 15319	Though none of the column commanders rode up to the ranks or talked to
 15320	the men (the commanders, as we saw at the council of war, were out of
 15321	humor and dissatisfied with the affair, and so did not exert themselves
 15322	to cheer the men but merely carried out the orders), yet the troops
 15323	marched gaily, as they always do when going into action, especially to
 15324	an attack. But when they had marched for about an hour in the dense fog,
 15325	the greater part of the men had to halt and an unpleasant consciousness
 15326	of some dislocation and blunder spread through the ranks. How such
 15327	a consciousness is communicated is very difficult to define, but it
 15328	certainly is communicated very surely, and flows rapidly, imperceptibly,
 15329	and irrepressibly, as water does in a creek. Had the Russian army been
 15330	alone without any allies, it might perhaps have been a long time before
 15331	this consciousness of mismanagement became a general conviction, but as
 15332	it was, the disorder was readily and naturally attributed to the stupid
 15333	Germans, and everyone was convinced that a dangerous muddle had been
 15334	occasioned by the sausage eaters.
 15335	
 15336	âWhy have we stopped? Is the way blocked? Or have we already come up
 15337	against the French?â
 15338	
 15339	âNo, one canât hear them. Theyâd be firing if we had.â
 15340	
 15341	âThey were in a hurry enough to start us, and now here we stand in
 15342	the middle of a field without rhyme or reason. Itâs all those damned
 15343	Germansâ muddling! What stupid devils!â
 15344	
 15345	âYes, Iâd send them on in front, but no fear, theyâre crowding up
 15346	behind. And now here we stand hungry.â
 15347	
 15348	âI say, shall we soon be clear? They say the cavalry are blocking the
 15349	way,â said an officer.
 15350	
 15351	âAh, those damned Germans! They donât know their own country!â
 15352	said another.
 15353	
 15354	âWhat division are you?â shouted an adjutant, riding up.
 15355	
 15356	âThe Eighteenth.â
 15357	
 15358	âThen why are you here? You should have gone on long ago, now you
 15359	wonât get there till evening.â
 15360	
 15361	âWhat stupid orders! They donât themselves know what they are
 15362	doing!â said the officer and rode off.
 15363	
 15364	Then a general rode past shouting something angrily, not in Russian.
 15365	
 15366	âTafa-lafa! But what heâs jabbering no one can make out,â said a
 15367	soldier, mimicking the general who had ridden away. âIâd shoot them,
 15368	the scoundrels!â
 15369	
 15370	âWe were ordered to be at the place before nine, but we havenât got
 15371	halfway. Fine orders!â was being repeated on different sides.
 15372	
 15373	And the feeling of energy with which the troops had started began to
 15374	turn into vexation and anger at the stupid arrangements and at the
 15375	Germans.
 15376	
 15377	The cause of the confusion was that while the Austrian cavalry was
 15378	moving toward our left flank, the higher command found that our center
 15379	was too far separated from our right flank and the cavalry were all
 15380	ordered to turn back to the right. Several thousand cavalry crossed in
 15381	front of the infantry, who had to wait.
 15382	
 15383	At the front an altercation occurred between an Austrian guide and a
 15384	Russian general. The general shouted a demand that the cavalry should be
 15385	halted, the Austrian argued that not he, but the higher command, was to
 15386	blame. The troops meanwhile stood growing listless and dispirited. After
 15387	an hourâs delay they at last moved on, descending the hill. The fog
 15388	that was dispersing on the hill lay still more densely below, where they
 15389	were descending. In front in the fog a shot was heard and then another,
 15390	at first irregularly at varying intervalsâtrata...tatâand then more
 15391	and more regularly and rapidly, and the action at the Goldbach Stream
 15392	began.
 15393	
 15394	Not expecting to come on the enemy down by the stream, and having
 15395	stumbled on him in the fog, hearing no encouraging word from their
 15396	commanders, and with a consciousness of being too late spreading through
 15397	the ranks, and above all being unable to see anything in front or around
 15398	them in the thick fog, the Russians exchanged shots with the enemy
 15399	lazily and advanced and again halted, receiving no timely orders from
 15400	the officers or adjutants who wandered about in the fog in those unknown
 15401	surroundings unable to find their own regiments. In this way the action
 15402	began for the first, second, and third columns, which had gone down into
 15403	the valley. The fourth column, with which KutÃºzov was, stood on the
 15404	Pratzen Heights.
 15405	
 15406	Below, where the fight was beginning, there was still thick fog; on the
 15407	higher ground it was clearing, but nothing could be seen of what was
 15408	going on in front. Whether all the enemy forces were, as we supposed,
 15409	six miles away, or whether they were near by in that sea of mist, no one
 15410	knew till after eight oâclock.
 15411	
 15412	It was nine oâclock in the morning. The fog lay unbroken like a sea
 15413	down below, but higher up at the village of Schlappanitz where Napoleon
 15414	stood with his marshals around him, it was quite light. Above him was
 15415	a clear blue sky, and the sunâs vast orb quivered like a huge hollow,
 15416	crimson float on the surface of that milky sea of mist. The whole French
 15417	army, and even Napoleon himself with his staff, were not on the far side
 15418	of the streams and hollows of Sokolnitz and Schlappanitz beyond which we
 15419	intended to take up our position and begin the action, but were on this
 15420	side, so close to our own forces that Napoleon with the naked eye could
 15421	distinguish a mounted man from one on foot. Napoleon, in the blue cloak
 15422	which he had worn on his Italian campaign, sat on his small gray Arab
 15423	horse a little in front of his marshals. He gazed silently at the hills
 15424	which seemed to rise out of the sea of mist and on which the Russian
 15425	troops were moving in the distance, and he listened to the sounds of
 15426	firing in the valley. Not a single muscle of his faceâwhich in those
 15427	days was still thinâmoved. His gleaming eyes were fixed intently on
 15428	one spot. His predictions were being justified. Part of the Russian
 15429	force had already descended into the valley toward the ponds and lakes
 15430	and part were leaving these Pratzen Heights which he intended to attack
 15431	and regarded as the key to the position. He saw over the mist that in
 15432	a hollow between two hills near the village of Pratzen, the Russian
 15433	columns, their bayonets glittering, were moving continuously in one
 15434	direction toward the valley and disappearing one after another into
 15435	the mist. From information he had received the evening before, from the
 15436	sound of wheels and footsteps heard by the outposts during the night,
 15437	by the disorderly movement of the Russian columns, and from all
 15438	indications, he saw clearly that the allies believed him to be far away
 15439	in front of them, and that the columns moving near Pratzen constituted
 15440	the center of the Russian army, and that that center was already
 15441	sufficiently weakened to be successfully attacked. But still he did not
 15442	begin the engagement.
 15443	
 15444	Today was a great day for himâthe anniversary of his coronation.
 15445	Before dawn he had slept for a few hours, and refreshed, vigorous, and
 15446	in good spirits, he mounted his horse and rode out into the field
 15447	in that happy mood in which everything seems possible and everything
 15448	succeeds. He sat motionless, looking at the heights visible above
 15449	the mist, and his cold face wore that special look of confident,
 15450	self-complacent happiness that one sees on the face of a boy happily
 15451	in love. The marshals stood behind him not venturing to distract his
 15452	attention. He looked now at the Pratzen Heights, now at the sun floating
 15453	up out of the mist.
 15454	
 15455	When the sun had entirely emerged from the fog, and fields and mist were
 15456	aglow with dazzling lightâas if he had only awaited this to begin the
 15457	actionâhe drew the glove from his shapely white hand, made a sign
 15458	with it to the marshals, and ordered the action to begin. The marshals,
 15459	accompanied by adjutants, galloped off in different directions, and
 15460	a few minutes later the chief forces of the French army moved rapidly
 15461	toward those Pratzen Heights which were being more and more denuded by
 15462	Russian troops moving down the valley to their left.
 15463	
 15464	
 15465	
 15466	
 15467	
 15468	CHAPTER XV
 15469	
 15470	At eight oâclock KutÃºzov rode to Pratzen at the head of the fourth
 15471	column, MilorÃ¡dovichâs, the one that was to take the place of
 15472	PrzebyszÃ©wskiâs and Langeronâs columns which had already gone down
 15473	into the valley. He greeted the men of the foremost regiment and gave
 15474	them the order to march, thereby indicating that he intended to lead
 15475	that column himself. When he had reached the village of Pratzen he
 15476	halted. Prince Andrew was behind, among the immense number forming the
 15477	commander in chiefâs suite. He was in a state of suppressed excitement
 15478	and irritation, though controlledly calm as a man is at the approach of
 15479	a long-awaited moment. He was firmly convinced that this was the day of
 15480	his Toulon, or his bridge of Arcola. How it would come about he did not
 15481	know, but he felt sure it would do so. The locality and the position of
 15482	our troops were known to him as far as they could be known to anyone
 15483	in our army. His own strategic plan, which obviously could not now
 15484	be carried out, was forgotten. Now, entering into Weyrotherâs plan,
 15485	Prince Andrew considered possible contingencies and formed new projects
 15486	such as might call for his rapidity of perception and decision.
 15487	
 15488	To the left down below in the mist, the musketry fire of unseen forces
 15489	could be heard. It was there Prince Andrew thought the fight would
 15490	concentrate. âThere we shall encounter difficulties, and there,â
 15491	thought he, âI shall be sent with a brigade or division, and there,
 15492	standard in hand, I shall go forward and break whatever is in front of
 15493	me.â
 15494	
 15495	He could not look calmly at the standards of the passing battalions.
 15496	Seeing them he kept thinking, âThat may be the very standard with
 15497	which I shall lead the army.â
 15498	
 15499	In the morning all that was left of the night mist on the heights was
 15500	a hoar frost now turning to dew, but in the valleys it still lay like a
 15501	milk-white sea. Nothing was visible in the valley to the left into which
 15502	our troops had descended and from whence came the sounds of firing.
 15503	Above the heights was the dark clear sky, and to the right the vast orb
 15504	of the sun. In front, far off on the farther shore of that sea of mist,
 15505	some wooded hills were discernible, and it was there the enemy probably
 15506	was, for something could be descried. On the right the Guards were
 15507	entering the misty region with a sound of hoofs and wheels and now and
 15508	then a gleam of bayonets; to the left beyond the village similar masses
 15509	of cavalry came up and disappeared in the sea of mist. In front and
 15510	behind moved infantry. The commander in chief was standing at the end of
 15511	the village letting the troops pass by him. That morning KutÃºzov seemed
 15512	worn and irritable. The infantry passing before him came to a halt
 15513	without any command being given, apparently obstructed by something in
 15514	front.
 15515	
 15516	âDo order them to form into battalion columns and go round the
 15517	village!â he said angrily to a general who had ridden up. âDonât
 15518	you understand, your excellency, my dear sir, that you must not
 15519	defile through narrow village streets when we are marching against the
 15520	enemy?â
 15521	
 15522	âI intended to re-form them beyond the village, your excellency,â
 15523	answered the general.
 15524	
 15525	KutÃºzov laughed bitterly.
 15526	
 15527	âYouâll make a fine thing of it, deploying in sight of the enemy!
 15528	Very fine!â
 15529	
 15530	âThe enemy is still far away, your excellency. According to the
 15531	dispositions...â
 15532	
 15533	âThe dispositions!â exclaimed KutÃºzov bitterly. âWho told you
 15534	that?... Kindly do as you are ordered.â
 15535	
 15536	âYes, sir.â
 15537	
 15538	âMy dear fellow,â NesvÃ­tski whispered to Prince Andrew, âthe old
 15539	man is as surly as a dog.â
 15540	
 15541	An Austrian officer in a white uniform with green plumes in his hat
 15542	galloped up to KutÃºzov and asked in the Emperorâs name had the fourth
 15543	column advanced into action.
 15544	
 15545	KutÃºzov turned round without answering and his eye happened to fall
 15546	upon Prince Andrew, who was beside him. Seeing him, KutÃºzovâs
 15547	malevolent and caustic expression softened, as if admitting that what
 15548	was being done was not his adjutantâs fault, and still not answering
 15549	the Austrian adjutant, he addressed BolkÃ³nski.
 15550	
 15551	âGo, my dear fellow, and see whether the third division has passed the
 15552	village. Tell it to stop and await my orders.â
 15553	
 15554	Hardly had Prince Andrew started than he stopped him.
 15555	
 15556	âAnd ask whether sharpshooters have been posted,â he added. âWhat
 15557	are they doing? What are they doing?â he murmured to himself, still
 15558	not replying to the Austrian.
 15559	
 15560	Prince Andrew galloped off to execute the order.
 15561	
 15562	Overtaking the battalions that continued to advance, he stopped
 15563	the third division and convinced himself that there really were no
 15564	sharpshooters in front of our columns. The colonel at the head of the
 15565	regiment was much surprised at the commander in chiefâs order to throw
 15566	out skirmishers. He had felt perfectly sure that there were other troops
 15567	in front of him and that the enemy must be at least six miles away.
 15568	There was really nothing to be seen in front except a barren descent
 15569	hidden by dense mist. Having given orders in the commander in chiefâs
 15570	name to rectify this omission, Prince Andrew galloped back. KutÃºzov
 15571	still in the same place, his stout body resting heavily in the saddle
 15572	with the lassitude of age, sat yawning wearily with closed eyes. The
 15573	troops were no longer moving, but stood with the butts of their muskets
 15574	on the ground.
 15575	
 15576	âAll right, all right!â he said to Prince Andrew, and turned to a
 15577	general who, watch in hand, was saying it was time they started as all
 15578	the left-flank columns had already descended.
 15579	
 15580	âPlenty of time, your excellency,â muttered KutÃºzov in the midst of
 15581	a yawn. âPlenty of time,â he repeated.
 15582	
 15583	Just then at a distance behind KutÃºzov was heard the sound of regiments
 15584	saluting, and this sound rapidly came nearer along the whole extended
 15585	line of the advancing Russian columns. Evidently the person they were
 15586	greeting was riding quickly. When the soldiers of the regiment in front
 15587	of which KutÃºzov was standing began to shout, he rode a little to one
 15588	side and looked round with a frown. Along the road from Pratzen galloped
 15589	what looked like a squadron of horsemen in various uniforms. Two of them
 15590	rode side by side in front, at full gallop. One in a black uniform with
 15591	white plumes in his hat rode a bobtailed chestnut horse, the other who
 15592	was in a white uniform rode a black one. These were the two Emperors
 15593	followed by their suites. KutÃºzov, affecting the manners of an old
 15594	soldier at the front, gave the command âAttention!â and rode up
 15595	to the Emperors with a salute. His whole appearance and manner were
 15596	suddenly transformed. He put on the air of a subordinate who obeys
 15597	without reasoning. With an affectation of respect which evidently struck
 15598	Alexander unpleasantly, he rode up and saluted.
 15599	
 15600	This unpleasant impression merely flitted over the young and happy face
 15601	of the Emperor like a cloud of haze across a clear sky and vanished.
 15602	After his illness he looked rather thinner that day than on the field
 15603	of OlmÃ¼tz where BolkÃ³nski had seen him for the first time abroad, but
 15604	there was still the same bewitching combination of majesty and mildness
 15605	in his fine gray eyes, and on his delicate lips the same capacity for
 15606	varying expression and the same prevalent appearance of goodhearted
 15607	innocent youth.
 15608	
 15609	At the OlmÃ¼tz review he had seemed more majestic; here he seemed
 15610	brighter and more energetic. He was slightly flushed after galloping two
 15611	miles, and reining in his horse he sighed restfully and looked round
 15612	at the faces of his suite, young and animated as his own. CzartorÃ½ski,
 15613	NovosÃ­ltsev, Prince VolkÃ³nsky, StrÃ³gonov, and the others, all richly
 15614	dressed gay young men on splendid, well-groomed, fresh, only slightly
 15615	heated horses, exchanging remarks and smiling, had stopped behind the
 15616	Emperor. The Emperor Francis, a rosy, long faced young man, sat very
 15617	erect on his handsome black horse, looking about him in a leisurely and
 15618	preoccupied manner. He beckoned to one of his white adjutants and asked
 15619	some questionââMost likely he is asking at what oâclock they
 15620	started,â thought Prince Andrew, watching his old acquaintance with
 15621	a smile he could not repress as he recalled his reception at BrÃ¼nn.
 15622	In the Emperorsâ suite were the picked young orderly officers of the
 15623	Guard and line regiments, Russian and Austrian. Among them were grooms
 15624	leading the Tsarâs beautiful relay horses covered with embroidered
 15625	cloths.
 15626	
 15627	As when a window is opened a whiff of fresh air from the fields enters
 15628	a stuffy room, so a whiff of youthfulness, energy, and confidence of
 15629	success reached KutÃºzovâs cheerless staff with the galloping advent
 15630	of all these brilliant young men.
 15631	
 15632	âWhy arenât you beginning, Michael IlariÃ³novich?â said the
 15633	Emperor Alexander hurriedly to KutÃºzov, glancing courteously at the
 15634	same time at the Emperor Francis.
 15635	
 15636	âI am waiting, Your Majesty,â answered KutÃºzov, bending forward
 15637	respectfully.
 15638	
 15639	The Emperor, frowning slightly, bent his ear forward as if he had not
 15640	quite heard.
 15641	
 15642	âWaiting, Your Majesty,â repeated KutÃºzov. (Prince Andrew noted
 15643	that KutÃºzovâs upper lip twitched unnaturally as he said the
 15644	word âwaiting.â) âNot all the columns have formed up yet, Your
 15645	Majesty.â
 15646	
 15647	The Tsar heard but obviously did not like the reply; he shrugged his
 15648	rather round shoulders and glanced at NovosÃ­ltsev who was near him, as
 15649	if complaining of KutÃºzov.
 15650	
 15651	âYou know, Michael IlariÃ³novich, we are not on the Empressâ Field
 15652	where a parade does not begin till all the troops are assembled,â said
 15653	the Tsar with another glance at the Emperor Francis, as if inviting
 15654	him if not to join in at least to listen to what he was saying. But the
 15655	Emperor Francis continued to look about him and did not listen.
 15656	
 15657	âThat is just why I do not begin, sire,â said KutÃºzov in a
 15658	resounding voice, apparently to preclude the possibility of not being
 15659	heard, and again something in his face twitchedââThat is just why
 15660	I do not begin, sire, because we are not on parade and not on the
 15661	Empressâ Field,â said he clearly and distinctly.
 15662	
 15663	In the Emperorâs suite all exchanged rapid looks that expressed
 15664	dissatisfaction and reproach. âOld though he may be, he should not, he
 15665	certainly should not, speak like that,â their glances seemed to say.
 15666	
 15667	The Tsar looked intently and observantly into KutÃºzovâs eye
 15668	waiting to hear whether he would say anything more. But KutÃºzov, with
 15669	respectfully bowed head, seemed also to be waiting. The silence lasted
 15670	for about a minute.
 15671	
 15672	âHowever, if you command it, Your Majesty,â said KutÃºzov, lifting
 15673	his head and again assuming his former tone of a dull, unreasoning, but
 15674	submissive general.
 15675	
 15676	He touched his horse and having called MilorÃ¡dovich, the commander of
 15677	the column, gave him the order to advance.
 15678	
 15679	The troops again began to move, and two battalions of the NÃ³vgorod and
 15680	one of the Ãpsheron regiment went forward past the Emperor.
 15681	
 15682	As this Ãpsheron battalion marched by, the red-faced MilorÃ¡dovich,
 15683	without his greatcoat, with his Orders on his breast and an enormous
 15684	tuft of plumes in his cocked hat worn on one side with its corners front
 15685	and back, galloped strenuously forward, and with a dashing salute reined
 15686	in his horse before the Emperor.
 15687	
 15688	âGod be with you, general!â said the Emperor.
 15689	
 15690	âMa foi, sire, nous ferons ce qui sera dans notre possibilitÃ©,
 15691	sire,â * he answered gaily, raising nevertheless ironic smiles among
 15692	the gentlemen of the Tsarâs suite by his poor French.
 15693	
 15694	     * âIndeed, Sire, we shall do everything it is possible to
 15695	     do, Sire.â
 15696	
 15697	
 15698	MilorÃ¡dovich wheeled his horse sharply and stationed himself a little
 15699	behind the Emperor. The Ãpsheron men, excited by the Tsarâs presence,
 15700	passed in step before the Emperors and their suites at a bold, brisk
 15701	pace.
 15702	
 15703	âLads!â shouted MilorÃ¡dovich in a loud, self-confident, and cheery
 15704	voice, obviously so elated by the sound of firing, by the prospect of
 15705	battle, and by the sight of the gallant Ãpsherons, his comrades in
 15706	SuvÃ³rovâs time, now passing so gallantly before the Emperors, that he
 15707	forgot the sovereignsâ presence. âLads, itâs not the first village
 15708	youâve had to take,â cried he.
 15709	
 15710	âGlad to do our best!â shouted the soldiers.
 15711	
 15712	The Emperorâs horse started at the sudden cry. This horse that had
 15713	carried the sovereign at reviews in Russia bore him also here on the
 15714	field of Austerlitz, enduring the heedless blows of his left foot and
 15715	pricking its ears at the sound of shots just as it had done on the
 15716	Empressâ Field, not understanding the significance of the firing, nor
 15717	of the nearness of the Emperor Francisâ black cob, nor of all that was
 15718	being said, thought, and felt that day by its rider.
 15719	
 15720	The Emperor turned with a smile to one of his followers and made a
 15721	remark to him, pointing to the gallant Ãpsherons.
 15722	
 15723	
 15724	
 15725	
 15726	
 15727	CHAPTER XVI
 15728	
 15729	KutÃºzov accompanied by his adjutants rode at a walking pace behind the
 15730	carabineers.
 15731	
 15732	When he had gone less than half a mile in the rear of the column he
 15733	stopped at a solitary, deserted house that had probably once been an
 15734	inn, where two roads parted. Both of them led downhill and troops were
 15735	marching along both.
 15736	
 15737	The fog had begun to clear and enemy troops were already dimly visible
 15738	about a mile and a half off on the opposite heights. Down below, on
 15739	the left, the firing became more distinct. KutÃºzov had stopped and was
 15740	speaking to an Austrian general. Prince Andrew, who was a little behind
 15741	looking at them, turned to an adjutant to ask him for a field glass.
 15742	
 15743	âLook, look!â said this adjutant, looking not at the troops in the
 15744	distance, but down the hill before him. âItâs the French!â
 15745	
 15746	The two generals and the adjutant took hold of the field glass, trying
 15747	to snatch it from one another. The expression on all their faces
 15748	suddenly changed to one of horror. The French were supposed to be a
 15749	mile and a half away, but had suddenly and unexpectedly appeared just in
 15750	front of us.
 15751	
 15752	âItâs the enemy?... No!... Yes, see it is!... for certain.... But
 15753	how is that?â said different voices.
 15754	
 15755	With the naked eye Prince Andrew saw below them to the right, not more
 15756	than five hundred paces from where KutÃºzov was standing, a dense French
 15757	column coming up to meet the Ãpsherons.
 15758	
 15759	âHere it is! The decisive moment has arrived. My turn has come,â
 15760	thought Prince Andrew, and striking his horse he rode up to KutÃºzov.
 15761	
 15762	âThe Ãpsherons must be stopped, your excellency,â cried he. But at
 15763	that very instant a cloud of smoke spread all round, firing was heard
 15764	quite close at hand, and a voice of naÃ¯ve terror barely two steps from
 15765	Prince Andrew shouted, âBrothers! Allâs lost!â And at this as if
 15766	at a command, everyone began to run.
 15767	
 15768	Confused and ever-increasing crowds were running back to where five
 15769	minutes before the troops had passed the Emperors. Not only would it
 15770	have been difficult to stop that crowd, it was even impossible not to
 15771	be carried back with it oneself. BolkÃ³nski only tried not to lose
 15772	touch with it, and looked around bewildered and unable to grasp what was
 15773	happening in front of him. NesvÃ­tski with an angry face, red and unlike
 15774	himself, was shouting to KutÃºzov that if he did not ride away at once
 15775	he would certainly be taken prisoner. KutÃºzov remained in the same
 15776	place and without answering drew out a handkerchief. Blood was flowing
 15777	from his cheek. Prince Andrew forced his way to him.
 15778	
 15779	âYou are wounded?â he asked, hardly able to master the trembling of
 15780	his lower jaw.
 15781	
 15782	âThe wound is not here, it is there!â said KutÃºzov, pressing the
 15783	handkerchief to his wounded cheek and pointing to the fleeing soldiers.
 15784	âStop them!â he shouted, and at the same moment, probably realizing
 15785	that it was impossible to stop them, spurred his horse and rode to the
 15786	right.
 15787	
 15788	A fresh wave of the flying mob caught him and bore him back with it.
 15789	
 15790	The troops were running in such a dense mass that once surrounded by
 15791	them it was difficult to get out again. One was shouting, âGet on!
 15792	Why are you hindering us?â Another in the same place turned round and
 15793	fired in the air; a third was striking the horse KutÃºzov himself rode.
 15794	Having by a great effort got away to the left from that flood of men,
 15795	KutÃºzov, with his suite diminished by more than half, rode toward a
 15796	sound of artillery fire near by. Having forced his way out of the crowd
 15797	of fugitives, Prince Andrew, trying to keep near KutÃºzov, saw on the
 15798	slope of the hill amid the smoke a Russian battery that was still firing
 15799	and Frenchmen running toward it. Higher up stood some Russian infantry,
 15800	neither moving forward to protect the battery nor backward with the
 15801	fleeing crowd. A mounted general separated himself from the infantry and
 15802	approached KutÃºzov. Of KutÃºzovâs suite only four remained. They were
 15803	all pale and exchanged looks in silence.
 15804	
 15805	âStop those wretches!â gasped KutÃºzov to the regimental commander,
 15806	pointing to the flying soldiers; but at that instant, as if to punish
 15807	him for those words, bullets flew hissing across the regiment and across
 15808	KutÃºzovâs suite like a flock of little birds.
 15809	
 15810	The French had attacked the battery and, seeing KutÃºzov, were firing
 15811	at him. After this volley the regimental commander clutched at his leg;
 15812	several soldiers fell, and a second lieutenant who was holding the
 15813	flag let it fall from his hands. It swayed and fell, but caught on the
 15814	muskets of the nearest soldiers. The soldiers started firing without
 15815	orders.
 15816	
 15817	âOh! Oh! Oh!â groaned KutÃºzov despairingly and looked around....
 15818	âBolkÃ³nski!â he whispered, his voice trembling from a consciousness
 15819	of the feebleness of age, âBolkÃ³nski!â he whispered, pointing to
 15820	the disordered battalion and at the enemy, âwhatâs that?â
 15821	
 15822	But before he had finished speaking, Prince Andrew, feeling tears of
 15823	shame and anger choking him, had already leapt from his horse and run to
 15824	the standard.
 15825	
 15826	âForward, lads!â he shouted in a voice piercing as a childâs.
 15827	
 15828	âHere it is!â thought he, seizing the staff of the standard and
 15829	hearing with pleasure the whistle of bullets evidently aimed at him.
 15830	Several soldiers fell.
 15831	
 15832	âHurrah!â shouted Prince Andrew, and, scarcely able to hold up
 15833	the heavy standard, he ran forward with full confidence that the whole
 15834	battalion would follow him.
 15835	
 15836	And really he only ran a few steps alone. One soldier moved and then
 15837	another and soon the whole battalion ran forward shouting âHurrah!â
 15838	and overtook him. A sergeant of the battalion ran up and took the flag
 15839	that was swaying from its weight in Prince Andrewâs hands, but he
 15840	was immediately killed. Prince Andrew again seized the standard and,
 15841	dragging it by the staff, ran on with the battalion. In front he saw our
 15842	artillerymen, some of whom were fighting, while others, having abandoned
 15843	their guns, were running toward him. He also saw French infantry
 15844	soldiers who were seizing the artillery horses and turning the guns
 15845	round. Prince Andrew and the battalion were already within twenty paces
 15846	of the cannon. He heard the whistle of bullets above him unceasingly and
 15847	to right and left of him soldiers continually groaned and dropped. But
 15848	he did not look at them: he looked only at what was going on in front
 15849	of himâat the battery. He now saw clearly the figure of a red-haired
 15850	gunner with his shako knocked awry, pulling one end of a mop while
 15851	a French soldier tugged at the other. He could distinctly see the
 15852	distraught yet angry expression on the faces of these two men, who
 15853	evidently did not realize what they were doing.
 15854	
 15855	âWhat are they about?â thought Prince Andrew as he gazed at them.
 15856	âWhy doesnât the red-haired gunner run away as he is unarmed?
 15857	Why doesnât the Frenchman stab him? He will not get away before the
 15858	Frenchman remembers his bayonet and stabs him....â
 15859	
 15860	And really another French soldier, trailing his musket, ran up to
 15861	the struggling men, and the fate of the red-haired gunner, who had
 15862	triumphantly secured the mop and still did not realize what awaited him,
 15863	was about to be decided. But Prince Andrew did not see how it ended. It
 15864	seemed to him as though one of the soldiers near him hit him on the head
 15865	with the full swing of a bludgeon. It hurt a little, but the worst of
 15866	it was that the pain distracted him and prevented his seeing what he had
 15867	been looking at.
 15868	
 15869	âWhatâs this? Am I falling? My legs are giving way,â thought he,
 15870	and fell on his back. He opened his eyes, hoping to see how the struggle
 15871	of the Frenchmen with the gunners ended, whether the red-haired gunner
 15872	had been killed or not and whether the cannon had been captured or
 15873	saved. But he saw nothing. Above him there was now nothing but the
 15874	skyâthe lofty sky, not clear yet still immeasurably lofty, with gray
 15875	clouds gliding slowly across it. âHow quiet, peaceful, and solemn; not
 15876	at all as I ran,â thought Prince Andrewâânot as we ran, shouting
 15877	and fighting, not at all as the gunner and the Frenchman with frightened
 15878	and angry faces struggled for the mop: how differently do those clouds
 15879	glide across that lofty infinite sky! How was it I did not see that
 15880	lofty sky before? And how happy I am to have found it at last! Yes! All
 15881	is vanity, all falsehood, except that infinite sky. There is nothing,
 15882	nothing, but that. But even it does not exist, there is nothing but
 15883	quiet and peace. Thank God!...â
 15884	
 15885	
 15886	
 15887	
 15888	
 15889	CHAPTER XVII
 15890	
 15891	On our right flank commanded by BagratiÃ³n, at nine oâclock the battle
 15892	had not yet begun. Not wishing to agree to DolgorÃºkovâs demand to
 15893	commence the action, and wishing to avert responsibility from himself,
 15894	Prince BagratiÃ³n proposed to DolgorÃºkov to send to inquire of the
 15895	commander in chief. BagratiÃ³n knew that as the distance between the two
 15896	flanks was more than six miles, even if the messenger were not killed
 15897	(which he very likely would be), and found the commander in chief
 15898	(which would be very difficult), he would not be able to get back before
 15899	evening.
 15900	
 15901	BagratiÃ³n cast his large, expressionless, sleepy eyes round his suite,
 15902	and the boyish face RostÃ³v, breathless with excitement and hope, was
 15903	the first to catch his eye. He sent him.
 15904	
 15905	âAnd if I should meet His Majesty before I meet the commander in
 15906	chief, your excellency?â said RostÃ³v, with his hand to his cap.
 15907	
 15908	âYou can give the message to His Majesty,â said DolgorÃºkov,
 15909	hurriedly interrupting BagratiÃ³n.
 15910	
 15911	On being relieved from picket duty RostÃ³v had managed to get a few
 15912	hoursâ sleep before morning and felt cheerful, bold, and resolute,
 15913	with elasticity of movement, faith in his good fortune, and generally in
 15914	that state of mind which makes everything seem possible, pleasant, and
 15915	easy.
 15916	
 15917	All his wishes were being fulfilled that morning: there was to be a
 15918	general engagement in which he was taking part, more than that, he was
 15919	orderly to the bravest general, and still more, he was going with a
 15920	message to KutÃºzov, perhaps even to the sovereign himself. The morning
 15921	was bright, he had a good horse under him, and his heart was full of
 15922	joy and happiness. On receiving the order he gave his horse the rein
 15923	and galloped along the line. At first he rode along the line of
 15924	BagratiÃ³nâs troops, which had not yet advanced into action but were
 15925	standing motionless; then he came to the region occupied by UvÃ¡rovâs
 15926	cavalry and here he noticed a stir and signs of preparation for battle;
 15927	having passed UvÃ¡rovâs cavalry he clearly heard the sound of cannon
 15928	and musketry ahead of him. The firing grew louder and louder.
 15929	
 15930	In the fresh morning air were now heard, not two or three musket shots
 15931	at irregular intervals as before, followed by one or two cannon shots,
 15932	but a roll of volleys of musketry from the slopes of the hill before
 15933	Pratzen, interrupted by such frequent reports of cannon that sometimes
 15934	several of them were not separated from one another but merged into a
 15935	general roar.
 15936	
 15937	He could see puffs of musketry smoke that seemed to chase one another
 15938	down the hillsides, and clouds of cannon smoke rolling, spreading,
 15939	and mingling with one another. He could also, by the gleam of bayonets
 15940	visible through the smoke, make out moving masses of infantry and narrow
 15941	lines of artillery with green caissons.
 15942	
 15943	RostÃ³v stopped his horse for a moment on a hillock to see what was
 15944	going on, but strain his attention as he would he could not understand
 15945	or make out anything of what was happening: there in the smoke men of
 15946	some sort were moving about, in front and behind moved lines of troops;
 15947	but why, whither, and who they were, it was impossible to make out.
 15948	These sights and sounds had no depressing or intimidating effect on him;
 15949	on the contrary, they stimulated his energy and determination.
 15950	
 15951	âGo on! Go on! Give it them!â he mentally exclaimed at these sounds,
 15952	and again proceeded to gallop along the line, penetrating farther and
 15953	farther into the region where the army was already in action.
 15954	
 15955	âHow it will be there I donât know, but all will be well!â thought
 15956	RostÃ³v.
 15957	
 15958	After passing some Austrian troops he noticed that the next part of the
 15959	line (the Guards) was already in action.
 15960	
 15961	âSo much the better! I shall see it close,â he thought.
 15962	
 15963	He was riding almost along the front line. A handful of men came
 15964	galloping toward him. They were our Uhlans who with disordered
 15965	ranks were returning from the attack. RostÃ³v got out of their way,
 15966	involuntarily noticed that one of them was bleeding, and galloped on.
 15967	
 15968	âThat is no business of mine,â he thought. He had not ridden many
 15969	hundred yards after that before he saw to his left, across the whole
 15970	width of the field, an enormous mass of cavalry in brilliant white
 15971	uniforms, mounted on black horses, trotting straight toward him and
 15972	across his path. RostÃ³v put his horse to full gallop to get out of the
 15973	way of these men, and he would have got clear had they continued at the
 15974	same speed, but they kept increasing their pace, so that some of the
 15975	horses were already galloping. RostÃ³v heard the thud of their hoofs
 15976	and the jingle of their weapons and saw their horses, their figures, and
 15977	even their faces, more and more distinctly. They were our Horse Guards,
 15978	advancing to attack the French cavalry that was coming to meet them.
 15979	
 15980	The Horse Guards were galloping, but still holding in their horses.
 15981	RostÃ³v could already see their faces and heard the command:
 15982	âCharge!â shouted by an officer who was urging his thoroughbred to
 15983	full speed. RostÃ³v, fearing to be crushed or swept into the attack on
 15984	the French, galloped along the front as hard as his horse could go, but
 15985	still was not in time to avoid them.
 15986	
 15987	The last of the Horse Guards, a huge pockmarked fellow, frowned angrily
 15988	on seeing RostÃ³v before him, with whom he would inevitably collide.
 15989	This Guardsman would certainly have bowled RostÃ³v and his Bedouin over
 15990	(RostÃ³v felt himself quite tiny and weak compared to these gigantic men
 15991	and horses) had it not occurred to RostÃ³v to flourish his whip before
 15992	the eyes of the Guardsmanâs horse. The heavy black horse, sixteen
 15993	hands high, shied, throwing back its ears; but the pockmarked Guardsman
 15994	drove his huge spurs in violently, and the horse, flourishing its tail
 15995	and extending its neck, galloped on yet faster. Hardly had the Horse
 15996	Guards passed RostÃ³v before he heard them shout, âHurrah!â and
 15997	looking back saw that their foremost ranks were mixed up with some
 15998	foreign cavalry with red epaulets, probably French. He could see nothing
 15999	more, for immediately afterwards cannon began firing from somewhere and
 16000	smoke enveloped everything.
 16001	
 16002	At that moment, as the Horse Guards, having passed him, disappeared in
 16003	the smoke, RostÃ³v hesitated whether to gallop after them or to go where
 16004	he was sent. This was the brilliant charge of the Horse Guards that
 16005	amazed the French themselves. RostÃ³v was horrified to hear later that
 16006	of all that mass of huge and handsome men, of all those brilliant,
 16007	rich youths, officers and cadets, who had galloped past him on their
 16008	thousand-ruble horses, only eighteen were left after the charge.
 16009	
 16010	âWhy should I envy them? My chance is not lost, and maybe I shall see
 16011	the Emperor immediately!â thought RostÃ³v and galloped on.
 16012	
 16013	When he came level with the Foot Guards he noticed that about them and
 16014	around them cannon balls were flying, of which he was aware not so
 16015	much because he heard their sound as because he saw uneasiness on
 16016	the soldiersâ faces and unnatural warlike solemnity on those of the
 16017	officers.
 16018	
 16019	Passing behind one of the lines of a regiment of Foot Guards he heard a
 16020	voice calling him by name.
 16021	
 16022	âRostÃ³v!â
 16023	
 16024	âWhat?â he answered, not recognizing BorÃ­s.
 16025	
 16026	âI say, weâve been in the front line! Our regiment attacked!â said
 16027	BorÃ­s with the happy smile seen on the faces of young men who have been
 16028	under fire for the first time.
 16029	
 16030	RostÃ³v stopped.
 16031	
 16032	âHave you?â he said. âWell, how did it go?â
 16033	
 16034	âWe drove them back!â said BorÃ­s with animation, growing talkative.
 16035	âCan you imagine it?â and he began describing how the Guards, having
 16036	taken up their position and seeing troops before them, thought they were
 16037	Austrians, and all at once discovered from the cannon balls discharged
 16038	by those troops that they were themselves in the front line and had
 16039	unexpectedly to go into action. RostÃ³v without hearing BorÃ­s to the
 16040	end spurred his horse.
 16041	
 16042	âWhere are you off to?â asked BorÃ­s.
 16043	
 16044	âWith a message to His Majesty.â
 16045	
 16046	âThere he is!â said BorÃ­s, thinking RostÃ³v had said âHis
 16047	Highness,â and pointing to the Grand Duke who with his high shoulders
 16048	and frowning brows stood a hundred paces away from them in his helmet
 16049	and Horse Guardsâ jacket, shouting something to a pale, white
 16050	uniformed Austrian officer.
 16051	
 16052	âBut thatâs the Grand Duke, and I want the commander in chief or the
 16053	Emperor,â said RostÃ³v, and was about to spur his horse.
 16054	
 16055	âCount! Count!â shouted Berg who ran up from the other side as eager
 16056	as BorÃ­s. âCount! I am wounded in my right handâ (and he showed his
 16057	bleeding hand with a handkerchief tied round it) âand I remained at
 16058	the front. I held my sword in my left hand, Count. All our familyâthe
 16059	von Bergsâhave been knights!â
 16060	
 16061	He said something more, but RostÃ³v did not wait to hear it and rode
 16062	away.
 16063	
 16064	Having passed the Guards and traversed an empty space, RostÃ³v, to avoid
 16065	again getting in front of the first line as he had done when the Horse
 16066	Guards charged, followed the line of reserves, going far round the place
 16067	where the hottest musket fire and cannonade were heard. Suddenly he
 16068	heard musket fire quite close in front of him and behind our troops,
 16069	where he could never have expected the enemy to be.
 16070	
 16071	âWhat can it be?â he thought. âThe enemy in the rear of our army?
 16072	Impossible!â And suddenly he was seized by a panic of fear for himself
 16073	and for the issue of the whole battle. âBut be that what it may,â
 16074	he reflected, âthere is no riding round it now. I must look for the
 16075	commander in chief here, and if all is lost it is for me to perish with
 16076	the rest.â
 16077	
 16078	The foreboding of evil that had suddenly come over RostÃ³v was more and
 16079	more confirmed the farther he rode into the region behind the village of
 16080	Pratzen, which was full of troops of all kinds.
 16081	
 16082	âWhat does it mean? What is it? Whom are they firing at? Who is
 16083	firing?â RostÃ³v kept asking as he came up to Russian and Austrian
 16084	soldiers running in confused crowds across his path.
 16085	
 16086	âThe devil knows! Theyâve killed everybody! Itâs all up now!â
 16087	he was told in Russian, German, and Czech by the crowd of fugitives who
 16088	understood what was happening as little as he did.
 16089	
 16090	âKill the Germans!â shouted one.
 16091	
 16092	âMay the devil take themâthe traitors!â
 16093	
 16094	âZum Henker diese Russen!â * muttered a German.
 16095	
 16096	    * âHang these Russians!â
 16097	
 16098	
 16099	Several wounded men passed along the road, and words of abuse, screams,
 16100	and groans mingled in a general hubbub, then the firing died down.
 16101	RostÃ³v learned later that Russian and Austrian soldiers had been firing
 16102	at one another.
 16103	
 16104	âMy God! What does it all mean?â thought he. âAnd here, where at
 16105	any moment the Emperor may see them.... But no, these must be only a
 16106	handful of scoundrels. It will soon be over, it canât be that, it
 16107	canât be! Only to get past them quicker, quicker!â
 16108	
 16109	The idea of defeat and flight could not enter RostÃ³vâs head. Though
 16110	he saw French cannon and French troops on the Pratzen Heights just where
 16111	he had been ordered to look for the commander in chief, he could not,
 16112	did not wish to, believe that.
 16113	
 16114	
 16115	
 16116	
 16117	
 16118	CHAPTER XVIII
 16119	
 16120	RostÃ³v had been ordered to look for KutÃºzov and the Emperor near the
 16121	village of Pratzen. But neither they nor a single commanding officer
 16122	were there, only disorganized crowds of troops of various kinds. He
 16123	urged on his already weary horse to get quickly past these crowds, but
 16124	the farther he went the more disorganized they were. The highroad on
 16125	which he had come out was thronged with calÃ¨ches, carriages of all
 16126	sorts, and Russian and Austrian soldiers of all arms, some wounded and
 16127	some not. This whole mass droned and jostled in confusion under the
 16128	dismal influence of cannon balls flying from the French batteries
 16129	stationed on the Pratzen Heights.
 16130	
 16131	âWhere is the Emperor? Where is KutÃºzov?â RostÃ³v kept asking
 16132	everyone he could stop, but got no answer from anyone.
 16133	
 16134	At last seizing a soldier by his collar he forced him to answer.
 16135	
 16136	âEh, brother! Theyâve all bolted long ago!â said the soldier,
 16137	laughing for some reason and shaking himself free.
 16138	
 16139	Having left that soldier who was evidently drunk, RostÃ³v stopped the
 16140	horse of a batman or groom of some important personage and began to
 16141	question him. The man announced that the Tsar had been driven in a
 16142	carriage at full speed about an hour before along that very road and
 16143	that he was dangerously wounded.
 16144	
 16145	âIt canât be!â said RostÃ³v. âIt must have been someone else.â
 16146	
 16147	âI saw him myself,â replied the man with a self-confident smile of
 16148	derision. âI ought to know the Emperor by now, after the times Iâve
 16149	seen him in Petersburg. I saw him just as I see you.... There he sat in
 16150	the carriage as pale as anything. How they made the four black horses
 16151	fly! Gracious me, they did rattle past! Itâs time I knew the Imperial
 16152	horses and IlyÃ¡ IvÃ¡nych. I donât think IlyÃ¡ drives anyone except
 16153	the Tsar!â
 16154	
 16155	RostÃ³v let go of the horse and was about to ride on, when a wounded
 16156	officer passing by addressed him:
 16157	
 16158	âWho is it you want?â he asked. âThe commander in chief? He was
 16159	killed by a cannon ballâstruck in the breast before our regiment.â
 16160	
 16161	âNot killedâwounded!â another officer corrected him.
 16162	
 16163	âWho? KutÃºzov?â asked RostÃ³v.
 16164	
 16165	âNot KutÃºzov, but whatâs his nameâwell, never mind... there are
 16166	not many left alive. Go that way, to that village, all the commanders
 16167	are there,â said the officer, pointing to the village of Hosjeradek,
 16168	and he walked on.
 16169	
 16170	RostÃ³v rode on at a footpace not knowing why or to whom he was now
 16171	going. The Emperor was wounded, the battle lost. It was impossible to
 16172	doubt it now. RostÃ³v rode in the direction pointed out to him, in which
 16173	he saw turrets and a church. What need to hurry? What was he now to say
 16174	to the Tsar or to KutÃºzov, even if they were alive and unwounded?
 16175	
 16176	âTake this road, your honor, that way you will be killed at once!â a
 16177	soldier shouted to him. âTheyâd kill you there!â
 16178	
 16179	âOh, what are you talking about?â said another. âWhere is he to
 16180	go? That way is nearer.â
 16181	
 16182	RostÃ³v considered, and then went in the direction where they said he
 16183	would be killed.
 16184	
 16185	âItâs all the same now. If the Emperor is wounded, am I to try to
 16186	save myself?â he thought. He rode on to the region where the greatest
 16187	number of men had perished in fleeing from Pratzen. The French had not
 16188	yet occupied that region, and the Russiansâthe uninjured and slightly
 16189	woundedâhad left it long ago. All about the field, like heaps of
 16190	manure on well-kept plowland, lay from ten to fifteen dead and wounded
 16191	to each couple of acres. The wounded crept together in twos and threes
 16192	and one could hear their distressing screams and groans, sometimes
 16193	feignedâor so it seemed to RostÃ³v. He put his horse to a trot to
 16194	avoid seeing all these suffering men, and he felt afraidâafraid not
 16195	for his life, but for the courage he needed and which he knew would not
 16196	stand the sight of these unfortunates.
 16197	
 16198	The French, who had ceased firing at this field strewn with dead and
 16199	wounded where there was no one left to fire at, on seeing an adjutant
 16200	riding over it trained a gun on him and fired several shots. The
 16201	sensation of those terrible whistling sounds and of the corpses around
 16202	him merged in RostÃ³vâs mind into a single feeling of terror and pity
 16203	for himself. He remembered his motherâs last letter. âWhat would she
 16204	feel,â thought he, âif she saw me here now on this field with the
 16205	cannon aimed at me?â
 16206	
 16207	In the village of Hosjeradek there were Russian troops retiring from
 16208	the field of battle, who though still in some confusion were less
 16209	disordered. The French cannon did not reach there and the musketry fire
 16210	sounded far away. Here everyone clearly saw and said that the battle
 16211	was lost. No one whom RostÃ³v asked could tell him where the Emperor
 16212	or KutÃºzov was. Some said the report that the Emperor was wounded was
 16213	correct, others that it was not, and explained the false rumor that had
 16214	spread by the fact that the Emperorâs carriage had really galloped
 16215	from the field of battle with the pale and terrified Ober-Hofmarschal
 16216	Count TolstÃ³y, who had ridden out to the battlefield with others in
 16217	the Emperorâs suite. One officer told RostÃ³v that he had seen someone
 16218	from headquarters behind the village to the left, and thither RostÃ³v
 16219	rode, not hoping to find anyone but merely to ease his conscience. When
 16220	he had ridden about two miles and had passed the last of the Russian
 16221	troops, he saw, near a kitchen garden with a ditch round it, two men
 16222	on horseback facing the ditch. One with a white plume in his hat seemed
 16223	familiar to RostÃ³v; the other on a beautiful chestnut horse (which
 16224	RostÃ³v fancied he had seen before) rode up to the ditch, struck his
 16225	horse with his spurs, and giving it the rein leaped lightly over. Only
 16226	a little earth crumbled from the bank under the horseâs hind hoofs.
 16227	Turning the horse sharply, he again jumped the ditch, and deferentially
 16228	addressed the horseman with the white plumes, evidently suggesting
 16229	that he should do the same. The rider, whose figure seemed familiar
 16230	to RostÃ³v and involuntarily riveted his attention, made a gesture of
 16231	refusal with his head and hand and by that gesture RostÃ³v instantly
 16232	recognized his lamented and adored monarch.
 16233	
 16234	âBut it canât be he, alone in the midst of this empty field!â
 16235	thought RostÃ³v. At that moment Alexander turned his head and RostÃ³v
 16236	saw the beloved features that were so deeply engraved on his memory. The
 16237	Emperor was pale, his cheeks sunken and his eyes hollow, but the charm,
 16238	the mildness of his features, was all the greater. RostÃ³v was happy
 16239	in the assurance that the rumors about the Emperor being wounded were
 16240	false. He was happy to be seeing him. He knew that he might and even
 16241	ought to go straight to him and give the message DolgorÃºkov had ordered
 16242	him to deliver.
 16243	
 16244	But as a youth in love trembles, is unnerved, and dares not utter the
 16245	thoughts he has dreamed of for nights, but looks around for help or a
 16246	chance of delay and flight when the longed-for moment comes and he is
 16247	alone with her, so RostÃ³v, now that he had attained what he had longed
 16248	for more than anything else in the world, did not know how to approach
 16249	the Emperor, and a thousand reasons occurred to him why it would be
 16250	inconvenient, unseemly, and impossible to do so.
 16251	
 16252	âWhat! It is as if I were glad of a chance to take advantage of
 16253	his being alone and despondent! A strange face may seem unpleasant or
 16254	painful to him at this moment of sorrow; besides, what can I say to him
 16255	now, when my heart fails me and my mouth feels dry at the mere sight
 16256	of him?â Not one of the innumerable speeches addressed to the Emperor
 16257	that he had composed in his imagination could he now recall. Those
 16258	speeches were intended for quite other conditions, they were for the
 16259	most part to be spoken at a moment of victory and triumph, generally
 16260	when he was dying of wounds and the sovereign had thanked him for heroic
 16261	deeds, and while dying he expressed the love his actions had proved.
 16262	
 16263	âBesides how can I ask the Emperor for his instructions for the right
 16264	flank now that it is nearly four oâclock and the battle is lost?
 16265	No, certainly I must not approach him, I must not intrude on his
 16266	reflections. Better die a thousand times than risk receiving an unkind
 16267	look or bad opinion from him,â RostÃ³v decided; and sorrowfully and
 16268	with a heart full despair he rode away, continually looking back at the
 16269	Tsar, who still remained in the same attitude of indecision.
 16270	
 16271	While RostÃ³v was thus arguing with himself and riding sadly away,
 16272	Captain von Toll chanced to ride to the same spot, and seeing the
 16273	Emperor at once rode up to him, offered his services, and assisted him
 16274	to cross the ditch on foot. The Emperor, wishing to rest and feeling
 16275	unwell, sat down under an apple tree and von Toll remained beside him.
 16276	RostÃ³v from a distance saw with envy and remorse how von Toll spoke
 16277	long and warmly to the Emperor and how the Emperor, evidently weeping,
 16278	covered his eyes with his hand and pressed von Tollâs hand.
 16279	
 16280	âAnd I might have been in his place!â thought RostÃ³v, and hardly
 16281	restraining his tears of pity for the Emperor, he rode on in utter
 16282	despair, not knowing where to or why he was now riding.
 16283	
 16284	His despair was all the greater from feeling that his own weakness was
 16285	the cause of his grief.
 16286	
 16287	He might... not only might but should, have gone up to the sovereign. It
 16288	was a unique chance to show his devotion to the Emperor and he had not
 16289	made use of it.... âWhat have I done?â thought he. And he turned
 16290	round and galloped back to the place where he had seen the Emperor, but
 16291	there was no one beyond the ditch now. Only some carts and carriages
 16292	were passing by. From one of the drivers he learned that KutÃºzovâs
 16293	staff were not far off, in the village the vehicles were going to.
 16294	RostÃ³v followed them. In front of him walked KutÃºzovâs groom leading
 16295	horses in horsecloths. Then came a cart, and behind that walked an old,
 16296	bandy-legged domestic serf in a peaked cap and sheepskin coat.
 16297	
 16298	âTit! I say, Tit!â said the groom.
 16299	
 16300	âWhat?â answered the old man absent-mindedly.
 16301	
 16302	âGo, Tit! Thresh a bit!â
 16303	
 16304	âOh, you fool!â said the old man, spitting angrily. Some time passed
 16305	in silence, and then the same joke was repeated.
 16306	
 16307	
 16308	Before five in the evening the battle had been lost at all points. More
 16309	than a hundred cannon were already in the hands of the French.
 16310	
 16311	PrzebyszÃ©wski and his corps had laid down their arms. Other columns
 16312	after losing half their men were retreating in disorderly confused
 16313	masses.
 16314	
 16315	The remains of Langeronâs and DokhtÃºrovâs mingled forces were
 16316	crowding around the dams and banks of the ponds near the village of
 16317	Augesd.
 16318	
 16319	After five oâclock it was only at the Augesd Dam that a hot cannonade
 16320	(delivered by the French alone) was still to be heard from numerous
 16321	batteries ranged on the slopes of the Pratzen Heights, directed at our
 16322	retreating forces.
 16323	
 16324	In the rearguard, DokhtÃºrov and others rallying some battalions kept up
 16325	a musketry fire at the French cavalry that was pursuing our troops. It
 16326	was growing dusk. On the narrow Augesd Dam where for so many years the
 16327	old miller had been accustomed to sit in his tasseled cap peacefully
 16328	angling, while his grandson, with shirt sleeves rolled up, handled the
 16329	floundering silvery fish in the watering can, on that dam over which for
 16330	so many years Moravians in shaggy caps and blue jackets had peacefully
 16331	driven their two-horse carts loaded with wheat and had returned dusty
 16332	with flour whitening their cartsâon that narrow dam amid the wagons
 16333	and the cannon, under the horsesâ hoofs and between the wagon wheels,
 16334	men disfigured by fear of death now crowded together, crushing one
 16335	another, dying, stepping over the dying and killing one another, only to
 16336	move on a few steps and be killed themselves in the same way.
 16337	
 16338	Every ten seconds a cannon ball flew compressing the air around, or
 16339	a shell burst in the midst of that dense throng, killing some and
 16340	splashing with blood those near them.
 16341	
 16342	DÃ³lokhovânow an officerâwounded in the arm, and on foot, with
 16343	the regimental commander on horseback and some ten men of his company,
 16344	represented all that was left of that whole regiment. Impelled by the
 16345	crowd, they had got wedged in at the approach to the dam and, jammed in
 16346	on all sides, had stopped because a horse in front had fallen under a
 16347	cannon and the crowd were dragging it out. A cannon ball killed someone
 16348	behind them, another fell in front and splashed DÃ³lokhov with blood.
 16349	The crowd, pushing forward desperately, squeezed together, moved a few
 16350	steps, and again stopped.
 16351	
 16352	âMove on a hundred yards and we are certainly saved, remain here
 16353	another two minutes and it is certain death,â thought each one.
 16354	
 16355	DÃ³lokhov who was in the midst of the crowd forced his way to the edge
 16356	of the dam, throwing two soldiers off their feet, and ran onto the
 16357	slippery ice that covered the millpool.
 16358	
 16359	âTurn this way!â he shouted, jumping over the ice which creaked
 16360	under him; âturn this way!â he shouted to those with the gun. âIt
 16361	bears!...â
 16362	
 16363	The ice bore him but it swayed and creaked, and it was plain that it
 16364	would give way not only under a cannon or a crowd, but very soon even
 16365	under his weight alone. The men looked at him and pressed to the
 16366	bank, hesitating to step onto the ice. The general on horseback at the
 16367	entrance to the dam raised his hand and opened his mouth to address
 16368	DÃ³lokhov. Suddenly a cannon ball hissed so low above the crowd that
 16369	everyone ducked. It flopped into something moist, and the general fell
 16370	from his horse in a pool of blood. Nobody gave him a look or thought of
 16371	raising him.
 16372	
 16373	âGet onto the ice, over the ice! Go on! Turn! Donât you hear? Go
 16374	on!â innumerable voices suddenly shouted after the ball had struck
 16375	the general, the men themselves not knowing what, or why, they were
 16376	shouting.
 16377	
 16378	One of the hindmost guns that was going onto the dam turned off onto the
 16379	ice. Crowds of soldiers from the dam began running onto the frozen pond.
 16380	The ice gave way under one of the foremost soldiers, and one leg slipped
 16381	into the water. He tried to right himself but fell in up to his waist.
 16382	The nearest soldiers shrank back, the gun driver stopped his horse, but
 16383	from behind still came the shouts: âOnto the ice, why do you stop? Go
 16384	on! Go on!â And cries of horror were heard in the crowd. The soldiers
 16385	near the gun waved their arms and beat the horses to make them turn and
 16386	move on. The horses moved off the bank. The ice, that had held under
 16387	those on foot, collapsed in a great mass, and some forty men who were on
 16388	it dashed, some forward and some back, drowning one another.
 16389	
 16390	Still the cannon balls continued regularly to whistle and flop onto the
 16391	ice and into the water and oftenest of all among the crowd that covered
 16392	the dam, the pond, and the bank.
 16393

 16398	CHAPTER XIX
 16399	
 16400	On the Pratzen Heights, where he had fallen with the flagstaff in his
 16401	hand, lay Prince Andrew BolkÃ³nski bleeding profusely and unconsciously
 16402	uttering a gentle, piteous, and childlike moan.
 16403	
 16404	Toward evening he ceased moaning and became quite still. He did not know
 16405	how long his unconsciousness lasted. Suddenly he again felt that he was
 16406	alive and suffering from a burning, lacerating pain in his head.
 16407	
 16408	âWhere is it, that lofty sky that I did not know till now, but saw
 16409	today?â was his first thought. âAnd I did not know this suffering
 16410	either,â he thought. âYes, I did not know anything, anything at all
 16411	till now. But where am I?â
 16412	
 16413	He listened and heard the sound of approaching horses, and voices
 16414	speaking French. He opened his eyes. Above him again was the same lofty
 16415	sky with clouds that had risen and were floating still higher, and
 16416	between them gleamed blue infinity. He did not turn his head and did not
 16417	see those who, judging by the sound of hoofs and voices, had ridden up
 16418	and stopped near him.
 16419	
 16420	It was Napoleon accompanied by two aides-de-camp. Bonaparte riding
 16421	over the battlefield had given final orders to strengthen the batteries
 16422	firing at the Augesd Dam and was looking at the killed and wounded left
 16423	on the field.
 16424	
 16425	âFine men!â remarked Napoleon, looking at a dead Russian grenadier,
 16426	who, with his face buried in the ground and a blackened nape, lay on his
 16427	stomach with an already stiffened arm flung wide.
 16428	
 16429	âThe ammunition for the guns in position is exhausted, Your
 16430	Majesty,â said an adjutant who had come from the batteries that were
 16431	firing at Augesd.
 16432	
 16433	âHave some brought from the reserve,â said Napoleon, and having gone
 16434	on a few steps he stopped before Prince Andrew, who lay on his back with
 16435	the flagstaff that had been dropped beside him. (The flag had already
 16436	been taken by the French as a trophy.)
 16437	
 16438	âThatâs a fine death!â said Napoleon as he gazed at BolkÃ³nski.
 16439	
 16440	Prince Andrew understood that this was said of him and that it was
 16441	Napoleon who said it. He heard the speaker addressed as Sire. But he
 16442	heard the words as he might have heard the buzzing of a fly. Not only
 16443	did they not interest him, but he took no notice of them and at once
 16444	forgot them. His head was burning, he felt himself bleeding to death,
 16445	and he saw above him the remote, lofty, and everlasting sky. He knew it
 16446	was Napoleonâhis heroâbut at that moment Napoleon seemed to him
 16447	such a small, insignificant creature compared with what was passing now
 16448	between himself and that lofty infinite sky with the clouds flying over
 16449	it. At that moment it meant nothing to him who might be standing over
 16450	him, or what was said of him; he was only glad that people were standing
 16451	near him and only wished that they would help him and bring him back to
 16452	life, which seemed to him so beautiful now that he had today learned to
 16453	understand it so differently. He collected all his strength, to stir and
 16454	utter a sound. He feebly moved his leg and uttered a weak, sickly groan
 16455	which aroused his own pity.
 16456	
 16457	âAh! He is alive,â said Napoleon. âLift this young man up and
 16458	carry him to the dressing station.â
 16459	
 16460	Having said this, Napoleon rode on to meet Marshal Lannes, who, hat in
 16461	hand, rode up smiling to the Emperor to congratulate him on the victory.
 16462	
 16463	Prince Andrew remembered nothing more: he lost consciousness from the
 16464	terrible pain of being lifted onto the stretcher, the jolting while
 16465	being moved, and the probing of his wound at the dressing station.
 16466	He did not regain consciousness till late in the day, when with other
 16467	wounded and captured Russian officers he was carried to the hospital.
 16468	During this transfer he felt a little stronger and was able to look
 16469	about him and even speak.
 16470	
 16471	The first words he heard on coming to his senses were those of a French
 16472	convoy officer, who said rapidly: âWe must halt here: the Emperor
 16473	will pass here immediately; it will please him to see these gentlemen
 16474	prisoners.â
 16475	
 16476	âThere are so many prisoners today, nearly the whole Russian army,
 16477	that he is probably tired of them,â said another officer.
 16478	
 16479	âAll the same! They say this one is the commander of all the Emperor
 16480	Alexanderâs Guards,â said the first one, indicating a Russian
 16481	officer in the white uniform of the Horse Guards.
 16482	
 16483	BolkÃ³nski recognized Prince RepnÃ­n whom he had met in Petersburg
 16484	society. Beside him stood a lad of nineteen, also a wounded officer of
 16485	the Horse Guards.
 16486	
 16487	Bonaparte, having come up at a gallop, stopped his horse.
 16488	
 16489	âWhich is the senior?â he asked, on seeing the prisoners.
 16490	
 16491	They named the colonel, Prince RepnÃ­n.
 16492	
 16493	âYou are the commander of the Emperor Alexanderâs regiment of Horse
 16494	Guards?â asked Napoleon.
 16495	
 16496	âI commanded a squadron,â replied RepnÃ­n.
 16497	
 16498	âYour regiment fulfilled its duty honorably,â said Napoleon.
 16499	
 16500	âThe praise of a great commander is a soldierâs highest reward,â
 16501	said RepnÃ­n.
 16502	
 16503	âI bestow it with pleasure,â said Napoleon. âAnd who is that young
 16504	man beside you?â
 16505	
 16506	Prince RepnÃ­n named Lieutenant SukhtÃ©len.
 16507	
 16508	After looking at him Napoleon smiled.
 16509	
 16510	âHeâs very young to come to meddle with us.â
 16511	
 16512	âYouth is no hindrance to courage,â muttered SukhtÃ©len in a failing
 16513	voice.
 16514	
 16515	âA splendid reply!â said Napoleon. âYoung man, you will go far!â
 16516	
 16517	Prince Andrew, who had also been brought forward before the Emperorâs
 16518	eyes to complete the show of prisoners, could not fail to attract his
 16519	attention. Napoleon apparently remembered seeing him on the battlefield
 16520	and, addressing him, again used the epithet âyoung manâ that was
 16521	connected in his memory with Prince Andrew.
 16522	
 16523	âWell, and you, young man,â said he. âHow do you feel, mon
 16524	brave?â
 16525	
 16526	Though five minutes before, Prince Andrew had been able to say a few
 16527	words to the soldiers who were carrying him, now with his eyes fixed
 16528	straight on Napoleon, he was silent.... So insignificant at that moment
 16529	seemed to him all the interests that engrossed Napoleon, so mean did his
 16530	hero himself with his paltry vanity and joy in victory appear,
 16531	compared to the lofty, equitable, and kindly sky which he had seen and
 16532	understood, that he could not answer him.
 16533	
 16534	Everything seemed so futile and insignificant in comparison with the
 16535	stern and solemn train of thought that weakness from loss of blood,
 16536	suffering, and the nearness of death aroused in him. Looking into
 16537	Napoleonâs eyes Prince Andrew thought of the insignificance of
 16538	greatness, the unimportance of life which no one could understand, and
 16539	the still greater unimportance of death, the meaning of which no one
 16540	alive could understand or explain.
 16541	
 16542	The Emperor without waiting for an answer turned away and said to one of
 16543	the officers as he went: âHave these gentlemen attended to and taken
 16544	to my bivouac; let my doctor, Larrey, examine their wounds. Au revoir,
 16545	Prince RepnÃ­n!â and he spurred his horse and galloped away.
 16546	
 16547	His face shone with self-satisfaction and pleasure.
 16548	
 16549	The soldiers who had carried Prince Andrew had noticed and taken the
 16550	little gold icon Princess Mary had hung round her brotherâs neck, but
 16551	seeing the favor the Emperor showed the prisoners, they now hastened to
 16552	return the holy image.
 16553	
 16554	Prince Andrew did not see how and by whom it was replaced, but the
 16555	little icon with its thin gold chain suddenly appeared upon his chest
 16556	outside his uniform.
 16557	
 16558	âIt would be good,â thought Prince Andrew, glancing at the icon his
 16559	sister had hung round his neck with such emotion and reverence, âit
 16560	would be good if everything were as clear and simple as it seems to
 16561	Mary. How good it would be to know where to seek for help in this life,
 16562	and what to expect after it beyond the grave! How happy and calm I
 16563	should be if I could now say: âLord, have mercy on me!â... But to
 16564	whom should I say that? Either to a Power indefinable, incomprehensible,
 16565	which I not only cannot address but which I cannot even express in
 16566	wordsâthe Great All or Nothing-â said he to himself, âor to
 16567	that God who has been sewn into this amulet by Mary! There is nothing
 16568	certain, nothing at all except the unimportance of everything I
 16569	understand, and the greatness of something incomprehensible but
 16570	all-important.â
 16571	
 16572	The stretchers moved on. At every jolt he again felt unendurable pain;
 16573	his feverishness increased and he grew delirious. Visions of his father,
 16574	wife, sister, and future son, and the tenderness he had felt the night
 16575	before the battle, the figure of the insignificant little Napoleon, and
 16576	above all this the lofty sky, formed the chief subjects of his delirious
 16577	fancies.
 16578	
 16579	The quiet home life and peaceful happiness of Bald Hills presented
 16580	itself to him. He was already enjoying that happiness when that
 16581	little Napoleon had suddenly appeared with his unsympathizing look of
 16582	shortsighted delight at the misery of others, and doubts and torments
 16583	had followed, and only the heavens promised peace. Toward morning
 16584	all these dreams melted and merged into the chaos and darkness of
 16585	unconciousness and oblivion which in the opinion of Napoleonâs doctor,
 16586	Larrey, was much more likely to end in death than in convalescence.
 16587	
 16588	âHe is a nervous, bilious subject,â said Larrey, âand will not
 16589	recover.â
 16590	
 16591	And Prince Andrew, with others fatally wounded, was left to the care of
 16592	the inhabitants of the district.

 16604	CHAPTER I
 16605	
 16606	Early in the year 1806 Nicholas RostÃ³v returned home on leave. DenÃ­sov
 16607	was going home to VorÃ³nezh and RostÃ³v persuaded him to travel with him
 16608	as far as Moscow and to stay with him there. Meeting a comrade at
 16609	the last post station but one before Moscow, DenÃ­sov had drunk three
 16610	bottles of wine with him and, despite the jolting ruts across the
 16611	snow-covered road, did not once wake up on the way to Moscow, but lay
 16612	at the bottom of the sleigh beside RostÃ³v, who grew more and more
 16613	impatient the nearer they got to Moscow.
 16614	
 16615	âHow much longer? How much longer? Oh, these insufferable streets,
 16616	shops, bakersâ signboards, street lamps, and sleighs!â thought
 16617	RostÃ³v, when their leave permits had been passed at the town gate and
 16618	they had entered Moscow.
 16619	
 16620	âDenÃ­sov! Weâre here! Heâs asleep,â he added, leaning forward
 16621	with his whole body as if in that position he hoped to hasten the speed
 16622	of the sleigh.
 16623	
 16624	DenÃ­sov gave no answer.
 16625	
 16626	âThereâs the corner at the crossroads, where the cabman, ZakhÃ¡r,
 16627	has his stand, and thereâs ZakhÃ¡r himself and still the same horse!
 16628	And hereâs the little shop where we used to buy gingerbread! Canât
 16629	you hurry up? Now then!â
 16630	
 16631	âWhich house is it?â asked the driver.
 16632	
 16633	âWhy, that one, right at the end, the big one. Donât you see?
 16634	Thatâs our house,â said RostÃ³v. âOf course, itâs our house!
 16635	DenÃ­sov, DenÃ­sov! Weâre almost there!â
 16636	
 16637	DenÃ­sov raised his head, coughed, and made no answer.
 16638	
 16639	âDmÃ­tri,â said RostÃ³v to his valet on the box, âthose lights are
 16640	in our house, arenât they?â
 16641	
 16642	âYes, sir, and thereâs a light in your fatherâs study.â
 16643	
 16644	âThen theyâve not gone to bed yet? What do you think? Mind now,
 16645	donât forget to put out my new coat,â added RostÃ³v, fingering his
 16646	new mustache. âNow then, get on,â he shouted to the driver. âDo
 16647	wake up, VÃ¡ska!â he went on, turning to DenÃ­sov, whose head
 16648	was again nodding. âCome, get on! You shall have three rubles for
 16649	vodkaâget on!â RostÃ³v shouted, when the sleigh was only three
 16650	houses from his door. It seemed to him the horses were not moving at
 16651	all. At last the sleigh bore to the right, drew up at an entrance, and
 16652	RostÃ³v saw overhead the old familiar cornice with a bit of plaster
 16653	broken off, the porch, and the post by the side of the pavement. He
 16654	sprang out before the sleigh stopped, and ran into the hall. The house
 16655	stood cold and silent, as if quite regardless of who had come to it.
 16656	There was no one in the hall. âOh God! Is everyone all right?â
 16657	he thought, stopping for a moment with a sinking heart, and then
 16658	immediately starting to run along the hall and up the warped steps of
 16659	the familiar staircase. The well-known old door handle, which always
 16660	angered the countess when it was not properly cleaned, turned as loosely
 16661	as ever. A solitary tallow candle burned in the anteroom.
 16662	
 16663	Old Michael was asleep on the chest. ProkÃ³fy, the footman, who was
 16664	so strong that he could lift the back of the carriage from behind, sat
 16665	plaiting slippers out of cloth selvedges. He looked up at the opening
 16666	door and his expression of sleepy indifference suddenly changed to one
 16667	of delighted amazement.
 16668	
 16669	âGracious heavens! The young count!â he cried, recognizing his
 16670	young master. âCan it be? My treasure!â and ProkÃ³fy, trembling with
 16671	excitement, rushed toward the drawing room door, probably in order to
 16672	announce him, but, changing his mind, came back and stooped to kiss the
 16673	young manâs shoulder.
 16674	
 16675	âAll well?â asked RostÃ³v, drawing away his arm.
 16676	
 16677	âYes, God be thanked! Yes! Theyâve just finished supper. Let me have
 16678	a look at you, your excellency.â
 16679	
 16680	âIs everything quite all right?â
 16681	
 16682	âThe Lord be thanked, yes!â
 16683	
 16684	RostÃ³v, who had completely forgotten DenÃ­sov, not wishing anyone to
 16685	forestall him, threw off his fur coat and ran on tiptoe through the
 16686	large dark ballroom. All was the same: there were the same old card
 16687	tables and the same chandelier with a cover over it; but someone had
 16688	already seen the young master, and, before he had reached the drawing
 16689	room, something flew out from a side door like a tornado and began
 16690	hugging and kissing him. Another and yet another creature of the same
 16691	kind sprang from a second door and a third; more hugging, more kissing,
 16692	more outcries, and tears of joy. He could not distinguish which was
 16693	Papa, which NatÃ¡sha, and which PÃ©tya. Everyone shouted, talked, and
 16694	kissed him at the same time. Only his mother was not there, he noticed
 16695	that.
 16696	
 16697	âAnd I did not know... Nicholas... My darling!...â
 16698	
 16699	âHere he is... our own... KÃ³lya, * dear fellow... How he has
 16700	changed!... Where are the candles?... Tea!...â
 16701	
 16702	    * Nicholas.
 16703	
 16704	âAnd me, kiss me!â
 16705	
 16706	âDearest... and me!â
 16707	
 16708	SÃ³nya, NatÃ¡sha, PÃ©tya, Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, VÃ©ra, and the old count
 16709	were all hugging him, and the serfs, men and maids, flocked into the
 16710	room, exclaiming and oh-ing and ah-ing.
 16711	
 16712	PÃ©tya, clinging to his legs, kept shouting, âAnd me too!â
 16713	
 16714	NatÃ¡sha, after she had pulled him down toward her and covered his face
 16715	with kisses, holding him tight by the skirt of his coat, sprang away and
 16716	pranced up and down in one place like a goat and shrieked piercingly.
 16717	
 16718	All around were loving eyes glistening with tears of joy, and all around
 16719	were lips seeking a kiss.
 16720	
 16721	SÃ³nya too, all rosy red, clung to his arm and, radiant with bliss,
 16722	looked eagerly toward his eyes, waiting for the look for which she
 16723	longed. SÃ³nya now was sixteen and she was very pretty, especially at
 16724	this moment of happy, rapturous excitement. She gazed at him, not taking
 16725	her eyes off him, and smiling and holding her breath. He gave her a
 16726	grateful look, but was still expectant and looking for someone. The old
 16727	countess had not yet come. But now steps were heard at the door, steps
 16728	so rapid that they could hardly be his motherâs.
 16729	
 16730	Yet it was she, dressed in a new gown which he did not know, made since
 16731	he had left. All the others let him go, and he ran to her. When they
 16732	met, she fell on his breast, sobbing. She could not lift her face, but
 16733	only pressed it to the cold braiding of his hussarâs jacket. DenÃ­sov,
 16734	who had come into the room unnoticed by anyone, stood there and wiped
 16735	his eyes at the sight.
 16736	
 16737	âVasÃ­li DenÃ­sov, your sonâs friend,â he said, introducing
 16738	himself to the count, who was looking inquiringly at him.
 16739	
 16740	âYou are most welcome! I know, I know,â said the count, kissing and
 16741	embracing DenÃ­sov. âNicholas wrote us... NatÃ¡sha, VÃ©ra, look! Here
 16742	is DenÃ­sov!â
 16743	
 16744	The same happy, rapturous faces turned to the shaggy figure of DenÃ­sov.
 16745	
 16746	âDarling DenÃ­sov!â screamed NatÃ¡sha, beside herself with rapture,
 16747	springing to him, putting her arms round him, and kissing him. This
 16748	escapade made everybody feel confused. DenÃ­sov blushed too, but smiled
 16749	and, taking NatÃ¡shaâs hand, kissed it.
 16750	
 16751	DenÃ­sov was shown to the room prepared for him, and the RostÃ³vs all
 16752	gathered round Nicholas in the sitting room.
 16753	
 16754	The old countess, not letting go of his hand and kissing it every
 16755	moment, sat beside him: the rest, crowding round him, watched every
 16756	movement, word, or look of his, never taking their blissfully adoring
 16757	eyes off him. His brother and sisters struggled for the places nearest
 16758	to him and disputed with one another who should bring him his tea,
 16759	handkerchief, and pipe.
 16760	
 16761	RostÃ³v was very happy in the love they showed him; but the first
 16762	moment of meeting had been so beatific that his present joy seemed
 16763	insufficient, and he kept expecting something more, more and yet more.
 16764	
 16765	Next morning, after the fatigues of their journey, the travelers slept
 16766	till ten oâclock.
 16767	
 16768	In the room next their bedroom there was a confusion of sabers,
 16769	satchels, sabretaches, open portmanteaus, and dirty boots. Two freshly
 16770	cleaned pairs with spurs had just been placed by the wall. The servants
 16771	were bringing in jugs and basins, hot water for shaving, and their
 16772	well-brushed clothes. There was a masculine odor and a smell of tobacco.
 16773	
 16774	âHallo, GwÃ­skaâmy pipe!â came VasÃ­li DenÃ­sovâs husky voice.
 16775	âWostÃ³v, get up!â
 16776	
 16777	RostÃ³v, rubbing his eyes that seemed glued together, raised his
 16778	disheveled head from the hot pillow.
 16779	
 16780	âWhy, is it late?â
 16781	
 16782	âLate! Itâs nearly ten oâclock,â answered NatÃ¡shaâs voice.
 16783	A rustle of starched petticoats and the whispering and laughter of
 16784	girlsâ voices came from the adjoining room. The door was opened a
 16785	crack and there was a glimpse of something blue, of ribbons, black hair,
 16786	and merry faces. It was NatÃ¡sha, SÃ³nya, and PÃ©tya, who had come to
 16787	see whether they were getting up.
 16788	
 16789	âNicholas! Get up!â NatÃ¡shaâs voice was again heard at the door.
 16790	
 16791	âDirectly!â
 16792	
 16793	Meanwhile, PÃ©tya, having found and seized the sabers in the outer room,
 16794	with the delight boys feel at the sight of a military elder brother, and
 16795	forgetting that it was unbecoming for the girls to see men undressed,
 16796	opened the bedroom door.
 16797	
 16798	âIs this your saber?â he shouted.
 16799	
 16800	The girls sprang aside. DenÃ­sov hid his hairy legs under the blanket,
 16801	looking with a scared face at his comrade for help. The door, having let
 16802	PÃ©tya in, closed again. A sound of laughter came from behind it.
 16803	
 16804	âNicholas! Come out in your dressing gown!â said NatÃ¡shaâs voice.
 16805	
 16806	âIs this your saber?â asked PÃ©tya. âOr is it yours?â he said,
 16807	addressing the black-mustached DenÃ­sov with servile deference.
 16808	
 16809	RostÃ³v hurriedly put something on his feet, drew on his dressing gown,
 16810	and went out. NatÃ¡sha had put on one spurred boot and was just getting
 16811	her foot into the other. SÃ³nya, when he came in, was twirling round and
 16812	was about to expand her dresses into a balloon and sit down. They were
 16813	dressed alike, in new pale-blue frocks, and were both fresh, rosy, and
 16814	bright. SÃ³nya ran away, but NatÃ¡sha, taking her brotherâs arm, led
 16815	him into the sitting room, where they began talking. They hardly gave
 16816	one another time to ask questions and give replies concerning a thousand
 16817	little matters which could not interest anyone but themselves. NatÃ¡sha
 16818	laughed at every word he said or that she said herself, not because what
 16819	they were saying was amusing, but because she felt happy and was unable
 16820	to control her joy which expressed itself by laughter.
 16821	
 16822	âOh, how nice, how splendid!â she said to everything.
 16823	
 16824	RostÃ³v felt that, under the influence of the warm rays of love, that
 16825	childlike smile which had not once appeared on his face since he left
 16826	home now for the first time after eighteen months again brightened his
 16827	soul and his face.
 16828	
 16829	âNo, but listen,â she said, ânow you are quite a man, arenât
 16830	you? Iâm awfully glad youâre my brother.â She touched his
 16831	mustache. âI want to know what you men are like. Are you the same as
 16832	we? No?â
 16833	
 16834	âWhy did SÃ³nya run away?â asked RostÃ³v.
 16835	
 16836	âAh, yes! Thatâs a whole long story! How are you going to speak to
 16837	herâthou or you?â
 16838	
 16839	âAs may happen,â said RostÃ³v.
 16840	
 16841	âNo, call her you, please! Iâll tell you all about it some other
 16842	time. No, Iâll tell you now. You know SÃ³nyaâs my dearest friend.
 16843	Such a friend that I burned my arm for her sake. Look here!â
 16844	
 16845	She pulled up her muslin sleeve and showed him a red scar on her long,
 16846	slender, delicate arm, high above the elbow on that part that is covered
 16847	even by a ball dress.
 16848	
 16849	âI burned this to prove my love for her. I just heated a ruler in the
 16850	fire and pressed it there!â
 16851	
 16852	Sitting on the sofa with the little cushions on its arms, in what used
 16853	to be his old schoolroom, and looking into NatÃ¡shaâs wildly bright
 16854	eyes, RostÃ³v re-entered that world of home and childhood which had no
 16855	meaning for anyone else, but gave him some of the best joys of his life;
 16856	and the burning of an arm with a ruler as a proof of love did not seem
 16857	to him senseless, he understood and was not surprised at it.
 16858	
 16859	âWell, and is that all?â he asked.
 16860	
 16861	âWe are such friends, such friends! All that ruler business was just
 16862	nonsense, but we are friends forever. She, if she loves anyone, does it
 16863	for life, but I donât understand that, I forget quickly.â
 16864	
 16865	âWell, what then?â
 16866	
 16867	âWell, she loves me and you like that.â
 16868	
 16869	NatÃ¡sha suddenly flushed.
 16870	
 16871	âWhy, you remember before you went away?... Well, she says you are to
 16872	forget all that.... She says: âI shall love him always, but let him be
 16873	free.â Isnât that lovely and noble! Yes, very noble? Isnât it?â
 16874	asked NatÃ¡sha, so seriously and excitedly that it was evident that what
 16875	she was now saying she had talked of before, with tears.
 16876	
 16877	RostÃ³v became thoughtful.
 16878	
 16879	âI never go back on my word,â he said. âBesides, SÃ³nya is so
 16880	charming that only a fool would renounce such happiness.â
 16881	
 16882	âNo, no!â cried NatÃ¡sha, âshe and I have already talked it over.
 16883	We knew youâd say so. But it wonât do, because you see, if you say
 16884	thatâif you consider yourself bound by your promiseâit will seem as
 16885	if she had not meant it seriously. It makes it as if you were marrying
 16886	her because you must, and that wouldnât do at all.â
 16887	
 16888	RostÃ³v saw that it had been well considered by them. SÃ³nya had already
 16889	struck him by her beauty on the preceding day. Today, when he had caught
 16890	a glimpse of her, she seemed still more lovely. She was a charming girl
 16891	of sixteen, evidently passionately in love with him (he did not doubt
 16892	that for an instant). Why should he not love her now, and even marry
 16893	her, RostÃ³v thought, but just now there were so many other pleasures
 16894	and interests before him! âYes, they have taken a wise decision,â he
 16895	thought, âI must remain free.â
 16896	
 16897	âWell then, thatâs excellent,â said he. âWeâll talk it over
 16898	later on. Oh, how glad I am to have you!â
 16899	
 16900	âWell, and are you still true to BorÃ­s?â he continued.
 16901	
 16902	âOh, what nonsense!â cried NatÃ¡sha, laughing. âI donât think
 16903	about him or anyone else, and I donât want anything of the kind.â
 16904	
 16905	âDear me! Then what are you up to now?â
 16906	
 16907	âNow?â repeated NatÃ¡sha, and a happy smile lit up her face. âHave
 16908	you seen Duport?â
 16909	
 16910	âNo.â
 16911	
 16912	âNot seen Duportâthe famous dancer? Well then, you wonât
 16913	understand. Thatâs what Iâm up to.â
 16914	
 16915	Curving her arms, NatÃ¡sha held out her skirts as dancers do, ran back
 16916	a few steps, turned, cut a caper, brought her little feet sharply
 16917	together, and made some steps on the very tips of her toes.
 16918	
 16919	âSee, Iâm standing! See!â she said, but could not maintain herself
 16920	on her toes any longer. âSo thatâs what Iâm up to! Iâll never
 16921	marry anyone, but will be a dancer. Only donât tell anyone.â
 16922	
 16923	RostÃ³v laughed so loud and merrily that DenÃ­sov, in his bedroom, felt
 16924	envious and NatÃ¡sha could not help joining in.
 16925	
 16926	âNo, but donât you think itâs nice?â she kept repeating.
 16927	
 16928	âNice! And so you no longer wish to marry BorÃ­s?â
 16929	
 16930	NatÃ¡sha flared up. âI donât want to marry anyone. And Iâll tell
 16931	him so when I see him!â
 16932	
 16933	âDear me!â said RostÃ³v.
 16934	
 16935	âBut thatâs all rubbish,â NatÃ¡sha chattered on. âAnd is
 16936	DenÃ­sov nice?â she asked.
 16937	
 16938	âYes, indeed!â
 16939	
 16940	âOh, well then, good-by: go and dress. Is he very terrible,
 16941	DenÃ­sov?â
 16942	
 16943	âWhy terrible?â asked Nicholas. âNo, VÃ¡ska is a splendid
 16944	fellow.â
 16945	
 16946	âYou call him VÃ¡ska? Thatâs funny! And is he very nice?â
 16947	
 16948	âVery.â
 16949	
 16950	âWell then, be quick. Weâll all have breakfast together.â
 16951	
 16952	And NatÃ¡sha rose and went out of the room on tiptoe, like a ballet
 16953	dancer, but smiling as only happy girls of fifteen can smile. When
 16954	RostÃ³v met SÃ³nya in the drawing room, he reddened. He did not know
 16955	how to behave with her. The evening before, in the first happy moment of
 16956	meeting, they had kissed each other, but today they felt it could not
 16957	be done; he felt that everybody, including his mother and sisters, was
 16958	looking inquiringly at him and watching to see how he would behave
 16959	with her. He kissed her hand and addressed her not as thou but as
 16960	youâSÃ³nya. But their eyes met and said thou, and exchanged tender
 16961	kisses. Her looks asked him to forgive her for having dared, by
 16962	NatÃ¡shaâs intermediacy, to remind him of his promise, and then
 16963	thanked him for his love. His looks thanked her for offering him his
 16964	freedom and told her that one way or another he would never cease to
 16965	love her, for that would be impossible.
 16966	
 16967	âHow strange it is,â said VÃ©ra, selecting a moment when all were
 16968	silent, âthat SÃ³nya and Nicholas now say you to one another and meet
 16969	like strangers.â
 16970	
 16971	VÃ©raâs remark was correct, as her remarks always were, but, like
 16972	most of her observations, it made everyone feel uncomfortable, not
 16973	only SÃ³nya, Nicholas, and NatÃ¡sha, but even the old countess,
 16974	whoâdreading this love affair which might hinder Nicholas from making
 16975	a brilliant matchâblushed like a girl.
 16976	
 16977	DenÃ­sov, to RostÃ³vâs surprise, appeared in the drawing room with
 16978	pomaded hair, perfumed, and in a new uniform, looking just as smart as
 16979	he made himself when going into battle, and he was more amiable to the
 16980	ladies and gentlemen than RostÃ³v had ever expected to see him.
 16981	
 16982	
 16983	
 16984	
 16985	
 16986	CHAPTER II
 16987	
 16988	On his return to Moscow from the army, Nicholas RostÃ³v was welcomed
 16989	by his home circle as the best of sons, a hero, and their darling
 16990	NikÃ³lenka; by his relations as a charming, attractive, and polite young
 16991	man; by his acquaintances as a handsome lieutenant of hussars, a good
 16992	dancer, and one of the best matches in the city.
 16993	
 16994	The RostÃ³vs knew everybody in Moscow. The old count had money enough
 16995	that year, as all his estates had been remortgaged, and so Nicholas,
 16996	acquiring a trotter of his own, very stylish riding breeches of the
 16997	latest cut, such as no one else yet had in Moscow, and boots of the
 16998	latest fashion, with extremely pointed toes and small silver spurs,
 16999	passed his time very gaily. After a short period of adapting himself
 17000	to the old conditions of life, Nicholas found it very pleasant to be
 17001	at home again. He felt that he had grown up and matured very much. His
 17002	despair at failing in a Scripture examination, his borrowing money from
 17003	GavrÃ­l to pay a sleigh driver, his kissing SÃ³nya on the slyâhe now
 17004	recalled all this as childishness he had left immeasurably behind.
 17005	Now he was a lieutenant of hussars, in a jacket laced with silver, and
 17006	wearing the Cross of St. George, awarded to soldiers for bravery in
 17007	action, and in the company of well-known, elderly, and respected racing
 17008	men was training a trotter of his own for a race. He knew a lady on one
 17009	of the boulevards whom he visited of an evening. He led the mazurka
 17010	at the ArkhÃ¡rovsâ ball, talked about the war with Field Marshal
 17011	KÃ¡menski, visited the English Club, and was on intimate terms with a
 17012	colonel of forty to whom DenÃ­sov had introduced him.
 17013	
 17014	His passion for the Emperor had cooled somewhat in Moscow. But still, as
 17015	he did not see him and had no opportunity of seeing him, he often spoke
 17016	about him and about his love for him, letting it be understood that he
 17017	had not told all and that there was something in his feelings for the
 17018	Emperor not everyone could understand, and with his whole soul he shared
 17019	the adoration then common in Moscow for the Emperor, who was spoken of
 17020	as the âangel incarnate.â
 17021	
 17022	During RostÃ³vâs short stay in Moscow, before rejoining the army, he
 17023	did not draw closer to SÃ³nya, but rather drifted away from her. She was
 17024	very pretty and sweet, and evidently deeply in love with him, but he was
 17025	at the period of youth when there seems so much to do that there is no
 17026	time for that sort of thing and a young man fears to bind himself and
 17027	prizes his freedom which he needs for so many other things. When he
 17028	thought of SÃ³nya, during this stay in Moscow, he said to himself,
 17029	âAh, there will be, and there are, many more such girls somewhere whom
 17030	I do not yet know. There will be time enough to think about love when I
 17031	want to, but now I have no time.â Besides, it seemed to him that the
 17032	society of women was rather derogatory to his manhood. He went to balls
 17033	and into ladiesâ society with an affectation of doing so against his
 17034	will. The races, the English Club, sprees with DenÃ­sov, and visits to
 17035	a certain houseâthat was another matter and quite the thing for a
 17036	dashing young hussar!
 17037	
 17038	At the beginning of March, old Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v was very busy
 17039	arranging a dinner in honor of Prince BagratiÃ³n at the English Club.
 17040	
 17041	The count walked up and down the hall in his dressing gown, giving
 17042	orders to the club steward and to the famous FeoktÃ­st, the clubâs
 17043	head cook, about asparagus, fresh cucumbers, strawberries, veal, and
 17044	fish for this dinner. The count had been a member and on the committee
 17045	of the club from the day it was founded. To him the club entrusted the
 17046	arrangement of the festival in honor of BagratiÃ³n, for few men knew
 17047	so well how to arrange a feast on an open-handed, hospitable scale,
 17048	and still fewer men would be so well able and willing to make up out of
 17049	their own resources what might be needed for the success of the fete.
 17050	The club cook and the steward listened to the countâs orders with
 17051	pleased faces, for they knew that under no other management could they
 17052	so easily extract a good profit for themselves from a dinner costing
 17053	several thousand rubles.
 17054	
 17055	âWell then, mind and have cocksâ comb in the turtle soup, you
 17056	know!â
 17057	
 17058	âShall we have three cold dishes then?â asked the cook.
 17059	
 17060	The count considered.
 17061	
 17062	âWe canât have lessâyes, three... the mayonnaise, thatâs one,â
 17063	said he, bending down a finger.
 17064	
 17065	âThen am I to order those large sterlets?â asked the steward.
 17066	
 17067	âYes, it canât be helped if they wonât take less. Ah, dear me! I
 17068	was forgetting. We must have another entrÃ©e. Ah, goodness gracious!â
 17069	he clutched at his head. âWho is going to get me the flowers? DmÃ­tri!
 17070	Eh, DmÃ­tri! Gallop off to our Moscow estate,â he said to the factotum
 17071	who appeared at his call. âHurry off and tell MaksÃ­m, the gardener,
 17072	to set the serfs to work. Say that everything out of the hothouses must
 17073	be brought here well wrapped up in felt. I must have two hundred pots
 17074	here on Friday.â
 17075	
 17076	Having given several more orders, he was about to go to his âlittle
 17077	countessâ to have a rest, but remembering something else of
 17078	importance, he returned again, called back the cook and the club
 17079	steward, and again began giving orders. A light footstep and the
 17080	clinking of spurs were heard at the door, and the young count, handsome,
 17081	rosy, with a dark little mustache, evidently rested and made sleeker by
 17082	his easy life in Moscow, entered the room.
 17083	
 17084	âAh, my boy, my headâs in a whirl!â said the old man with a smile,
 17085	as if he felt a little confused before his son. âNow, if you would
 17086	only help a bit! I must have singers too. I shall have my own orchestra,
 17087	but shouldnât we get the gypsy singers as well? You military men like
 17088	that sort of thing.â
 17089	
 17090	âReally, Papa, I believe Prince BagratiÃ³n worried himself less before
 17091	the battle of SchÃ¶n Grabern than you do now,â said his son with a
 17092	smile.
 17093	
 17094	The old count pretended to be angry.
 17095	
 17096	âYes, you talk, but try it yourself!â
 17097	
 17098	And the count turned to the cook, who, with a shrewd and respectful
 17099	expression, looked observantly and sympathetically at the father and
 17100	son.
 17101	
 17102	âWhat have the young people come to nowadays, eh, FeoktÃ­st?â said
 17103	he. âLaughing at us old fellows!â
 17104	
 17105	âThatâs so, your excellency, all they have to do is to eat a good
 17106	dinner, but providing it and serving it all up, thatâs not their
 17107	business!â
 17108	
 17109	âThatâs it, thatâs it!â exclaimed the count, and gaily seizing
 17110	his son by both hands, he cried, âNow Iâve got you, so take the
 17111	sleigh and pair at once, and go to BezÃºkhovâs, and tell him âCount
 17112	IlyÃ¡ has sent you to ask for strawberries and fresh pineapples.â We
 17113	canât get them from anyone else. Heâs not there himself, so youâll
 17114	have to go in and ask the princesses; and from there go on to the
 17115	RasgulyÃ¡yâthe coachman IpÃ¡tka knowsâand look up the gypsy
 17116	IlyÃºshka, the one who danced at Count OrlÃ³vâs, you remember, in a
 17117	white Cossack coat, and bring him along to me.â
 17118	
 17119	âAnd am I to bring the gypsy girls along with him?â asked Nicholas,
 17120	laughing. âDear, dear!...â
 17121	
 17122	At that moment, with noiseless footsteps and with the businesslike,
 17123	preoccupied, yet meekly Christian look which never left her face, Anna
 17124	MikhÃ¡ylovna entered the hall. Though she came upon the count in his
 17125	dressing gown every day, he invariably became confused and begged her to
 17126	excuse his costume.
 17127	
 17128	âNo matter at all, my dear count,â she said, meekly closing her
 17129	eyes. âBut Iâll go to BezÃºkhovâs myself. Pierre has arrived, and
 17130	now we shall get anything we want from his hothouses. I have to see him
 17131	in any case. He has forwarded me a letter from BorÃ­s. Thank God, BorÃ­s
 17132	is now on the staff.â
 17133	
 17134	The count was delighted at Anna MikhÃ¡ylovnaâs taking upon herself one
 17135	of his commissions and ordered the small closed carriage for her.
 17136	
 17137	âTell BezÃºkhov to come. Iâll put his name down. Is his wife with
 17138	him?â he asked.
 17139	
 17140	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna turned up her eyes, and profound sadness was depicted
 17141	on her face.
 17142	
 17143	âAh, my dear friend, he is very unfortunate,â she said. âIf what
 17144	we hear is true, it is dreadful. How little we dreamed of such a thing
 17145	when we were rejoicing at his happiness! And such a lofty angelic soul
 17146	as young BezÃºkhov! Yes, I pity him from my heart, and shall try to give
 17147	him what consolation I can.â
 17148	
 17149	âWh-what is the matter?â asked both the young and old RostÃ³v.
 17150	
 17151	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna sighed deeply.
 17152	
 17153	âDÃ³lokhov, Mary IvÃ¡novnaâs son,â she said in a mysterious
 17154	whisper, âhas compromised her completely, they say. Pierre took him
 17155	up, invited him to his house in Petersburg, and now... she has come here
 17156	and that daredevil after her!â said Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, wishing to show
 17157	her sympathy for Pierre, but by involuntary intonations and a half smile
 17158	betraying her sympathy for the âdaredevil,â as she called DÃ³lokhov.
 17159	âThey say Pierre is quite broken by his misfortune.â
 17160	
 17161	âDear, dear! But still tell him to come to the clubâit will all blow
 17162	over. It will be a tremendous banquet.â
 17163	
 17164	Next day, the third of March, soon after one oâclock, two hundred and
 17165	fifty members of the English Club and fifty guests were awaiting the
 17166	guest of honor and hero of the Austrian campaign, Prince BagratiÃ³n, to
 17167	dinner.
 17168	
 17169	On the first arrival of the news of the battle of Austerlitz, Moscow had
 17170	been bewildered. At that time, the Russians were so used to victories
 17171	that on receiving news of the defeat some would simply not believe it,
 17172	while others sought some extraordinary explanation of so strange an
 17173	event. In the English Club, where all who were distinguished, important,
 17174	and well informed foregathered when the news began to arrive in
 17175	December, nothing was said about the war and the last battle, as
 17176	though all were in a conspiracy of silence. The men who set the tone
 17177	in conversationâCount RostopchÃ­n, Prince YÃºri DolgorÃºkov, ValÃºev,
 17178	Count MarkÃ³v, and Prince VyÃ¡zemskiâdid not show themselves at the
 17179	club, but met in private houses in intimate circles, and the
 17180	Moscovites who took their opinions from othersâIlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v among
 17181	themâremained for a while without any definite opinion on the subject
 17182	of the war and without leaders. The Moscovites felt that something was
 17183	wrong and that to discuss the bad news was difficult, and so it was best
 17184	to be silent. But after a while, just as a jury comes out of its room,
 17185	the bigwigs who guided the clubâs opinion reappeared, and everybody
 17186	began speaking clearly and definitely. Reasons were found for the
 17187	incredible, unheard-of, and impossible event of a Russian defeat,
 17188	everything became clear, and in all corners of Moscow the same things
 17189	began to be said. These reasons were the treachery of the Austrians, a
 17190	defective commissariat, the treachery of the Pole PrzebyszÃ©wski and of
 17191	the Frenchman Langeron, KutÃºzovâs incapacity, and (it was whispered)
 17192	the youth and inexperience of the sovereign, who had trusted worthless
 17193	and insignificant people. But the army, the Russian army, everyone
 17194	declared, was extraordinary and had achieved miracles of valor. The
 17195	soldiers, officers, and generals were heroes. But the hero of heroes was
 17196	Prince BagratiÃ³n, distinguished by his SchÃ¶n Grabern affair and by
 17197	the retreat from Austerlitz, where he alone had withdrawn his column
 17198	unbroken and had all day beaten back an enemy force twice as numerous
 17199	as his own. What also conduced to BagratiÃ³nâs being selected as
 17200	Moscowâs hero was the fact that he had no connections in the city
 17201	and was a stranger there. In his person, honor was shown to a simple
 17202	fighting Russian soldier without connections and intrigues, and to one
 17203	who was associated by memories of the Italian campaign with the name of
 17204	SuvÃ³rov. Moreover, paying such honor to BagratiÃ³n was the best way of
 17205	expressing disapproval and dislike of KutÃºzov.
 17206	
 17207	âHad there been no BagratiÃ³n, it would have been necessary to
 17208	invent him,â said the wit ShinshÃ­n, parodying the words of Voltaire.
 17209	KutÃºzov no one spoke of, except some who abused him in whispers,
 17210	calling him a court weathercock and an old satyr.
 17211	
 17212	All Moscow repeated Prince DolgorÃºkovâs saying: âIf you go on
 17213	modeling and modeling you must get smeared with clay,â suggesting
 17214	consolation for our defeat by the memory of former victories; and the
 17215	words of RostopchÃ­n, that French soldiers have to be incited to battle
 17216	by highfalutin words, and Germans by logical arguments to show them
 17217	that it is more dangerous to run away than to advance, but that Russian
 17218	soldiers only need to be restrained and held back! On all sides, new and
 17219	fresh anecdotes were heard of individual examples of heroism shown by
 17220	our officers and men at Austerlitz. One had saved a standard, another
 17221	had killed five Frenchmen, a third had loaded five cannon singlehanded.
 17222	Berg was mentioned, by those who did not know him, as having, when
 17223	wounded in the right hand, taken his sword in the left, and gone
 17224	forward. Of BolkÃ³nski, nothing was said, and only those who knew him
 17225	intimately regretted that he had died so young, leaving a pregnant wife
 17226	with his eccentric father.

 17232	CHAPTER III
 17233	
 17234	On that third of March, all the rooms in the English Club were filled
 17235	with a hum of conversation, like the hum of bees swarming in springtime.
 17236	The members and guests of the club wandered hither and thither, sat,
 17237	stood, met, and separated, some in uniform and some in evening dress,
 17238	and a few here and there with powdered hair and in Russian kaftÃ¡ns.
 17239	Powdered footmen, in livery with buckled shoes and smart stockings,
 17240	stood at every door anxiously noting visitorsâ every movement in order
 17241	to offer their services. Most of those present were elderly, respected
 17242	men with broad, self-confident faces, fat fingers, and resolute gestures
 17243	and voices. This class of guests and members sat in certain habitual
 17244	places and met in certain habitual groups. A minority of those present
 17245	were casual guestsâchiefly young men, among whom were DenÃ­sov,
 17246	RostÃ³v, and DÃ³lokhovâwho was now again an officer in the SemÃ«nov
 17247	regiment. The faces of these young people, especially those who were
 17248	military men, bore that expression of condescending respect for their
 17249	elders which seems to say to the older generation, âWe are prepared to
 17250	respect and honor you, but all the same remember that the future belongs
 17251	to us.â
 17252	
 17253	NesvÃ­tski was there as an old member of the club. Pierre, who at his
 17254	wifeâs command had let his hair grow and abandoned his spectacles,
 17255	went about the rooms fashionably dressed but looking sad and dull. Here,
 17256	as elsewhere, he was surrounded by an atmosphere of subservience to
 17257	his wealth, and being in the habit of lording it over these people, he
 17258	treated them with absent-minded contempt.
 17259	
 17260	By his age he should have belonged to the younger men, but by his wealth
 17261	and connections he belonged to the groups of old and honored guests, and
 17262	so he went from one group to another. Some of the most important old men
 17263	were the center of groups which even strangers approached respectfully
 17264	to hear the voices of well-known men. The largest circles formed round
 17265	Count RostopchÃ­n, ValÃºev, and NarÃ½shkin. RostopchÃ­n was describing
 17266	how the Russians had been overwhelmed by flying Austrians and had had to
 17267	force their way through them with bayonets.
 17268	
 17269	ValÃºev was confidentially telling that UvÃ¡rov had been sent from
 17270	Petersburg to ascertain what Moscow was thinking about Austerlitz.
 17271	
 17272	In the third circle, NarÃ½shkin was speaking of the meeting of the
 17273	Austrian Council of War at which SuvÃ³rov crowed like a cock in reply to
 17274	the nonsense talked by the Austrian generals. ShinshÃ­n, standing close
 17275	by, tried to make a joke, saying that KutÃºzov had evidently failed to
 17276	learn from SuvÃ³rov even so simple a thing as the art of crowing like a
 17277	cock, but the elder members glanced severely at the wit, making him
 17278	feel that in that place and on that day, it was improper to speak so of
 17279	KutÃºzov.
 17280	
 17281	Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v, hurried and preoccupied, went about in his soft
 17282	boots between the dining and drawing rooms, hastily greeting the
 17283	important and unimportant, all of whom he knew, as if they were all
 17284	equals, while his eyes occasionally sought out his fine well-set-up
 17285	young son, resting on him and winking joyfully at him. Young RostÃ³v
 17286	stood at a window with DÃ³lokhov, whose acquaintance he had lately
 17287	made and highly valued. The old count came up to them and pressed
 17288	DÃ³lokhovâs hand.
 17289	
 17290	âPlease come and visit us... you know my brave boy... been together
 17291	out there... both playing the hero... Ah, VasÃ­li IgnÃ¡tovich...
 17292	How dâye do, old fellow?â he said, turning to an old man who was
 17293	passing, but before he had finished his greeting there was a general
 17294	stir, and a footman who had run in announced, with a frightened face:
 17295	âHeâs arrived!â
 17296	
 17297	Bells rang, the stewards rushed forward, andâlike rye shaken together
 17298	in a shovelâthe guests who had been scattered about in different rooms
 17299	came together and crowded in the large drawing room by the door of the
 17300	ballroom.
 17301	
 17302	BagratiÃ³n appeared in the doorway of the anteroom without hat or sword,
 17303	which, in accord with the club custom, he had given up to the hall
 17304	porter. He had no lambskin cap on his head, nor had he a loaded whip
 17305	over his shoulder, as when RostÃ³v had seen him on the eve of the battle
 17306	of Austerlitz, but wore a tight new uniform with Russian and foreign
 17307	Orders, and the Star of St. George on his left breast. Evidently just
 17308	before coming to the dinner he had had his hair and whiskers trimmed,
 17309	which changed his appearance for the worse. There was something naÃ¯vely
 17310	festive in his air, which, in conjunction with his firm and virile
 17311	features, gave him a rather comical expression. BekleshÃ«v and Theodore
 17312	UvÃ¡rov, who had arrived with him, paused at the doorway to allow him,
 17313	as the guest of honor, to enter first. BagratiÃ³n was embarrassed, not
 17314	wishing to avail himself of their courtesy, and this caused some delay
 17315	at the doors, but after all he did at last enter first. He walked shyly
 17316	and awkwardly over the parquet floor of the reception room, not knowing
 17317	what to do with his hands; he was more accustomed to walk over a plowed
 17318	field under fire, as he had done at the head of the Kursk regiment at
 17319	SchÃ¶n Grabernâand he would have found that easier. The committeemen
 17320	met him at the first door and, expressing their delight at seeing such a
 17321	highly honored guest, took possession of him as it were, without waiting
 17322	for his reply, surrounded him, and led him to the drawing room. It was
 17323	at first impossible to enter the drawing room door for the crowd of
 17324	members and guests jostling one another and trying to get a good look
 17325	at BagratiÃ³n over each otherâs shoulders, as if he were some rare
 17326	animal. Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v, laughing and repeating the words, âMake
 17327	way, dear boy! Make way, make way!â pushed through the crowd more
 17328	energetically than anyone, led the guests into the drawing room, and
 17329	seated them on the center sofa. The bigwigs, the most respected members
 17330	of the club, beset the new arrivals. Count IlyÃ¡, again thrusting his
 17331	way through the crowd, went out of the drawing room and reappeared a
 17332	minute later with another committeeman, carrying a large silver salver
 17333	which he presented to Prince BagratiÃ³n. On the salver lay some verses
 17334	composed and printed in the heroâs honor. BagratiÃ³n, on seeing the
 17335	salver, glanced around in dismay, as though seeking help. But all eyes
 17336	demanded that he should submit. Feeling himself in their power, he
 17337	resolutely took the salver with both hands and looked sternly and
 17338	reproachfully at the count who had presented it to him. Someone
 17339	obligingly took the dish from BagratiÃ³n (or he would, it seemed, have
 17340	held it till evening and have gone in to dinner with it) and drew his
 17341	attention to the verses.
 17342	
 17343	âWell, I will read them, then!â BagratiÃ³n seemed to say, and,
 17344	fixing his weary eyes on the paper, began to read them with a fixed and
 17345	serious expression. But the author himself took the verses and began
 17346	reading them aloud. BagratiÃ³n bowed his head and listened:
 17347	
 17348	   Bring glory then to Alexanderâs reign
 17349	   And on the throne our Titus shield.
 17350	   A dreaded foe be thou, kindhearted as a man,
 17351	   A Rhipheus at home, a Caesar in the field!
 17352	   Eâen fortunate Napoleon
 17353	   Knows by experience, now, BagratiÃ³n,
 17354	   And dare not Herculean Russians trouble...
 17355	
 17356	But before he had finished reading, a stentorian major-domo announced
 17357	that dinner was ready! The door opened, and from the dining room came
 17358	the resounding strains of the polonaise:
 17359	
 17360	   Conquestâs joyful thunder waken,
 17361	   Triumph, valiant Russians, now!...
 17362	
 17363	and Count RostÃ³v, glancing angrily at the author who went on reading
 17364	his verses, bowed to BagratiÃ³n. Everyone rose, feeling that dinner
 17365	was more important than verses, and BagratiÃ³n, again preceding all the
 17366	rest, went in to dinner. He was seated in the place of honor between
 17367	two AlexandersâBekleshÃ«v and NarÃ½shkinâwhich was a significant
 17368	allusion to the name of the sovereign. Three hundred persons took their
 17369	seats in the dining room, according to their rank and importance: the
 17370	more important nearer to the honored guest, as naturally as water flows
 17371	deepest where the land lies lowest.
 17372	
 17373	Just before dinner, Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v presented his son to BagratiÃ³n,
 17374	who recognized him and said a few words to him, disjointed and awkward,
 17375	as were all the words he spoke that day, and Count IlyÃ¡ looked joyfully
 17376	and proudly around while BagratiÃ³n spoke to his son.
 17377	
 17378	Nicholas RostÃ³v, with DenÃ­sov and his new acquaintance, DÃ³lokhov, sat
 17379	almost at the middle of the table. Facing them sat Pierre, beside Prince
 17380	NesvÃ­tski. Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v with the other members of the committee
 17381	sat facing BagratiÃ³n and, as the very personification of Moscow
 17382	hospitality, did the honors to the prince.
 17383	
 17384	His efforts had not been in vain. The dinner, both the Lenten and the
 17385	other fare, was splendid, yet he could not feel quite at ease till the
 17386	end of the meal. He winked at the butler, whispered directions to the
 17387	footmen, and awaited each expected dish with some anxiety. Everything
 17388	was excellent. With the second course, a gigantic sterlet (at sight of
 17389	which IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v blushed with self-conscious pleasure), the footmen
 17390	began popping corks and filling the champagne glasses. After the fish,
 17391	which made a certain sensation, the count exchanged glances with
 17392	the other committeemen. âThere will be many toasts, itâs time to
 17393	begin,â he whispered, and taking up his glass, he rose. All were
 17394	silent, waiting for what he would say.
 17395	
 17396	âTo the health of our Sovereign, the Emperor!â he cried, and at the
 17397	same moment his kindly eyes grew moist with tears of joy and enthusiasm.
 17398	The band immediately struck up âConquestâs joyful thunder
 17399	waken...â All rose and cried âHurrah!â BagratiÃ³n also rose and
 17400	shouted âHurrah!â in exactly the same voice in which he had shouted
 17401	it on the field at SchÃ¶n Grabern. Young RostÃ³vâs ecstatic voice
 17402	could be heard above the three hundred others. He nearly wept. âTo the
 17403	health of our Sovereign, the Emperor!â he roared, âHurrah!â and
 17404	emptying his glass at one gulp he dashed it to the floor. Many followed
 17405	his example, and the loud shouting continued for a long time. When the
 17406	voices subsided, the footmen cleared away the broken glass and everybody
 17407	sat down again, smiling at the noise they had made and exchanging
 17408	remarks. The old count rose once more, glanced at a note lying beside
 17409	his plate, and proposed a toast, âTo the health of the hero of our
 17410	last campaign, Prince Peter IvÃ¡novich BagratiÃ³n!â and again his blue
 17411	eyes grew moist. âHurrah!â cried the three hundred voices again,
 17412	but instead of the band a choir began singing a cantata composed by Paul
 17413	IvÃ¡novich KutÃºzov:
 17414	
 17415	   Russians! Oâer all barriers on!
 17416	   Courage conquest guarantees;
 17417	   Have we not BagratiÃ³n?
 17418	   He brings foemen to their knees,... etc.
 17419	
 17420	As soon as the singing was over, another and another toast was proposed
 17421	and Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v became more and more moved, more glass was
 17422	smashed, and the shouting grew louder. They drank to BekleshÃ«v,
 17423	NarÃ½shkin, UvÃ¡rov, DolgorÃºkov, AprÃ¡ksin, ValÃºev, to the committee,
 17424	to all the club members and to all the club guests, and finally to
 17425	Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v separately, as the organizer of the banquet. At that
 17426	toast, the count took out his handkerchief and, covering his face, wept
 17427	outright.
 17428	
 17429	
 17430	
 17431	
 17432	
 17433	CHAPTER IV
 17434	
 17435	Pierre sat opposite DÃ³lokhov and Nicholas RostÃ³v. As usual, he ate and
 17436	drank much, and eagerly. But those who knew him intimately noticed that
 17437	some great change had come over him that day. He was silent all through
 17438	dinner and looked about, blinking and scowling, or, with fixed eyes and
 17439	a look of complete absent-mindedness, kept rubbing the bridge of his
 17440	nose. His face was depressed and gloomy. He seemed to see and hear
 17441	nothing of what was going on around him and to be absorbed by some
 17442	depressing and unsolved problem.
 17443	
 17444	The unsolved problem that tormented him was caused by hints given by the
 17445	princess, his cousin, at Moscow, concerning DÃ³lokhovâs intimacy with
 17446	his wife, and by an anonymous letter he had received that morning, which
 17447	in the mean jocular way common to anonymous letters said that he saw
 17448	badly through his spectacles, but that his wifeâs connection with
 17449	DÃ³lokhov was a secret to no one but himself. Pierre absolutely
 17450	disbelieved both the princessâ hints and the letter, but he feared
 17451	now to look at DÃ³lokhov, who was sitting opposite him. Every time
 17452	he chanced to meet DÃ³lokhovâs handsome insolent eyes, Pierre felt
 17453	something terrible and monstrous rising in his soul and turned quickly
 17454	away. Involuntarily recalling his wifeâs past and her relations with
 17455	DÃ³lokhov, Pierre saw clearly that what was said in the letter might be
 17456	true, or might at least seem to be true had it not referred to his wife.
 17457	He involuntarily remembered how DÃ³lokhov, who had fully recovered his
 17458	former position after the campaign, had returned to Petersburg and come
 17459	to him. Availing himself of his friendly relations with Pierre as a boon
 17460	companion, DÃ³lokhov had come straight to his house, and Pierre had put
 17461	him up and lent him money. Pierre recalled how HÃ©lÃ¨ne had smilingly
 17462	expressed disapproval of DÃ³lokhovâs living at their house, and how
 17463	cynically DÃ³lokhov had praised his wifeâs beauty to him and from that
 17464	time till they came to Moscow had not left them for a day.
 17465	
 17466	âYes, he is very handsome,â thought Pierre, âand I know him. It
 17467	would be particularly pleasant to him to dishonor my name and ridicule
 17468	me, just because I have exerted myself on his behalf, befriended him,
 17469	and helped him. I know and understand what a spice that would add to the
 17470	pleasure of deceiving me, if it really were true. Yes, if it were true,
 17471	but I do not believe it. I have no right to, and canât, believe it.â
 17472	He remembered the expression DÃ³lokhovâs face assumed in his moments
 17473	of cruelty, as when tying the policeman to the bear and dropping them
 17474	into the water, or when he challenged a man to a duel without any
 17475	reason, or shot a post-boyâs horse with a pistol. That expression
 17476	was often on DÃ³lokhovâs face when looking at him. âYes, he is a
 17477	bully,â thought Pierre, âto kill a man means nothing to him. It must
 17478	seem to him that everyone is afraid of him, and that must please him.
 17479	He must think that I, too, am afraid of himâand in fact I am afraid of
 17480	him,â he thought, and again he felt something terrible and monstrous
 17481	rising in his soul. DÃ³lokhov, DenÃ­sov, and RostÃ³v were now sitting
 17482	opposite Pierre and seemed very gay. RostÃ³v was talking merrily to his
 17483	two friends, one of whom was a dashing hussar and the other a notorious
 17484	duelist and rake, and every now and then he glanced ironically at
 17485	Pierre, whose preoccupied, absent-minded, and massive figure was a very
 17486	noticeable one at the dinner. RostÃ³v looked inimically at Pierre,
 17487	first because Pierre appeared to his hussar eyes as a rich civilian, the
 17488	husband of a beauty, and in a wordâan old woman; and secondly because
 17489	Pierre in his preoccupation and absent-mindedness had not recognized
 17490	RostÃ³v and had not responded to his greeting. When the Emperorâs
 17491	health was drunk, Pierre, lost in thought, did not rise or lift his
 17492	glass.
 17493	
 17494	âWhat are you about?â shouted RostÃ³v, looking at him in an ecstasy
 17495	of exasperation. âDonât you hear itâs His Majesty the Emperorâs
 17496	health?â
 17497	
 17498	Pierre sighed, rose submissively, emptied his glass, and, waiting till
 17499	all were seated again, turned with his kindly smile to RostÃ³v.
 17500	
 17501	âWhy, I didnât recognize you!â he said. But RostÃ³v was otherwise
 17502	engaged; he was shouting âHurrah!â
 17503	
 17504	âWhy donât you renew the acquaintance?â said DÃ³lokhov to RostÃ³v.
 17505	
 17506	âConfound him, heâs a fool!â said RostÃ³v.
 17507	
 17508	âOne should make up to the husbands of pretty women,â said DenÃ­sov.
 17509	
 17510	Pierre did not catch what they were saying, but knew they were talking
 17511	about him. He reddened and turned away.
 17512	
 17513	âWell, now to the health of handsome women!â said DÃ³lokhov, and
 17514	with a serious expression, but with a smile lurking at the corners of
 17515	his mouth, he turned with his glass to Pierre.
 17516	
 17517	âHereâs to the health of lovely women, Peterkinâand their
 17518	lovers!â he added.
 17519	
 17520	Pierre, with downcast eyes, drank out of his glass without looking at
 17521	DÃ³lokhov or answering him. The footman, who was distributing leaflets
 17522	with KutÃºzovâs cantata, laid one before Pierre as one of the
 17523	principal guests. He was just going to take it when DÃ³lokhov, leaning
 17524	across, snatched it from his hand and began reading it. Pierre looked
 17525	at DÃ³lokhov and his eyes dropped, the something terrible and monstrous
 17526	that had tormented him all dinnertime rose and took possession of him.
 17527	He leaned his whole massive body across the table.
 17528	
 17529	âHow dare you take it?â he shouted.
 17530	
 17531	Hearing that cry and seeing to whom it was addressed, NesvÃ­tski and the
 17532	neighbor on his right quickly turned in alarm to BezÃºkhov.
 17533	
 17534	âDonât! Donât! What are you about?â whispered their frightened
 17535	voices.
 17536	
 17537	DÃ³lokhov looked at Pierre with clear, mirthful, cruel eyes, and that
 17538	smile of his which seemed to say, âAh! This is what I like!â
 17539	
 17540	âYou shanât have it!â he said distinctly.
 17541	
 17542	Pale, with quivering lips, Pierre snatched the copy.
 17543	
 17544	âYou...! you... scoundrel! I challenge you!â he ejaculated, and,
 17545	pushing back his chair, he rose from the table.
 17546	
 17547	At the very instant he did this and uttered those words, Pierre felt
 17548	that the question of his wifeâs guilt which had been tormenting him
 17549	the whole day was finally and indubitably answered in the affirmative.
 17550	He hated her and was forever sundered from her. Despite DenÃ­sovâs
 17551	request that he would take no part in the matter, RostÃ³v agreed to be
 17552	DÃ³lokhovâs second, and after dinner he discussed the arrangements for
 17553	the duel with NesvÃ­tski, BezÃºkhovâs second. Pierre went home, but
 17554	RostÃ³v with DÃ³lokhov and DenÃ­sov stayed on at the club till late,
 17555	listening to the gypsies and other singers.
 17556	
 17557	âWell then, till tomorrow at SokÃ³lniki,â said DÃ³lokhov, as he took
 17558	leave of RostÃ³v in the club porch.
 17559	
 17560	âAnd do you feel quite calm?â RostÃ³v asked.
 17561	
 17562	DÃ³lokhov paused.
 17563	
 17564	âWell, you see, Iâll tell you the whole secret of dueling in two
 17565	words. If you are going to fight a duel, and you make a will and write
 17566	affectionate letters to your parents, and if you think you may be
 17567	killed, you are a fool and are lost for certain. But go with the firm
 17568	intention of killing your man as quickly and surely as possible, and
 17569	then all will be right, as our bear huntsman at KostromÃ¡ used to tell
 17570	me. âEveryone fears a bear,â he says, âbut when you see one your
 17571	fearâs all gone, and your only thought is not to let him get away!â
 17572	And thatâs how it is with me. Ã demain, mon cher.â *
 17573	
 17574	    * Till tomorrow, my dear fellow.
 17575	
 17576	Next day, at eight in the morning, Pierre and NesvÃ­tski drove to the
 17577	SokÃ³lniki forest and found DÃ³lokhov, DenÃ­sov, and RostÃ³v already
 17578	there. Pierre had the air of a man preoccupied with considerations which
 17579	had no connection with the matter in hand. His haggard face was yellow.
 17580	He had evidently not slept that night. He looked about distractedly and
 17581	screwed up his eyes as if dazzled by the sun. He was entirely absorbed
 17582	by two considerations: his wifeâs guilt, of which after his sleepless
 17583	night he had not the slightest doubt, and the guiltlessness of
 17584	DÃ³lokhov, who had no reason to preserve the honor of a man who was
 17585	nothing to him.... âI should perhaps have done the same thing in his
 17586	place,â thought Pierre. âItâs even certain that I should have done
 17587	the same, then why this duel, this murder? Either I shall kill him, or
 17588	he will hit me in the head, or elbow, or knee. Canât I go away from
 17589	here, run away, bury myself somewhere?â passed through his mind. But
 17590	just at moments when such thoughts occurred to him, he would ask in a
 17591	particularly calm and absent-minded way, which inspired the respect of
 17592	the onlookers, âWill it be long? Are things ready?â
 17593	
 17594	When all was ready, the sabers stuck in the snow to mark the barriers,
 17595	and the pistols loaded, NesvÃ­tski went up to Pierre.
 17596	
 17597	âI should not be doing my duty, Count,â he said in timid tones,
 17598	âand should not justify your confidence and the honor you have done
 17599	me in choosing me for your second, if at this grave, this very
 17600	grave, moment I did not tell you the whole truth. I think there is no
 17601	sufficient ground for this affair, or for blood to be shed over it....
 17602	You were not right, not quite in the right, you were impetuous...â
 17603	
 17604	âOh yes, it is horribly stupid,â said Pierre.
 17605	
 17606	âThen allow me to express your regrets, and I am sure your opponent
 17607	will accept them,â said NesvÃ­tski (who like the others concerned in
 17608	the affair, and like everyone in similar cases, did not yet believe that
 17609	the affair had come to an actual duel). âYou know, Count, it is much
 17610	more honorable to admit oneâs mistake than to let matters become
 17611	irreparable. There was no insult on either side. Allow me to
 17612	convey....â
 17613	
 17614	âNo! What is there to talk about?â said Pierre. âItâs all the
 17615	same.... Is everything ready?â he added. âOnly tell me where to go
 17616	and where to shoot,â he said with an unnaturally gentle smile.
 17617	
 17618	He took the pistol in his hand and began asking about the working of the
 17619	trigger, as he had not before held a pistol in his handâa fact that he
 17620	did not wish to confess.
 17621	
 17622	âOh yes, like that, I know, I only forgot,â said he.
 17623	
 17624	âNo apologies, none whatever,â said DÃ³lokhov to DenÃ­sov (who on
 17625	his side had been attempting a reconciliation), and he also went up to
 17626	the appointed place.
 17627	
 17628	The spot chosen for the duel was some eighty paces from the road,
 17629	where the sleighs had been left, in a small clearing in the pine forest
 17630	covered with melting snow, the frost having begun to break up during the
 17631	last few days. The antagonists stood forty paces apart at the farther
 17632	edge of the clearing. The seconds, measuring the paces, left tracks in
 17633	the deep wet snow between the place where they had been standing and
 17634	NesvÃ­tskiâs and DÃ³lokhovâs sabers, which were stuck into the
 17635	ground ten paces apart to mark the barrier. It was thawing and misty; at
 17636	forty pacesâ distance nothing could be seen. For three minutes all had
 17637	been ready, but they still delayed and all were silent.
 17638	
 17639	
 17640	
 17641	
 17642	
 17643	CHAPTER V
 17644	
 17645	âWell begin!â said DÃ³lokhov.
 17646	
 17647	âAll right,â said Pierre, still smiling in the same way. A feeling
 17648	of dread was in the air. It was evident that the affair so lightly begun
 17649	could no longer be averted but was taking its course independently of
 17650	menâs will.
 17651	
 17652	DenÃ­sov first went to the barrier and announced: âAs the
 17653	adveâsawies have wefused a weconciliation, please pwoceed. Take your
 17654	pistols, and at the word thwee begin to advance.
 17655	
 17656	âO-ne! T-wo! Thwee!â he shouted angrily and stepped aside.
 17657	
 17658	The combatants advanced along the trodden tracks, nearer and nearer to
 17659	one another, beginning to see one another through the mist. They had the
 17660	right to fire when they liked as they approached the barrier. DÃ³lokhov
 17661	walked slowly without raising his pistol, looking intently with his
 17662	bright, sparkling blue eyes into his antagonistâs face. His mouth wore
 17663	its usual semblance of a smile.
 17664	
 17665	âSo I can fire when I like!â said Pierre, and at the word
 17666	âthree,â he went quickly forward, missing the trodden path and
 17667	stepping into the deep snow. He held the pistol in his right hand at
 17668	armâs length, apparently afraid of shooting himself with it. His left
 17669	hand he held carefully back, because he wished to support his right
 17670	hand with it and knew he must not do so. Having advanced six paces and
 17671	strayed off the track into the snow, Pierre looked down at his feet,
 17672	then quickly glanced at DÃ³lokhov and, bending his finger as he had been
 17673	shown, fired. Not at all expecting so loud a report, Pierre shuddered
 17674	at the sound and then, smiling at his own sensations, stood still. The
 17675	smoke, rendered denser by the mist, prevented him from seeing anything
 17676	for an instant, but there was no second report as he had expected. He
 17677	only heard DÃ³lokhovâs hurried steps, and his figure came in view
 17678	through the smoke. He was pressing one hand to his left side, while
 17679	the other clutched his drooping pistol. His face was pale. RostÃ³v ran
 17680	toward him and said something.
 17681	
 17682	âNo-o-o!â muttered DÃ³lokhov through his teeth, âno, itâs not
 17683	over.â And after stumbling a few staggering steps right up to the
 17684	saber, he sank on the snow beside it. His left hand was bloody; he wiped
 17685	it on his coat and supported himself with it. His frowning face was
 17686	pallid and quivered.
 17687	
 17688	âPlea...â began DÃ³lokhov, but could not at first pronounce the
 17689	word.
 17690	
 17691	âPlease,â he uttered with an effort.
 17692	
 17693	Pierre, hardly restraining his sobs, began running toward DÃ³lokhov and
 17694	was about to cross the space between the barriers, when DÃ³lokhov cried:
 17695	
 17696	âTo your barrier!â and Pierre, grasping what was meant, stopped by
 17697	his saber. Only ten paces divided them. DÃ³lokhov lowered his head to
 17698	the snow, greedily bit at it, again raised his head, adjusted himself,
 17699	drew in his legs and sat up, seeking a firm center of gravity. He sucked
 17700	and swallowed the cold snow, his lips quivered but his eyes, still
 17701	smiling, glittered with effort and exasperation as he mustered his
 17702	remaining strength. He raised his pistol and aimed.
 17703	
 17704	âSideways! Cover yourself with your pistol!â ejaculated NesvÃ­tski.
 17705	
 17706	âCover yourself!â even DenÃ­sov cried to his adversary.
 17707	
 17708	Pierre, with a gentle smile of pity and remorse, his arms and legs
 17709	helplessly spread out, stood with his broad chest directly facing
 17710	DÃ³lokhov and looked sorrowfully at him. DenÃ­sov, RostÃ³v, and
 17711	NesvÃ­tski closed their eyes. At the same instant they heard a report
 17712	and DÃ³lokhovâs angry cry.
 17713	
 17714	âMissed!â shouted DÃ³lokhov, and he lay helplessly, face downwards
 17715	on the snow.
 17716	
 17717	Pierre clutched his temples, and turning round went into the forest,
 17718	trampling through the deep snow, and muttering incoherent words:
 17719	
 17720	âFolly... folly! Death... lies...â he repeated, puckering his face.
 17721	
 17722	NesvÃ­tski stopped him and took him home.
 17723	
 17724	RostÃ³v and DenÃ­sov drove away with the wounded DÃ³lokhov.
 17725	
 17726	The latter lay silent in the sleigh with closed eyes and did not answer
 17727	a word to the questions addressed to him. But on entering Moscow he
 17728	suddenly came to and, lifting his head with an effort, took RostÃ³v, who
 17729	was sitting beside him, by the hand. RostÃ³v was struck by the
 17730	totally altered and unexpectedly rapturous and tender expression on
 17731	DÃ³lokhovâs face.
 17732	
 17733	âWell? How do you feel?â he asked.
 17734	
 17735	âBad! But itâs not that, my friendââ said DÃ³lokhov with a
 17736	gasping voice. âWhere are we? In Moscow, I know. I donât matter,
 17737	but I have killed her, killed... She wonât get over it! She wonât
 17738	survive....â
 17739	
 17740	âWho?â asked RostÃ³v.
 17741	
 17742	âMy mother! My mother, my angel, my adored angel mother,â and
 17743	DÃ³lokhov pressed RostÃ³vâs hand and burst into tears.
 17744	
 17745	When he had become a little quieter, he explained to RostÃ³v that he was
 17746	living with his mother, who, if she saw him dying, would not survive it.
 17747	He implored RostÃ³v to go on and prepare her.
 17748	
 17749	RostÃ³v went on ahead to do what was asked, and to his great surprise
 17750	learned that DÃ³lokhov the brawler, DÃ³lokhov the bully, lived in Moscow
 17751	with an old mother and a hunchback sister, and was the most affectionate
 17752	of sons and brothers.
 17753	
 17754	
 17755	
 17756	
 17757	
 17758	CHAPTER VI
 17759	
 17760	Pierre had of late rarely seen his wife alone. Both in Petersburg and in
 17761	Moscow their house was always full of visitors. The night after the
 17762	duel he did not go to his bedroom but, as he often did, remained in his
 17763	fatherâs room, that huge room in which Count BezÃºkhov had died.
 17764	
 17765	He lay down on the sofa meaning to fall asleep and forget all that
 17766	had happened to him, but could not do so. Such a storm of feelings,
 17767	thoughts, and memories suddenly arose within him that he could not fall
 17768	asleep, nor even remain in one place, but had to jump up and pace the
 17769	room with rapid steps. Now he seemed to see her in the early days of
 17770	their marriage, with bare shoulders and a languid, passionate look on
 17771	her face, and then immediately he saw beside her DÃ³lokhovâs handsome,
 17772	insolent, hard, and mocking face as he had seen it at the banquet, and
 17773	then that same face pale, quivering, and suffering, as it had been when
 17774	he reeled and sank on the snow.
 17775	
 17776	âWhat has happened?â he asked himself. âI have killed her lover,
 17777	yes, killed my wifeâs lover. Yes, that was it! And why? How did I come
 17778	to do it?âââBecause you married her,â answered an inner voice.
 17779	
 17780	âBut in what was I to blame?â he asked. âIn marrying her without
 17781	loving her; in deceiving yourself and her.â And he vividly recalled
 17782	that moment after supper at Prince VasÃ­liâs, when he spoke those
 17783	words he had found so difficult to utter: âI love you.â âIt all
 17784	comes from that! Even then I felt it,â he thought. âI felt then that
 17785	it was not so, that I had no right to do it. And so it turns out.â
 17786	
 17787	He remembered his honeymoon and blushed at the recollection.
 17788	Particularly vivid, humiliating, and shameful was the recollection of
 17789	how one day soon after his marriage he came out of the bedroom into his
 17790	study a little before noon in his silk dressing gown and found his head
 17791	steward there, who, bowing respectfully, looked into his face and at
 17792	his dressing gown and smiled slightly, as if expressing respectful
 17793	understanding of his employerâs happiness.
 17794	
 17795	âBut how often I have felt proud of her, proud of her majestic beauty
 17796	and social tact,â thought he; âbeen proud of my house, in which she
 17797	received all Petersburg, proud of her unapproachability and beauty. So
 17798	this is what I was proud of! I then thought that I did not understand
 17799	her. How often when considering her character I have told myself that
 17800	I was to blame for not understanding her, for not understanding that
 17801	constant composure and complacency and lack of all interests or desires,
 17802	and the whole secret lies in the terrible truth that she is a depraved
 17803	woman. Now I have spoken that terrible word to myself all has become
 17804	clear.
 17805	
 17806	âAnatole used to come to borrow money from her and used to kiss her
 17807	naked shoulders. She did not give him the money, but let herself be
 17808	kissed. Her father in jest tried to rouse her jealousy, and she replied
 17809	with a calm smile that she was not so stupid as to be jealous: âLet
 17810	him do what he pleases,â she used to say of me. One day I asked her if
 17811	she felt any symptoms of pregnancy. She laughed contemptuously and said
 17812	she was not a fool to want to have children, and that she was not going
 17813	to have any children by me.â
 17814	
 17815	Then he recalled the coarseness and bluntness of her thoughts and the
 17816	vulgarity of the expressions that were natural to her, though she had
 17817	been brought up in the most aristocratic circles.
 17818	
 17819	âIâm not such a fool.... Just you try it on.... Allez-vous
 17820	promener,â * she used to say. Often seeing the success she had with
 17821	young and old men and women Pierre could not understand why he did not
 17822	love her.
 17823	
 17824	    * âYou clear out of this.â
 17825	
 17826	
 17827	âYes, I never loved her,â said he to himself; âI knew she was a
 17828	depraved woman,â he repeated, âbut dared not admit it to myself.
 17829	And now thereâs DÃ³lokhov sitting in the snow with a forced smile and
 17830	perhaps dying, while meeting my remorse with some forced bravado!â
 17831	
 17832	Pierre was one of those people who, in spite of an appearance of what
 17833	is called weak character, do not seek a confidant in their troubles. He
 17834	digested his sufferings alone.
 17835	
 17836	âIt is all, all her fault,â he said to himself; âbut what of that?
 17837	Why did I bind myself to her? Why did I say âJe vous aimeâ * to her,
 17838	which was a lie, and worse than a lie? I am guilty and must endure...
 17839	what? A slur on my name? A misfortune for life? Oh, thatâs
 17840	nonsense,â he thought. âThe slur on my name and honorâthatâs all
 17841	apart from myself.â
 17842	
 17843	    * I love you.
 17844	
 17845	âLouis XVI was executed because they said he was dishonorable and a
 17846	criminal,â came into Pierreâs head, âand from their point of
 17847	view they were right, as were those too who canonized him and died a
 17848	martyrâs death for his sake. Then Robespierre was beheaded for being
 17849	a despot. Who is right and who is wrong? No one! But if you are
 17850	aliveâlive: tomorrow youâll die as I might have died an hour ago.
 17851	And is it worth tormenting oneself, when one has only a moment of life
 17852	in comparison with eternity?â
 17853	
 17854	But at the moment when he imagined himself calmed by such reflections,
 17855	she suddenly came into his mind as she was at the moments when he had
 17856	most strongly expressed his insincere love for her, and he felt the
 17857	blood rush to his heart and had again to get up and move about and break
 17858	and tear whatever came to his hand. âWhy did I tell her that âJe
 17859	vous aimeâ?â he kept repeating to himself. And when he had said it
 17860	for the tenth time, MoliÃ¨reâs words: âMais que diable allait-il
 17861	faire dans cette galÃ¨re?â * occurred to him, and he began to laugh at
 17862	himself.
 17863	
 17864	      * âBut what the devil was he doing in that galley?â
 17865	
 17866	
 17867	In the night he called his valet and told him to pack up to go to
 17868	Petersburg. He could not imagine how he could speak to her now. He
 17869	resolved to go away next day and leave a letter informing her of his
 17870	intention to part from her forever.
 17871	
 17872	Next morning when the valet came into the room with his coffee, Pierre
 17873	was lying asleep on the ottoman with an open book in his hand.
 17874	
 17875	He woke up and looked round for a while with a startled expression,
 17876	unable to realize where he was.
 17877	
 17878	âThe countess told me to inquire whether your excellency was at
 17879	home,â said the valet.
 17880	
 17881	But before Pierre could decide what answer he would send, the countess
 17882	herself in a white satin dressing gown embroidered with silver and with
 17883	simply dressed hair (two immense plaits twice round her lovely head like
 17884	a coronet) entered the room, calm and majestic, except that there was
 17885	a wrathful wrinkle on her rather prominent marble brow. With her
 17886	imperturbable calm she did not begin to speak in front of the valet.
 17887	She knew of the duel and had come to speak about it. She waited till the
 17888	valet had set down the coffee things and left the room. Pierre looked
 17889	at her timidly over his spectacles, and like a hare surrounded by hounds
 17890	who lays back her ears and continues to crouch motionless before her
 17891	enemies, he tried to continue reading. But feeling this to be senseless
 17892	and impossible, he again glanced timidly at her. She did not sit down
 17893	but looked at him with a contemptuous smile, waiting for the valet to
 17894	go.
 17895	
 17896	âWell, whatâs this now? What have you been up to now, I should like
 17897	to know?â she asked sternly.
 17898	
 17899	âI? What have I...?â stammered Pierre.
 17900	
 17901	âSo it seems youâre a hero, eh? Come now, what was this duel about?
 17902	What is it meant to prove? What? I ask you.â
 17903	
 17904	Pierre turned over heavily on the ottoman and opened his mouth, but
 17905	could not reply.
 17906	
 17907	âIf you wonât answer, Iâll tell you...â HÃ©lÃ¨ne went on. âYou
 17908	believe everything youâre told. You were told...â HÃ©lÃ¨ne laughed,
 17909	âthat DÃ³lokhov was my lover,â she said in French with her coarse
 17910	plainness of speech, uttering the word amant as casually as any other
 17911	word, âand you believed it! Well, what have you proved? What does this
 17912	duel prove? That youâre a fool, que vous Ãªtes un sot, but everybody
 17913	knew that. What will be the result? That I shall be the laughingstock of
 17914	all Moscow, that everyone will say that you, drunk and not knowing what
 17915	you were about, challenged a man you are jealous of without cause.â
 17916	HÃ©lÃ¨ne raised her voice and became more and more excited, âA man
 17917	whoâs a better man than you in every way...â
 17918	
 17919	âHm... Hm...!â growled Pierre, frowning without looking at her, and
 17920	not moving a muscle.
 17921	
 17922	âAnd how could you believe he was my lover? Why? Because I like
 17923	his company? If you were cleverer and more agreeable, I should prefer
 17924	yours.â
 17925	
 17926	âDonât speak to me... I beg you,â muttered Pierre hoarsely.
 17927	
 17928	âWhy shouldnât I speak? I can speak as I like, and I tell you
 17929	plainly that there are not many wives with husbands such as you who
 17930	would not have taken lovers (des amants), but I have not done so,â
 17931	said she.
 17932	
 17933	Pierre wished to say something, looked at her with eyes whose strange
 17934	expression she did not understand, and lay down again. He was suffering
 17935	physically at that moment, there was a weight on his chest and he could
 17936	not breathe. He knew that he must do something to put an end to this
 17937	suffering, but what he wanted to do was too terrible.
 17938	
 17939	âWe had better separate,â he muttered in a broken voice.
 17940	
 17941	âSeparate? Very well, but only if you give me a fortune,â said
 17942	HÃ©lÃ¨ne. âSeparate! Thatâs a thing to frighten me with!â
 17943	
 17944	Pierre leaped up from the sofa and rushed staggering toward her.
 17945	
 17946	âIâll kill you!â he shouted, and seizing the marble top of a table
 17947	with a strength he had never before felt, he made a step toward her
 17948	brandishing the slab.
 17949	
 17950	HÃ©lÃ¨neâs face became terrible, she shrieked and sprang aside. His
 17951	fatherâs nature showed itself in Pierre. He felt the fascination and
 17952	delight of frenzy. He flung down the slab, broke it, and swooping
 17953	down on her with outstretched hands shouted, âGet out!â in such a
 17954	terrible voice that the whole house heard it with horror. God knows what
 17955	he would have done at that moment had HÃ©lÃ¨ne not fled from the room.
 17956	
 17957	
 17958	A week later Pierre gave his wife full power to control all his estates
 17959	in Great Russia, which formed the larger part of his property, and left
 17960	for Petersburg alone.
 17961

 17966	CHAPTER VII
 17967	
 17968	Two months had elapsed since the news of the battle of Austerlitz and
 17969	the loss of Prince Andrew had reached Bald Hills, and in spite of the
 17970	letters sent through the embassy and all the searches made, his body had
 17971	not been found nor was he on the list of prisoners. What was worst of
 17972	all for his relations was the fact that there was still a possibility of
 17973	his having been picked up on the battlefield by the people of the
 17974	place and that he might now be lying, recovering or dying, alone among
 17975	strangers and unable to send news of himself. The gazettes from which
 17976	the old prince first heard of the defeat at Austerlitz stated, as usual
 17977	very briefly and vaguely, that after brilliant engagements the Russians
 17978	had had to retreat and had made their withdrawal in perfect order. The
 17979	old prince understood from this official report that our army had been
 17980	defeated. A week after the gazette report of the battle of Austerlitz
 17981	came a letter from KutÃºzov informing the prince of the fate that had
 17982	befallen his son.
 17983	
 17984	âYour son,â wrote KutÃºzov, âfell before my eyes, a standard in
 17985	his hand and at the head of a regimentâhe fell as a hero, worthy of
 17986	his father and his fatherland. To the great regret of myself and of the
 17987	whole army it is still uncertain whether he is alive or not. I comfort
 17988	myself and you with the hope that your son is alive, for otherwise
 17989	he would have been mentioned among the officers found on the field of
 17990	battle, a list of whom has been sent me under flag of truce.â
 17991	
 17992	After receiving this news late in the evening, when he was alone in his
 17993	study, the old prince went for his walk as usual next morning, but he
 17994	was silent with his steward, the gardener, and the architect, and though
 17995	he looked very grim he said nothing to anyone.
 17996	
 17997	When Princess Mary went to him at the usual hour he was working at his
 17998	lathe and, as usual, did not look round at her.
 17999	
 18000	âAh, Princess Mary!â he said suddenly in an unnatural voice,
 18001	throwing down his chisel. (The wheel continued to revolve by its own
 18002	impetus, and Princess Mary long remembered the dying creak of that
 18003	wheel, which merged in her memory with what followed.)
 18004	
 18005	She approached him, saw his face, and something gave way within her. Her
 18006	eyes grew dim. By the expression of her fatherâs face, not sad, not
 18007	crushed, but angry and working unnaturally, she saw that hanging over
 18008	her and about to crush her was some terrible misfortune, the worst
 18009	in life, one she had not yet experienced, irreparable and
 18010	incomprehensibleâthe death of one she loved.
 18011	
 18012	âFather! Andrew!ââsaid the ungraceful, awkward princess with such
 18013	an indescribable charm of sorrow and self-forgetfulness that her father
 18014	could not bear her look but turned away with a sob.
 18015	
 18016	âBad news! Heâs not among the prisoners nor among the killed!
 18017	KutÃºzov writes...â and he screamed as piercingly as if he wished to
 18018	drive the princess away by that scream... âKilled!â
 18019	
 18020	The princess did not fall down or faint. She was already pale, but on
 18021	hearing these words her face changed and something brightened in her
 18022	beautiful, radiant eyes. It was as if joyâa supreme joy apart from the
 18023	joys and sorrows of this worldâoverflowed the great grief within her.
 18024	She forgot all fear of her father, went up to him, took his hand, and
 18025	drawing him down put her arm round his thin, scraggy neck.
 18026	
 18027	âFather,â she said, âdo not turn away from me, let us weep
 18028	together.â
 18029	
 18030	âScoundrels! Blackguards!â shrieked the old man, turning his face
 18031	away from her. âDestroying the army, destroying the men! And why? Go,
 18032	go and tell Lise.â
 18033	
 18034	The princess sank helplessly into an armchair beside her father and
 18035	wept. She saw her brother now as he had been at the moment when he took
 18036	leave of her and of Lise, his look tender yet proud. She saw him tender
 18037	and amused as he was when he put on the little icon. âDid he believe?
 18038	Had he repented of his unbelief? Was he now there? There in the realms
 18039	of eternal peace and blessedness?â she thought.
 18040	
 18041	âFather, tell me how it happened,â she asked through her tears.
 18042	
 18043	âGo! Go! Killed in battle, where the best of Russian men and
 18044	Russiaâs glory were led to destruction. Go, Princess Mary. Go and tell
 18045	Lise. I will follow.â
 18046	
 18047	When Princess Mary returned from her father, the little princess sat
 18048	working and looked up with that curious expression of inner, happy calm
 18049	peculiar to pregnant women. It was evident that her eyes did not see
 18050	Princess Mary but were looking within... into herself... at something
 18051	joyful and mysterious taking place within her.
 18052	
 18053	âMary,â she said, moving away from the embroidery frame and lying
 18054	back, âgive me your hand.â She took her sister-in-lawâs hand and
 18055	held it below her waist.
 18056	
 18057	Her eyes were smiling expectantly, her downy lip rose and remained
 18058	lifted in childlike happiness.
 18059	
 18060	Princess Mary knelt down before her and hid her face in the folds of her
 18061	sister-in-lawâs dress.
 18062	
 18063	âThere, there! Do you feel it? I feel so strange. And do you know,
 18064	Mary, I am going to love him very much,â said Lise, looking with
 18065	bright and happy eyes at her sister-in-law.
 18066	
 18067	Princess Mary could not lift her head, she was weeping.
 18068	
 18069	âWhat is the matter, Mary?â
 18070	
 18071	âNothing... only I feel sad... sad about Andrew,â she said, wiping
 18072	away her tears on her sister-in-lawâs knee.
 18073	
 18074	Several times in the course of the morning Princess Mary began trying to
 18075	prepare her sister-in-law, and every time began to cry. Unobservant as
 18076	was the little princess, these tears, the cause of which she did not
 18077	understand, agitated her. She said nothing but looked about uneasily as
 18078	if in search of something. Before dinner the old prince, of whom she was
 18079	always afraid, came into her room with a peculiarly restless and malign
 18080	expression and went out again without saying a word. She looked at
 18081	Princess Mary, then sat thinking for a while with that expression of
 18082	attention to something within her that is only seen in pregnant women,
 18083	and suddenly began to cry.
 18084	
 18085	âHas anything come from Andrew?â she asked.
 18086	
 18087	âNo, you know itâs too soon for news. But my father is anxious and I
 18088	feel afraid.â
 18089	
 18090	âSo thereâs nothing?â
 18091	
 18092	âNothing,â answered Princess Mary, looking firmly with her radiant
 18093	eyes at her sister-in-law.
 18094	
 18095	She had determined not to tell her and persuaded her father to hide the
 18096	terrible news from her till after her confinement, which was expected
 18097	within a few days. Princess Mary and the old prince each bore and hid
 18098	their grief in their own way. The old prince would not cherish any hope:
 18099	he made up his mind that Prince Andrew had been killed, and though he
 18100	sent an official to Austria to seek for traces of his son, he ordered a
 18101	monument from Moscow which he intended to erect in his own garden to his
 18102	memory, and he told everybody that his son had been killed. He tried not
 18103	to change his former way of life, but his strength failed him. He walked
 18104	less, ate less, slept less, and became weaker every day. Princess Mary
 18105	hoped. She prayed for her brother as living and was always awaiting news
 18106	of his return.
 18107

 18112	CHAPTER VIII
 18113	
 18114	âDearest,â said the little princess after breakfast on the morning
 18115	of the nineteenth March, and her downy little lip rose from old habit,
 18116	but as sorrow was manifest in every smile, the sound of every word, and
 18117	even every footstep in that house since the terrible news had come, so
 18118	now the smile of the little princessâinfluenced by the general mood
 18119	though without knowing its causeâwas such as to remind one still more
 18120	of the general sorrow.
 18121	
 18122	âDearest, Iâm afraid this morningâs fruschtique *âas FÃ³ka the
 18123	cook calls itâhas disagreed with me.â
 18124	
 18125	    * FrÃ¼hstÃ¼ck: breakfast.
 18126	
 18127	âWhat is the matter with you, my darling? You look pale. Oh, you
 18128	are very pale!â said Princess Mary in alarm, running with her soft,
 18129	ponderous steps up to her sister-in-law.
 18130	
 18131	âYour excellency, should not Mary BogdÃ¡novna be sent for?â said one
 18132	of the maids who was present. (Mary BogdÃ¡novna was a midwife from the
 18133	neighboring town, who had been at Bald Hills for the last fortnight.)
 18134	
 18135	âOh yes,â assented Princess Mary, âperhaps thatâs it. Iâll go.
 18136	Courage, my angel.â She kissed Lise and was about to leave the room.
 18137	
 18138	âOh, no, no!â And besides the pallor and the physical suffering
 18139	on the little princessâ face, an expression of childish fear of
 18140	inevitable pain showed itself.
 18141	
 18142	âNo, itâs only indigestion?... Say itâs only indigestion, say so,
 18143	Mary! Say...â And the little princess began to cry capriciously like
 18144	a suffering child and to wring her little hands even with some
 18145	affectation. Princess Mary ran out of the room to fetch Mary
 18146	BogdÃ¡novna.
 18147	
 18148	âMon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Oh!â she heard as she left the room.
 18149	
 18150	The midwife was already on her way to meet her, rubbing her small, plump
 18151	white hands with an air of calm importance.
 18152	
 18153	âMary BogdÃ¡novna, I think itâs beginning!â said Princess Mary
 18154	looking at the midwife with wide-open eyes of alarm.
 18155	
 18156	âWell, the Lord be thanked, Princess,â said Mary BogdÃ¡novna, not
 18157	hastening her steps. âYou young ladies should not know anything about
 18158	it.â
 18159	
 18160	âBut how is it the doctor from Moscow is not here yet?â said the
 18161	princess. (In accordance with Liseâs and Prince Andrewâs wishes they
 18162	had sent in good time to Moscow for a doctor and were expecting him at
 18163	any moment.)
 18164	
 18165	âNo matter, Princess, donât be alarmed,â said Mary BogdÃ¡novna.
 18166	âWeâll manage very well without a doctor.â
 18167	
 18168	Five minutes later Princess Mary from her room heard something heavy
 18169	being carried by. She looked out. The men servants were carrying the
 18170	large leather sofa from Prince Andrewâs study into the bedroom. On
 18171	their faces was a quiet and solemn look.
 18172	
 18173	Princess Mary sat alone in her room listening to the sounds in the
 18174	house, now and then opening her door when someone passed and watching
 18175	what was going on in the passage. Some women passing with quiet steps in
 18176	and out of the bedroom glanced at the princess and turned away. She did
 18177	not venture to ask any questions, and shut the door again, now sitting
 18178	down in her easy chair, now taking her prayer book, now kneeling before
 18179	the icon stand. To her surprise and distress she found that her prayers
 18180	did not calm her excitement. Suddenly her door opened softly and her old
 18181	nurse, PraskÃ³vya SÃ¡vishna, who hardly ever came to that room as the
 18182	old prince had forbidden it, appeared on the threshold with a shawl
 18183	round her head.
 18184	
 18185	âIâve come to sit with you a bit, MÃ¡sha,â said the nurse, âand
 18186	here Iâve brought the princeâs wedding candles to light before his
 18187	saint, my angel,â she said with a sigh.
 18188	
 18189	âOh, nurse, Iâm so glad!â
 18190	
 18191	âGod is merciful, birdie.â
 18192	
 18193	The nurse lit the gilt candles before the icons and sat down by the door
 18194	with her knitting. Princess Mary took a book and began reading. Only
 18195	when footsteps or voices were heard did they look at one another, the
 18196	princess anxious and inquiring, the nurse encouraging. Everyone in the
 18197	house was dominated by the same feeling that Princess Mary experienced
 18198	as she sat in her room. But owing to the superstition that the fewer
 18199	the people who know of it the less a woman in travail suffers, everyone
 18200	tried to pretend not to know; no one spoke of it, but apart from the
 18201	ordinary staid and respectful good manners habitual in the princeâs
 18202	household, a common anxiety, a softening of the heart, and a
 18203	consciousness that something great and mysterious was being accomplished
 18204	at that moment made itself felt.
 18205	
 18206	There was no laughter in the maidsâ large hall. In the men servantsâ
 18207	hall all sat waiting, silently and alert. In the outlying serfsâ
 18208	quarters torches and candles were burning and no one slept. The old
 18209	prince, stepping on his heels, paced up and down his study and sent
 18210	TÃ­khon to ask Mary BogdÃ¡novna what news.ââSay only that âthe
 18211	prince told me to ask,â and come and tell me her answer.â
 18212	
 18213	âInform the prince that labor has begun,â said Mary BogdÃ¡novna,
 18214	giving the messenger a significant look.
 18215	
 18216	TÃ­khon went and told the prince.
 18217	
 18218	âVery good!â said the prince closing the door behind him, and
 18219	TÃ­khon did not hear the slightest sound from the study after that.
 18220	
 18221	After a while he re-entered it as if to snuff the candles, and, seeing
 18222	the prince was lying on the sofa, looked at him, noticed his perturbed
 18223	face, shook his head, and going up to him silently kissed him on the
 18224	shoulder and left the room without snuffing the candles or saying why he
 18225	had entered. The most solemn mystery in the world continued its course.
 18226	Evening passed, night came, and the feeling of suspense and softening of
 18227	heart in the presence of the unfathomable did not lessen but increased.
 18228	No one slept.
 18229	
 18230	It was one of those March nights when winter seems to wish to resume its
 18231	sway and scatters its last snows and storms with desperate fury. A relay
 18232	of horses had been sent up the highroad to meet the German doctor from
 18233	Moscow who was expected every moment, and men on horseback with lanterns
 18234	were sent to the crossroads to guide him over the country road with its
 18235	hollows and snow-covered pools of water.
 18236	
 18237	Princess Mary had long since put aside her book: she sat silent, her
 18238	luminous eyes fixed on her nurseâs wrinkled face (every line of which
 18239	she knew so well), on the lock of gray hair that escaped from under the
 18240	kerchief, and the loose skin that hung under her chin.
 18241	
 18242	Nurse SÃ¡vishna, knitting in hand, was telling in low tones, scarcely
 18243	hearing or understanding her own words, what she had told hundreds of
 18244	times before: how the late princess had given birth to Princess Mary
 18245	in KishenÃ«v with only a Moldavian peasant woman to help instead of a
 18246	midwife.
 18247	
 18248	âGod is merciful, doctors are never needed,â she said.
 18249	
 18250	Suddenly a gust of wind beat violently against the casement of the
 18251	window, from which the double frame had been removed (by order of the
 18252	prince, one window frame was removed in each room as soon as the larks
 18253	returned), and, forcing open a loosely closed latch, set the damask
 18254	curtain flapping and blew out the candle with its chill, snowy draft.
 18255	Princess Mary shuddered; her nurse, putting down the stocking she was
 18256	knitting, went to the window and leaning out tried to catch the open
 18257	casement. The cold wind flapped the ends of her kerchief and her loose
 18258	locks of gray hair.
 18259	
 18260	âPrincess, my dear, thereâs someone driving up the avenue!â she
 18261	said, holding the casement and not closing it. âWith lanterns. Most
 18262	likely the doctor.â
 18263	
 18264	âOh, my God! thank God!â said Princess Mary. âI must go and meet
 18265	him, he does not know Russian.â
 18266	
 18267	Princess Mary threw a shawl over her head and ran to meet the newcomer.
 18268	As she was crossing the anteroom she saw through the window a carriage
 18269	with lanterns, standing at the entrance. She went out on the stairs. On
 18270	a banister post stood a tallow candle which guttered in the draft. On
 18271	the landing below, Philip, the footman, stood looking scared and holding
 18272	another candle. Still lower, beyond the turn of the staircase, one
 18273	could hear the footstep of someone in thick felt boots, and a voice that
 18274	seemed familiar to Princess Mary was saying something.
 18275	
 18276	âThank God!â said the voice. âAnd Father?â
 18277	
 18278	âGone to bed,â replied the voice of DemyÃ¡n the house steward, who
 18279	was downstairs.
 18280	
 18281	Then the voice said something more, DemyÃ¡n replied, and the steps in
 18282	the felt boots approached the unseen bend of the staircase more rapidly.
 18283	
 18284	âItâs Andrew!â thought Princess Mary. âNo it canât be, that
 18285	would be too extraordinary,â and at the very moment she thought this,
 18286	the face and figure of Prince Andrew, in a fur cloak the deep collar of
 18287	which covered with snow, appeared on the landing where the footman
 18288	stood with the candle. Yes, it was he, pale, thin, with a changed and
 18289	strangely softened but agitated expression on his face. He came up the
 18290	stairs and embraced his sister.
 18291	
 18292	âYou did not get my letter?â he asked, and not waiting for a
 18293	replyâwhich he would not have received, for the princess was unable to
 18294	speakâhe turned back, rapidly mounted the stairs again with the
 18295	doctor who had entered the hall after him (they had met at the last post
 18296	station), and again embraced his sister.
 18297	
 18298	âWhat a strange fate, MÃ¡sha darling!â And having taken off his
 18299	cloak and felt boots, he went to the little princessâ apartment.

 18305	CHAPTER IX
 18306	
 18307	The little princess lay supported by pillows, with a white cap on her
 18308	head (the pains had just left her). Strands of her black hair lay round
 18309	her inflamed and perspiring cheeks, her charming rosy mouth with its
 18310	downy lip was open and she was smiling joyfully. Prince Andrew entered
 18311	and paused facing her at the foot of the sofa on which she was lying.
 18312	Her glittering eyes, filled with childlike fear and excitement, rested
 18313	on him without changing their expression. âI love you all and have
 18314	done no harm to anyone; why must I suffer so? Help me!â her look
 18315	seemed to say. She saw her husband, but did not realize the significance
 18316	of his appearance before her now. Prince Andrew went round the sofa and
 18317	kissed her forehead.
 18318	
 18319	âMy darling!â he saidâa word he had never used to her before.
 18320	âGod is merciful....â
 18321	
 18322	She looked at him inquiringly and with childlike reproach.
 18323	
 18324	âI expected help from you and I get none, none from you either!â
 18325	said her eyes. She was not surprised at his having come; she did
 18326	not realize that he had come. His coming had nothing to do with
 18327	her sufferings or with their relief. The pangs began again and Mary
 18328	BogdÃ¡novna advised Prince Andrew to leave the room.
 18329	
 18330	The doctor entered. Prince Andrew went out and, meeting Princess Mary,
 18331	again joined her. They began talking in whispers, but their talk broke
 18332	off at every moment. They waited and listened.
 18333	
 18334	âGo, dear,â said Princess Mary.
 18335	
 18336	Prince Andrew went again to his wife and sat waiting in the room next
 18337	to hers. A woman came from the bedroom with a frightened face and became
 18338	confused when she saw Prince Andrew. He covered his face with his hands
 18339	and remained so for some minutes. Piteous, helpless, animal moans came
 18340	through the door. Prince Andrew got up, went to the door, and tried to
 18341	open it. Someone was holding it shut.
 18342	
 18343	âYou canât come in! You canât!â said a terrified voice from
 18344	within.
 18345	
 18346	He began pacing the room. The screaming ceased, and a few more seconds
 18347	went by. Then suddenly a terrible shriekâit could not be hers, she
 18348	could not scream like thatâcame from the bedroom. Prince Andrew ran to
 18349	the door; the scream ceased and he heard the wail of an infant.
 18350	
 18351	âWhat have they taken a baby in there for?â thought Prince Andrew in
 18352	the first second. âA baby? What baby...? Why is there a baby there? Or
 18353	is the baby born?â
 18354	
 18355	Then suddenly he realized the joyful significance of that wail; tears
 18356	choked him, and leaning his elbows on the window sill he began to cry,
 18357	sobbing like a child. The door opened. The doctor with his shirt sleeves
 18358	tucked up, without a coat, pale and with a trembling jaw, came out
 18359	of the room. Prince Andrew turned to him, but the doctor gave him a
 18360	bewildered look and passed by without a word. A woman rushed out and
 18361	seeing Prince Andrew stopped, hesitating on the threshold. He went into
 18362	his wifeâs room. She was lying dead, in the same position he had seen
 18363	her in five minutes before and, despite the fixed eyes and the pallor of
 18364	the cheeks, the same expression was on her charming childlike face with
 18365	its upper lip covered with tiny black hair.
 18366	
 18367	âI love you all, and have done no harm to anyone; and what have you
 18368	done to me?ââsaid her charming, pathetic, dead face.
 18369	
 18370	In a corner of the room something red and tiny gave a grunt and squealed
 18371	in Mary BogdÃ¡novnaâs trembling white hands.
 18372	
 18373	
 18374	Two hours later Prince Andrew, stepping softly, went into his fatherâs
 18375	room. The old man already knew everything. He was standing close to
 18376	the door and as soon as it opened his rough old arms closed like a vise
 18377	round his sonâs neck, and without a word he began to sob like a child.
 18378	
 18379	
 18380	Three days later the little princess was buried, and Prince Andrew went
 18381	up the steps to where the coffin stood, to give her the farewell kiss.
 18382	And there in the coffin was the same face, though with closed eyes.
 18383	âAh, what have you done to me?â it still seemed to say, and Prince
 18384	Andrew felt that something gave way in his soul and that he was guilty
 18385	of a sin he could neither remedy nor forget. He could not weep. The
 18386	old man too came up and kissed the waxen little hands that lay quietly
 18387	crossed one on the other on her breast, and to him, too, her face seemed
 18388	to say: âAh, what have you done to me, and why?â And at the sight
 18389	the old man turned angrily away.
 18390	
 18391	
 18392	Another five days passed, and then the young Prince Nicholas AndrÃ©evich
 18393	was baptized. The wet nurse supported the coverlet with her chin, while
 18394	the priest with a goose feather anointed the boyâs little red and
 18395	wrinkled soles and palms.
 18396	
 18397	His grandfather, who was his godfather, trembling and afraid of dropping
 18398	him, carried the infant round the battered tin font and handed him over
 18399	to the godmother, Princess Mary. Prince Andrew sat in another room,
 18400	faint with fear lest the baby should be drowned in the font, and awaited
 18401	the termination of the ceremony. He looked up joyfully at the baby when
 18402	the nurse brought it to him and nodded approval when she told him that
 18403	the wax with the babyâs hair had not sunk in the font but had floated.
 18404	
 18405

 18409	CHAPTER X
 18410	
 18411	RostÃ³vâs share in DÃ³lokhovâs duel with BezÃºkhov was hushed up by
 18412	the efforts of the old count, and instead of being degraded to the ranks
 18413	as he expected he was appointed an adjutant to the governor general of
 18414	Moscow. As a result he could not go to the country with the rest of the
 18415	family, but was kept all summer in Moscow by his new duties. DÃ³lokhov
 18416	recovered, and RostÃ³v became very friendly with him during his
 18417	convalescence. DÃ³lokhov lay ill at his motherâs who loved him
 18418	passionately and tenderly, and old Mary IvÃ¡novna, who had grown fond of
 18419	RostÃ³v for his friendship to her FÃ©dya, often talked to him about her
 18420	son.
 18421	
 18422	âYes, Count,â she would say, âhe is too noble and pure-souled for
 18423	our present, depraved world. No one now loves virtue; it seems like
 18424	a reproach to everyone. Now tell me, Count, was it right, was it
 18425	honorable, of BezÃºkhov? And FÃ©dya, with his noble spirit, loved him
 18426	and even now never says a word against him. Those pranks in Petersburg
 18427	when they played some tricks on a policeman, didnât they do it
 18428	together? And there! BezÃºkhov got off scotfree, while FÃ©dya had to
 18429	bear the whole burden on his shoulders. Fancy what he had to go through!
 18430	Itâs true he has been reinstated, but how could they fail to do that?
 18431	I think there were not many such gallant sons of the fatherland out
 18432	there as he. And nowâthis duel! Have these people no feeling, or
 18433	honor? Knowing him to be an only son, to challenge him and shoot so
 18434	straight! Itâs well God had mercy on us. And what was it for? Who
 18435	doesnât have intrigues nowadays? Why, if he was so jealous, as I see
 18436	things he should have shown it sooner, but he lets it go on for months.
 18437	And then to call him out, reckoning on FÃ©dya not fighting because he
 18438	owed him money! What baseness! What meanness! I know you understand
 18439	FÃ©dya, my dear count; that, believe me, is why I am so fond of you. Few
 18440	people do understand him. He is such a lofty, heavenly soul!â
 18441	
 18442	DÃ³lokhov himself during his convalescence spoke to RostÃ³v in a way no
 18443	one would have expected of him.
 18444	
 18445	âI know people consider me a bad man!â he said. âLet them! I
 18446	donât care a straw about anyone but those I love; but those I love,
 18447	I love so that I would give my life for them, and the others Iâd
 18448	throttle if they stood in my way. I have an adored, a priceless mother,
 18449	and two or three friendsâyou among themâand as for the rest I only
 18450	care about them in so far as they are harmful or useful. And most of
 18451	them are harmful, especially the women. Yes, dear boy,â he continued,
 18452	âI have met loving, noble, high-minded men, but I have not yet met
 18453	any womenâcountesses or cooksâwho were not venal. I have not yet met
 18454	that divine purity and devotion I look for in women. If I found such a
 18455	one Iâd give my life for her! But those!...â and he made a gesture
 18456	of contempt. âAnd believe me, if I still value my life it is
 18457	only because I still hope to meet such a divine creature, who will
 18458	regenerate, purify, and elevate me. But you donât understand it.â
 18459	
 18460	âOh, yes, I quite understand,â answered RostÃ³v, who was under his
 18461	new friendâs influence.
 18462	
 18463	In the autumn the RostÃ³vs returned to Moscow. Early in the winter
 18464	DenÃ­sov also came back and stayed with them. The first half of the
 18465	winter of 1806, which Nicholas RostÃ³v spent in Moscow, was one of the
 18466	happiest, merriest times for him and the whole family. Nicholas brought
 18467	many young men to his parentsâ house. VÃ©ra was a handsome girl
 18468	of twenty; SÃ³nya a girl of sixteen with all the charm of an opening
 18469	flower; NatÃ¡sha, half grown up and half child, was now childishly
 18470	amusing, now girlishly enchanting.
 18471	
 18472	At that time in the RostÃ³vsâ house there prevailed an amorous
 18473	atmosphere characteristic of homes where there are very young and very
 18474	charming girls. Every young man who came to the houseâseeing those
 18475	impressionable, smiling young faces (smiling probably at their own
 18476	happiness), feeling the eager bustle around him, and hearing the fitful
 18477	bursts of song and music and the inconsequent but friendly prattle of
 18478	young girls ready for anything and full of hopeâexperienced the same
 18479	feeling; sharing with the young folk of the RostÃ³vsâ household a
 18480	readiness to fall in love and an expectation of happiness.
 18481	
 18482	Among the young men introduced by RostÃ³v one of the first was
 18483	DÃ³lokhov, whom everyone in the house liked except NatÃ¡sha. She almost
 18484	quarreled with her brother about him. She insisted that he was a bad
 18485	man, and that in the duel with BezÃºkhov, Pierre was right and DÃ³lokhov
 18486	wrong, and further that he was disagreeable and unnatural.
 18487	
 18488	âThereâs nothing for me to understand,â she cried out with
 18489	resolute self-will, âhe is wicked and heartless. There now, I like
 18490	your DenÃ­sov though he is a rake and all that, still I like him; so
 18491	you see I do understand. I donât know how to put it... with this one
 18492	everything is calculated, and I donât like that. But DenÃ­sov...â
 18493	
 18494	âOh, DenÃ­sov is quite different,â replied Nicholas, implying that
 18495	even DenÃ­sov was nothing compared to DÃ³lokhovââyou must understand
 18496	what a soul there is in DÃ³lokhov, you should see him with his mother.
 18497	What a heart!â
 18498	
 18499	âWell, I donât know about that, but I am uncomfortable with him. And
 18500	do you know he has fallen in love with SÃ³nya?â
 18501	
 18502	âWhat nonsense...â
 18503	
 18504	âIâm certain of it; youâll see.â
 18505	
 18506	NatÃ¡shaâs prediction proved true. DÃ³lokhov, who did not usually care
 18507	for the society of ladies, began to come often to the house, and the
 18508	question for whose sake he came (though no one spoke of it) was soon
 18509	settled. He came because of SÃ³nya. And SÃ³nya, though she would never
 18510	have dared to say so, knew it and blushed scarlet every time DÃ³lokhov
 18511	appeared.
 18512	
 18513	DÃ³lokhov often dined at the RostÃ³vsâ, never missed a performance at
 18514	which they were present, and went to Iogelâs balls for young people
 18515	which the RostÃ³vs always attended. He was pointedly attentive to SÃ³nya
 18516	and looked at her in such a way that not only could she not bear his
 18517	glances without coloring, but even the old countess and NatÃ¡sha blushed
 18518	when they saw his looks.
 18519	
 18520	It was evident that this strange, strong man was under the irresistible
 18521	influence of the dark, graceful girl who loved another.
 18522	
 18523	RostÃ³v noticed something new in DÃ³lokhovâs relations with SÃ³nya,
 18524	but he did not explain to himself what these new relations were.
 18525	âTheyâre always in love with someone,â he thought of SÃ³nya and
 18526	NatÃ¡sha. But he was not as much at ease with SÃ³nya and DÃ³lokhov as
 18527	before and was less frequently at home.
 18528	
 18529	In the autumn of 1806 everybody had again begun talking of the war with
 18530	Napoleon with even greater warmth than the year before. Orders were
 18531	given to raise recruits, ten men in every thousand for the regular army,
 18532	and besides this, nine men in every thousand for the militia. Everywhere
 18533	Bonaparte was anathematized and in Moscow nothing but the coming war
 18534	was talked of. For the RostÃ³v family the whole interest of these
 18535	preparations for war lay in the fact that Nicholas would not hear of
 18536	remaining in Moscow, and only awaited the termination of DenÃ­sovâs
 18537	furlough after Christmas to return with him to their regiment. His
 18538	approaching departure did not prevent his amusing himself, but rather
 18539	gave zest to his pleasures. He spent the greater part of his time away
 18540	from home, at dinners, parties, and balls.
 18541	
 18542	
 18543	
 18544	
 18545	
 18546	CHAPTER XI
 18547	
 18548	On the third day after Christmas Nicholas dined at home, a thing he had
 18549	rarely done of late. It was a grand farewell dinner, as he and DenÃ­sov
 18550	were leaving to join their regiment after Epiphany. About twenty people
 18551	were present, including DÃ³lokhov and DenÃ­sov.
 18552	
 18553	Never had love been so much in the air, and never had the amorous
 18554	atmosphere made itself so strongly felt in the RostÃ³vsâ house as at
 18555	this holiday time. âSeize the moments of happiness, love and be loved!
 18556	That is the only reality in the world, all else is folly. It is the one
 18557	thing we are interested in here,â said the spirit of the place.
 18558	
 18559	Nicholas, having as usual exhausted two pairs of horses, without
 18560	visiting all the places he meant to go to and where he had been invited,
 18561	returned home just before dinner. As soon as he entered he noticed and
 18562	felt the tension of the amorous air in the house, and also noticed a
 18563	curious embarrassment among some of those present. SÃ³nya, DÃ³lokhov,
 18564	and the old countess were especially disturbed, and to a lesser degree
 18565	NatÃ¡sha. Nicholas understood that something must have happened between
 18566	SÃ³nya and DÃ³lokhov before dinner, and with the kindly sensitiveness
 18567	natural to him was very gentle and wary with them both at dinner. On
 18568	that same evening there was to be one of the balls that Iogel (the
 18569	dancing master) gave for his pupils during the holidays.
 18570	
 18571	âNicholas, will you come to Iogelâs? Please do!â said NatÃ¡sha.
 18572	âHe asked you, and VasÃ­li DmÃ­trich * is also going.â
 18573	
 18574	    * DenÃ­sov.
 18575	
 18576	âWhere would I not go at the countessâ command!â said DenÃ­sov,
 18577	who at the RostÃ³vsâ had jocularly assumed the role of NatÃ¡shaâs
 18578	knight. âIâm even weady to dance the pas de chÃ¢le.â
 18579	
 18580	âIf I have time,â answered Nicholas. âBut I promised the
 18581	ArkhÃ¡rovs; they have a party.â
 18582	
 18583	âAnd you?â he asked DÃ³lokhov, but as soon as he had asked the
 18584	question he noticed that it should not have been put.
 18585	
 18586	âPerhaps,â coldly and angrily replied DÃ³lokhov, glancing at SÃ³nya,
 18587	and, scowling, he gave Nicholas just such a look as he had given Pierre
 18588	at the club dinner.
 18589	
 18590	âThere is something up,â thought Nicholas, and he was further
 18591	confirmed in this conclusion by the fact that DÃ³lokhov left immediately
 18592	after dinner. He called NatÃ¡sha and asked her what was the matter.
 18593	
 18594	âAnd I was looking for you,â said NatÃ¡sha running out to him. âI
 18595	told you, but you would not believe it,â she said triumphantly. âHe
 18596	has proposed to SÃ³nya!â
 18597	
 18598	Little as Nicholas had occupied himself with SÃ³nya of late, something
 18599	seemed to give way within him at this news. DÃ³lokhov was a suitable and
 18600	in some respects a brilliant match for the dowerless, orphan girl. From
 18601	the point of view of the old countess and of society it was out of the
 18602	question for her to refuse him. And therefore Nicholasâ first feeling
 18603	on hearing the news was one of anger with SÃ³nya.... He tried to say,
 18604	âThatâs capital; of course sheâll forget her childish promises
 18605	and accept the offer,â but before he had time to say it NatÃ¡sha began
 18606	again.
 18607	
 18608	âAnd fancy! she refused him quite definitely!â adding, after a
 18609	pause, âshe told him she loved another.â
 18610	
 18611	âYes, my SÃ³nya could not have done otherwise!â thought Nicholas.
 18612	
 18613	âMuch as Mamma pressed her, she refused, and I know she wonât change
 18614	once she has said...â
 18615	
 18616	âAnd Mamma pressed her!â said Nicholas reproachfully.
 18617	
 18618	âYes,â said NatÃ¡sha. âDo you know, Nicholasâdonât be
 18619	angryâbut I know you will not marry her. I know, heaven knows how, but
 18620	I know for certain that you wonât marry her.â
 18621	
 18622	âNow you donât know that at all!â said Nicholas. âBut I must
 18623	talk to her. What a darling SÃ³nya is!â he added with a smile.
 18624	
 18625	âAh, she is indeed a darling! Iâll send her to you.â
 18626	
 18627	And NatÃ¡sha kissed her brother and ran away.
 18628	
 18629	A minute later SÃ³nya came in with a frightened, guilty, and scared
 18630	look. Nicholas went up to her and kissed her hand. This was the first
 18631	time since his return that they had talked alone and about their love.
 18632	
 18633	âSophie,â he began, timidly at first and then more and more
 18634	boldly, âif you wish to refuse one who is not only a brilliant and
 18635	advantageous match but a splendid, noble fellow... he is my friend...â
 18636	
 18637	SÃ³nya interrupted him.
 18638	
 18639	âI have already refused,â she said hurriedly.
 18640	
 18641	âIf you are refusing for my sake, I am afraid that I...â
 18642	
 18643	SÃ³nya again interrupted. She gave him an imploring, frightened look.
 18644	
 18645	âNicholas, donât tell me that!â she said.
 18646	
 18647	âNo, but I must. It may be arrogant of me, but still it is best to say
 18648	it. If you refuse him on my account, I must tell you the whole truth. I
 18649	love you, and I think I love you more than anyone else....â
 18650	
 18651	âThat is enough for me,â said SÃ³nya, blushing.
 18652	
 18653	âNo, but I have been in love a thousand times and shall fall in
 18654	love again, though for no one have I such a feeling of friendship,
 18655	confidence, and love as I have for you. Then I am young. Mamma does
 18656	not wish it. In a word, I make no promise. And I beg you to consider
 18657	DÃ³lokhovâs offer,â he said, articulating his friendâs name with
 18658	difficulty.
 18659	
 18660	âDonât say that to me! I want nothing. I love you as a brother and
 18661	always shall, and I want nothing more.â
 18662	
 18663	âYou are an angel: I am not worthy of you, but I am afraid of
 18664	misleading you.â
 18665	
 18666	And Nicholas again kissed her hand.
 18667	
 18668	
 18669	
 18670	
 18671	
 18672	CHAPTER XII
 18673	
 18674	Iogelâs were the most enjoyable balls in Moscow. So said the mothers
 18675	as they watched their young people executing their newly learned steps,
 18676	and so said the youths and maidens themselves as they danced till they
 18677	were ready to drop, and so said the grown-up young men and women who
 18678	came to these balls with an air of condescension and found them most
 18679	enjoyable. That year two marriages had come of these balls. The two
 18680	pretty young Princesses GorchakÃ³v met suitors there and were married
 18681	and so further increased the fame of these dances. What distinguished
 18682	them from others was the absence of host or hostess and the presence of
 18683	the good-natured Iogel, flying about like a feather and bowing according
 18684	to the rules of his art, as he collected the tickets from all his
 18685	visitors. There was the fact that only those came who wished to dance
 18686	and amuse themselves as girls of thirteen and fourteen do who are
 18687	wearing long dresses for the first time. With scarcely any exceptions
 18688	they all were, or seemed to be, prettyâso rapturous were their smiles
 18689	and so sparkling their eyes. Sometimes the best of the pupils, of whom
 18690	NatÃ¡sha, who was exceptionally graceful, was first, even danced the pas
 18691	de chÃ¢le, but at this last ball only the Ã©cossaise, the anglaise, and
 18692	the mazurka, which was just coming into fashion, were danced. Iogel had
 18693	taken a ballroom in BezÃºkhovâs house, and the ball, as everyone said,
 18694	was a great success. There were many pretty girls and the RostÃ³v girls
 18695	were among the prettiest. They were both particularly happy and gay.
 18696	That evening, proud of DÃ³lokhovâs proposal, her refusal, and her
 18697	explanation with Nicholas, SÃ³nya twirled about before she left home
 18698	so that the maid could hardly get her hair plaited, and she was
 18699	transparently radiant with impulsive joy.
 18700	
 18701	NatÃ¡sha no less proud of her first long dress and of being at a real
 18702	ball was even happier. They were both dressed in white muslin with pink
 18703	ribbons.
 18704	
 18705	NatÃ¡sha fell in love the very moment she entered the ballroom. She
 18706	was not in love with anyone in particular, but with everyone. Whatever
 18707	person she happened to look at she was in love with for that moment.
 18708	
 18709	âOh, how delightful it is!â she kept saying, running up to SÃ³nya.
 18710	
 18711	Nicholas and DenÃ­sov were walking up and down, looking with kindly
 18712	patronage at the dancers.
 18713	
 18714	âHow sweet she isâshe will be a weal beauty!â said DenÃ­sov.
 18715	
 18716	âWho?â
 18717	
 18718	âCountess NatÃ¡sha,â answered DenÃ­sov.
 18719	
 18720	âAnd how she dances! What gwace!â he said again after a pause.
 18721	
 18722	âWho are you talking about?â
 18723	
 18724	âAbout your sister,â ejaculated DenÃ­sov testily.
 18725	
 18726	RostÃ³v smiled.
 18727	
 18728	âMy dear count, you were one of my best pupilsâyou must dance,â
 18729	said little Iogel coming up to Nicholas. âLook how many charming young
 18730	ladiesââ He turned with the same request to DenÃ­sov who was also a
 18731	former pupil of his.
 18732	
 18733	âNo, my dear fellow, Iâll be a wallflower,â said DenÃ­sov.
 18734	âDonât you wecollect what bad use I made of your lessons?â
 18735	
 18736	âOh no!â said Iogel, hastening to reassure him. âYou were only
 18737	inattentive, but you had talentâoh yes, you had talent!â
 18738	
 18739	The band struck up the newly introduced mazurka. Nicholas could not
 18740	refuse Iogel and asked SÃ³nya to dance. DenÃ­sov sat down by the old
 18741	ladies and, leaning on his saber and beating time with his foot, told
 18742	them something funny and kept them amused, while he watched the young
 18743	people dancing, Iogel with NatÃ¡sha, his pride and his best pupil, were
 18744	the first couple. Noiselessly, skillfully stepping with his little
 18745	feet in low shoes, Iogel flew first across the hall with NatÃ¡sha, who,
 18746	though shy, went on carefully executing her steps. DenÃ­sov did not
 18747	take his eyes off her and beat time with his saber in a way that clearly
 18748	indicated that if he was not dancing it was because he would not and not
 18749	because he could not. In the middle of a figure he beckoned to RostÃ³v
 18750	who was passing:
 18751	
 18752	âThis is not at all the thing,â he said. âWhat sort of Polish
 18753	mazuwka is this? But she does dance splendidly.â
 18754	
 18755	Knowing that DenÃ­sov had a reputation even in Poland for the masterly
 18756	way in which he danced the mazurka, Nicholas ran up to NatÃ¡sha:
 18757	
 18758	âGo and choose DenÃ­sov. He is a real dancer, a wonder!â he said.
 18759	
 18760	When it came to NatÃ¡shaâs turn to choose a partner, she rose and,
 18761	tripping rapidly across in her little shoes trimmed with bows, ran
 18762	timidly to the corner where DenÃ­sov sat. She saw that everybody was
 18763	looking at her and waiting. Nicholas saw that DenÃ­sov was refusing
 18764	though he smiled delightedly. He ran up to them.
 18765	
 18766	âPlease, VasÃ­li DmÃ­trich,â NatÃ¡sha was saying, âdo come!â
 18767	
 18768	âOh no, let me off, Countess,â DenÃ­sov replied.
 18769	
 18770	âNow then, VÃ¡ska,â said Nicholas.
 18771	
 18772	âThey coax me as if I were VÃ¡ska the cat!â said DenÃ­sov jokingly.
 18773	
 18774	âIâll sing for you a whole evening,â said NatÃ¡sha.
 18775	
 18776	âOh, the faiwy! She can do anything with me!â said DenÃ­sov, and
 18777	he unhooked his saber. He came out from behind the chairs, clasped his
 18778	partnerâs hand firmly, threw back his head, and advanced his foot,
 18779	waiting for the beat. Only on horse back and in the mazurka was
 18780	DenÃ­sovâs short stature not noticeable and he looked the fine fellow
 18781	he felt himself to be. At the right beat of the music he looked sideways
 18782	at his partner with a merry and triumphant air, suddenly stamped with
 18783	one foot, bounded from the floor like a ball, and flew round the room
 18784	taking his partner with him. He glided silently on one foot half across
 18785	the room, and seeming not to notice the chairs was dashing straight at
 18786	them, when suddenly, clinking his spurs and spreading out his legs,
 18787	he stopped short on his heels, stood so a second, stamped on the spot
 18788	clanking his spurs, whirled rapidly round, and, striking his left heel
 18789	against his right, flew round again in a circle. NatÃ¡sha guessed what
 18790	he meant to do, and abandoning herself to him followed his lead hardly
 18791	knowing how. First he spun her round, holding her now with his left, now
 18792	with his right hand, then falling on one knee he twirled her round him,
 18793	and again jumping up, dashed so impetuously forward that it seemed as if
 18794	he would rush through the whole suite of rooms without drawing breath,
 18795	and then he suddenly stopped and performed some new and unexpected
 18796	steps. When at last, smartly whirling his partner round in front of her
 18797	chair, he drew up with a click of his spurs and bowed to her, NatÃ¡sha
 18798	did not even make him a curtsy. She fixed her eyes on him in amazement,
 18799	smiling as if she did not recognize him.
 18800	
 18801	âWhat does this mean?â she brought out.
 18802	
 18803	Although Iogel did not acknowledge this to be the real mazurka, everyone
 18804	was delighted with DenÃ­sovâs skill, he was asked again and again as
 18805	a partner, and the old men began smilingly to talk about Poland and the
 18806	good old days. DenÃ­sov, flushed after the mazurka and mopping himself
 18807	with his handkerchief, sat down by NatÃ¡sha and did not leave her for
 18808	the rest of the evening.
 18809	
 18810	
 18811	
 18812	
 18813	
 18814	CHAPTER XIII
 18815	
 18816	For two days after that RostÃ³v did not see DÃ³lokhov at his own or at
 18817	DÃ³lokhovâs home: on the third day he received a note from him:
 18818	
 18819	As I do not intend to be at your house again for reasons you know
 18820	of, and am going to rejoin my regiment, I am giving a farewell supper
 18821	tonight to my friendsâcome to the English Hotel.
 18822	
 18823	About ten oâclock RostÃ³v went to the English Hotel straight from the
 18824	theater, where he had been with his family and DenÃ­sov. He was at once
 18825	shown to the best room, which DÃ³lokhov had taken for that evening. Some
 18826	twenty men were gathered round a table at which DÃ³lokhov sat between
 18827	two candles. On the table was a pile of gold and paper money, and he
 18828	was keeping the bank. RostÃ³v had not seen him since his proposal and
 18829	SÃ³nyaâs refusal and felt uncomfortable at the thought of how they
 18830	would meet.
 18831	
 18832	DÃ³lokhovâs clear, cold glance met RostÃ³v as soon as he entered the
 18833	door, as though he had long expected him.
 18834	
 18835	âItâs a long time since we met,â he said. âThanks for coming.
 18836	Iâll just finish dealing, and then IlyÃºshka will come with his
 18837	chorus.â
 18838	
 18839	âI called once or twice at your house,â said RostÃ³v, reddening.
 18840	
 18841	DÃ³lokhov made no reply.
 18842	
 18843	âYou may punt,â he said.
 18844	
 18845	RostÃ³v recalled at that moment a strange conversation he had once had
 18846	with DÃ³lokhov. âNone but fools trust to luck in play,â DÃ³lokhov
 18847	had then said.
 18848	
 18849	âOr are you afraid to play with me?â DÃ³lokhov now asked as if
 18850	guessing RostÃ³vâs thought.
 18851	
 18852	Beneath his smile RostÃ³v saw in him the mood he had shown at the club
 18853	dinner and at other times, when as if tired of everyday life he had felt
 18854	a need to escape from it by some strange, and usually cruel, action.
 18855	
 18856	RostÃ³v felt ill at ease. He tried, but failed, to find some joke with
 18857	which to reply to DÃ³lokhovâs words. But before he had thought of
 18858	anything, DÃ³lokhov, looking straight in his face, said slowly and
 18859	deliberately so that everyone could hear:
 18860	
 18861	âDo you remember we had a talk about cards... âHeâs a fool who
 18862	trusts to luck, one should make certain,â and I want to try.â
 18863	
 18864	âTo try his luck or the certainty?â RostÃ³v asked himself.
 18865	
 18866	âWell, youâd better not play,â DÃ³lokhov added, and springing a
 18867	new pack of cards said: âBank, gentlemen!â
 18868	
 18869	Moving the money forward he prepared to deal. RostÃ³v sat down by his
 18870	side and at first did not play. DÃ³lokhov kept glancing at him.
 18871	
 18872	âWhy donât you play?â he asked.
 18873	
 18874	And strange to say Nicholas felt that he could not help taking up a
 18875	card, putting a small stake on it, and beginning to play.
 18876	
 18877	âI have no money with me,â he said.
 18878	
 18879	âIâll trust you.â
 18880	
 18881	RostÃ³v staked five rubles on a card and lost, staked again, and again
 18882	lost. DÃ³lokhov âkilled,â that is, beat, ten cards of RostÃ³vâs
 18883	running.
 18884	
 18885	âGentlemen,â said DÃ³lokhov after he had dealt for some time.
 18886	âPlease place your money on the cards or I may get muddled in the
 18887	reckoning.â
 18888	
 18889	One of the players said he hoped he might be trusted.
 18890	
 18891	âYes, you might, but I am afraid of getting the accounts mixed. So I
 18892	ask you to put the money on your cards,â replied DÃ³lokhov. âDonât
 18893	stint yourself, weâll settle afterwards,â he added, turning to
 18894	RostÃ³v.
 18895	
 18896	The game continued; a waiter kept handing round champagne.
 18897	
 18898	All RostÃ³vâs cards were beaten and he had eight hundred rubles scored
 18899	up against him. He wrote â800 rublesâ on a card, but while the
 18900	waiter filled his glass he changed his mind and altered it to his usual
 18901	stake of twenty rubles.
 18902	
 18903	âLeave it,â said DÃ³lokhov, though he did not seem to be even
 18904	looking at RostÃ³v, âyouâll win it back all the sooner. I lose to
 18905	the others but win from you. Or are you afraid of me?â he asked again.
 18906	
 18907	RostÃ³v submitted. He let the eight hundred remain and laid down a seven
 18908	of hearts with a torn corner, which he had picked up from the floor. He
 18909	well remembered that seven afterwards. He laid down the seven of hearts,
 18910	on which with a broken bit of chalk he had written â800 rublesâ in
 18911	clear upright figures; he emptied the glass of warm champagne that was
 18912	handed him, smiled at DÃ³lokhovâs words, and with a sinking heart,
 18913	waiting for a seven to turn up, gazed at DÃ³lokhovâs hands which held
 18914	the pack. Much depended on RostÃ³vâs winning or losing on that seven
 18915	of hearts. On the previous Sunday the old count had given his son
 18916	two thousand rubles, and though he always disliked speaking of money
 18917	difficulties had told Nicholas that this was all he could let him have
 18918	till May, and asked him to be more economical this time. Nicholas had
 18919	replied that it would be more than enough for him and that he gave his
 18920	word of honor not to take anything more till the spring. Now only twelve
 18921	hundred rubles was left of that money, so that this seven of hearts
 18922	meant for him not only the loss of sixteen hundred rubles, but the
 18923	necessity of going back on his word. With a sinking heart he watched
 18924	DÃ³lokhovâs hands and thought, âNow then, make haste and let me have
 18925	this card and Iâll take my cap and drive home to supper with DenÃ­sov,
 18926	NatÃ¡sha, and SÃ³nya, and will certainly never touch a card again.â At
 18927	that moment his home life, jokes with PÃ©tya, talks with SÃ³nya, duets
 18928	with NatÃ¡sha, piquet with his father, and even his comfortable bed
 18929	in the house on the PovarskÃ¡ya rose before him with such vividness,
 18930	clearness, and charm that it seemed as if it were all a lost and
 18931	unappreciated bliss, long past. He could not conceive that a stupid
 18932	chance, letting the seven be dealt to the right rather than to the left,
 18933	might deprive him of all this happiness, newly appreciated and newly
 18934	illumined, and plunge him into the depths of unknown and undefined
 18935	misery. That could not be, yet he awaited with a sinking heart the
 18936	movement of DÃ³lokhovâs hands. Those broad, reddish hands, with hairy
 18937	wrists visible from under the shirt cuffs, laid down the pack and took
 18938	up a glass and a pipe that were handed him.
 18939	
 18940	âSo you are not afraid to play with me?â repeated DÃ³lokhov, and as
 18941	if about to tell a good story he put down the cards, leaned back in his
 18942	chair, and began deliberately with a smile:
 18943	
 18944	âYes, gentlemen, Iâve been told thereâs a rumor going about Moscow
 18945	that Iâm a sharper, so I advise you to be careful.â
 18946	
 18947	âCome now, deal!â exclaimed RostÃ³v.
 18948	
 18949	âOh, those Moscow gossips!â said DÃ³lokhov, and he took up the cards
 18950	with a smile.
 18951	
 18952	âAah!â RostÃ³v almost screamed lifting both hands to his head. The
 18953	seven he needed was lying uppermost, the first card in the pack. He had
 18954	lost more than he could pay.
 18955	
 18956	âStill, donât ruin yourself!â said DÃ³lokhov with a side glance at
 18957	RostÃ³v as he continued to deal.
 18958	
 18959	
 18960	
 18961	
 18962	
 18963	CHAPTER XIV
 18964	
 18965	An hour and a half later most of the players were but little interested
 18966	in their own play.
 18967	
 18968	The whole interest was concentrated on RostÃ³v. Instead of sixteen
 18969	hundred rubles he had a long column of figures scored against him,
 18970	which he had reckoned up to ten thousand, but that now, as he vaguely
 18971	supposed, must have risen to fifteen thousand. In reality it already
 18972	exceeded twenty thousand rubles. DÃ³lokhov was no longer listening to
 18973	stories or telling them, but followed every movement of RostÃ³vâs
 18974	hands and occasionally ran his eyes over the score against him. He had
 18975	decided to play until that score reached forty-three thousand. He
 18976	had fixed on that number because forty-three was the sum of his and
 18977	SÃ³nyaâs joint ages. RostÃ³v, leaning his head on both hands, sat at
 18978	the table which was scrawled over with figures, wet with spilled wine,
 18979	and littered with cards. One tormenting impression did not leave him:
 18980	that those broad-boned reddish hands with hairy wrists visible from
 18981	under the shirt sleeves, those hands which he loved and hated, held him
 18982	in their power.
 18983	
 18984	âSix hundred rubles, ace, a corner, a nine... winning it backâs
 18985	impossible... Oh, how pleasant it was at home!... The knave, double or
 18986	quits... it canât be!... And why is he doing this to me?â RostÃ³v
 18987	pondered. Sometimes he staked a large sum, but DÃ³lokhov refused to
 18988	accept it and fixed the stake himself. Nicholas submitted to him, and at
 18989	one moment prayed to God as he had done on the battlefield at the bridge
 18990	over the Enns, and then guessed that the card that came first to hand
 18991	from the crumpled heap under the table would save him, now counted the
 18992	cords on his coat and took a card with that number and tried staking the
 18993	total of his losses on it, then he looked round for aid from the other
 18994	players, or peered at the now cold face of DÃ³lokhov and tried to read
 18995	what was passing in his mind.
 18996	
 18997	âHe knows of course what this loss means to me. He canât want my
 18998	ruin. Wasnât he my friend? Wasnât I fond of him? But itâs not his
 18999	fault. Whatâs he to do if he has such luck?... And itâs not my fault
 19000	either,â he thought to himself, âI have done nothing wrong. Have I
 19001	killed anyone, or insulted or wished harm to anyone? Why such a terrible
 19002	misfortune? And when did it begin? Such a little while ago I came to
 19003	this table with the thought of winning a hundred rubles to buy that
 19004	casket for Mammaâs name day and then going home. I was so happy, so
 19005	free, so lighthearted! And I did not realize how happy I was! When did
 19006	that end and when did this new, terrible state of things begin? What
 19007	marked the change? I sat all the time in this same place at this table,
 19008	chose and placed cards, and watched those broad-boned agile hands in the
 19009	same way. When did it happen and what has happened? I am well and strong
 19010	and still the same and in the same place. No, it canât be! Surely it
 19011	will all end in nothing!â
 19012	
 19013	He was flushed and bathed in perspiration, though the room was not hot.
 19014	His face was terrible and piteous to see, especially from its helpless
 19015	efforts to seem calm.
 19016	
 19017	The score against him reached the fateful sum of forty-three thousand.
 19018	RostÃ³v had just prepared a card, by bending the corner of which he
 19019	meant to double the three thousand just put down to his score, when
 19020	DÃ³lokhov, slamming down the pack of cards, put it aside and began
 19021	rapidly adding up the total of RostÃ³vâs debt, breaking the chalk as
 19022	he marked the figures in his clear, bold hand.
 19023	
 19024	âSupper, itâs time for supper! And here are the gypsies!â
 19025	
 19026	Some swarthy men and women were really entering from the cold outside
 19027	and saying something in their gypsy accents. Nicholas understood that it
 19028	was all over; but he said in an indifferent tone:
 19029	
 19030	âWell, wonât you go on? I had a splendid card all ready,â as if it
 19031	were the fun of the game which interested him most.
 19032	
 19033	âItâs all up! Iâm lost!â thought he. âNow a bullet through my
 19034	brainâthatâs all thatâs left me!â And at the same time he said
 19035	in a cheerful voice:
 19036	
 19037	âCome now, just this one more little card!â
 19038	
 19039	âAll right!â said DÃ³lokhov, having finished the addition. âAll
 19040	right! Twenty-one rubles,â he said, pointing to the figure twenty-one
 19041	by which the total exceeded the round sum of forty-three thousand; and
 19042	taking up a pack he prepared to deal. RostÃ³v submissively unbent the
 19043	corner of his card and, instead of the six thousand he had intended,
 19044	carefully wrote twenty-one.
 19045	
 19046	âItâs all the same to me,â he said. âI only want to see whether
 19047	you will let me win this ten, or beat it.â
 19048	
 19049	DÃ³lokhov began to deal seriously. Oh, how RostÃ³v detested at that
 19050	moment those hands with their short reddish fingers and hairy wrists,
 19051	which held him in their power.... The ten fell to him.
 19052	
 19053	âYou owe forty-three thousand, Count,â said DÃ³lokhov, and
 19054	stretching himself he rose from the table. âOne does get tired sitting
 19055	so long,â he added.
 19056	
 19057	âYes, Iâm tired too,â said RostÃ³v.
 19058	
 19059	DÃ³lokhov cut him short, as if to remind him that it was not for him to
 19060	jest.
 19061	
 19062	âWhen am I to receive the money, Count?â
 19063	
 19064	RostÃ³v, flushing, drew DÃ³lokhov into the next room.
 19065	
 19066	âI cannot pay it all immediately. Will you take an I.O.U.?â he said.
 19067	
 19068	âI say, RostÃ³v,â said DÃ³lokhov clearly, smiling and looking
 19069	Nicholas straight in the eyes, âyou know the saying, âLucky in love,
 19070	unlucky at cards.â Your cousin is in love with you, I know.â
 19071	
 19072	âOh, itâs terrible to feel oneself so in this manâs power,â
 19073	thought RostÃ³v. He knew what a shock he would inflict on his father and
 19074	mother by the news of this loss, he knew what a relief it would be to
 19075	escape it all, and felt that DÃ³lokhov knew that he could save him from
 19076	all this shame and sorrow, but wanted now to play with him as a cat does
 19077	with a mouse.
 19078	
 19079	âYour cousin...â DÃ³lokhov started to say, but Nicholas interrupted
 19080	him.
 19081	
 19082	âMy cousin has nothing to do with this and itâs not necessary to
 19083	mention her!â he exclaimed fiercely.
 19084	
 19085	âThen when am I to have it?â
 19086	
 19087	âTomorrow,â replied RostÃ³v and left the room.

 19093	CHAPTER XV
 19094	
 19095	To say âtomorrowâ and keep up a dignified tone was not difficult,
 19096	but to go home alone, see his sisters, brother, mother, and father,
 19097	confess and ask for money he had no right to after giving his word of
 19098	honor, was terrible.
 19099	
 19100	At home, they had not yet gone to bed. The young people, after returning
 19101	from the theater, had had supper and were grouped round the clavichord.
 19102	As soon as Nicholas entered, he was enfolded in that poetic atmosphere
 19103	of love which pervaded the RostÃ³v household that winter and, now after
 19104	DÃ³lokhovâs proposal and Iogelâs ball, seemed to have grown thicker
 19105	round SÃ³nya and NatÃ¡sha as the air does before a thunderstorm. SÃ³nya
 19106	and NatÃ¡sha, in the light-blue dresses they had worn at the theater,
 19107	looking pretty and conscious of it, were standing by the clavichord,
 19108	happy and smiling. VÃ©ra was playing chess with ShinshÃ­n in the drawing
 19109	room. The old countess, waiting for the return of her husband and son,
 19110	sat playing patience with the old gentlewoman who lived in their house.
 19111	DenÃ­sov, with sparkling eyes and ruffled hair, sat at the clavichord
 19112	striking chords with his short fingers, his legs thrown back and his
 19113	eyes rolling as he sang, with his small, husky, but true voice, some
 19114	verses called âEnchantress,â which he had composed, and to which he
 19115	was trying to fit music:
 19116	
 19117	   Enchantress, say, to my forsaken lyre
 19118	   What magic power is this recalls me still?
 19119	   What spark has set my inmost soul on fire,
 19120	   What is this bliss that makes my fingers thrill?
 19121	
 19122	He was singing in passionate tones, gazing with his sparkling
 19123	black-agate eyes at the frightened and happy NatÃ¡sha.
 19124	
 19125	âSplendid! Excellent!â exclaimed NatÃ¡sha. âAnother verse,â she
 19126	said, without noticing Nicholas.
 19127	
 19128	âEverythingâs still the same with them,â thought Nicholas,
 19129	glancing into the drawing room, where he saw VÃ©ra and his mother with
 19130	the old lady.
 19131	
 19132	âAh, and hereâs Nicholas!â cried NatÃ¡sha, running up to him.
 19133	
 19134	âIs Papa at home?â he asked.
 19135	
 19136	âI am so glad youâve come!â said NatÃ¡sha, without answering him.
 19137	âWe are enjoying ourselves! VasÃ­li DmÃ­trich is staying a day longer
 19138	for my sake! Did you know?â
 19139	
 19140	âNo, Papa is not back yet,â said SÃ³nya.
 19141	
 19142	âNicholas, have you come? Come here, dear!â called the old countess
 19143	from the drawing room.
 19144	
 19145	Nicholas went to her, kissed her hand, and sitting down silently at her
 19146	table began to watch her hands arranging the cards. From the dancing
 19147	room, they still heard the laughter and merry voices trying to persuade
 19148	NatÃ¡sha to sing.
 19149	
 19150	âAll wight! All wight!â shouted DenÃ­sov. âItâs no good making
 19151	excuses now! Itâs your turn to sing the baâcawollaâI entweat
 19152	you!â
 19153	
 19154	The countess glanced at her silent son.
 19155	
 19156	âWhat is the matter?â she asked.
 19157	
 19158	âOh, nothing,â said he, as if weary of being continually asked the
 19159	same question. âWill Papa be back soon?â
 19160	
 19161	âI expect so.â
 19162	
 19163	âEverythingâs the same with them. They know nothing about it! Where
 19164	am I to go?â thought Nicholas, and went again into the dancing room
 19165	where the clavichord stood.
 19166	
 19167	SÃ³nya was sitting at the clavichord, playing the prelude to
 19168	DenÃ­sovâs favorite barcarolle. NatÃ¡sha was preparing to sing.
 19169	DenÃ­sov was looking at her with enraptured eyes.
 19170	
 19171	Nicholas began pacing up and down the room.
 19172	
 19173	âWhy do they want to make her sing? How can she sing? Thereâs
 19174	nothing to be happy about!â thought he.
 19175	
 19176	SÃ³nya struck the first chord of the prelude.
 19177	
 19178	âMy God, Iâm a ruined and dishonored man! A bullet through my brain
 19179	is the only thing left meânot singing!â his thoughts ran on. âGo
 19180	away? But where to? Itâs oneâlet them sing!â
 19181	
 19182	He continued to pace the room, looking gloomily at DenÃ­sov and the
 19183	girls and avoiding their eyes.
 19184	
 19185	âNikÃ³lenka, what is the matter?â SÃ³nyaâs eyes fixed on him
 19186	seemed to ask. She noticed at once that something had happened to him.
 19187	
 19188	Nicholas turned away from her. NatÃ¡sha too, with her quick instinct,
 19189	had instantly noticed her brotherâs condition. But, though she noticed
 19190	it, she was herself in such high spirits at that moment, so far from
 19191	sorrow, sadness, or self-reproach, that she purposely deceived herself
 19192	as young people often do. âNo, I am too happy now to spoil my
 19193	enjoyment by sympathy with anyoneâs sorrow,â she felt, and she said
 19194	to herself: âNo, I must be mistaken, he must be feeling happy, just as
 19195	I am.â
 19196	
 19197	âNow, SÃ³nya!â she said, going to the very middle of the room, where
 19198	she considered the resonance was best.
 19199	
 19200	Having lifted her head and let her arms droop lifelessly, as ballet
 19201	dancers do, NatÃ¡sha, rising energetically from her heels to her toes,
 19202	stepped to the middle of the room and stood still.
 19203	
 19204	âYes, thatâs me!â she seemed to say, answering the rapt gaze with
 19205	which DenÃ­sov followed her.
 19206	
 19207	âAnd what is she so pleased about?â thought Nicholas, looking at his
 19208	sister. âWhy isnât she dull and ashamed?â
 19209	
 19210	NatÃ¡sha took the first note, her throat swelled, her chest rose,
 19211	her eyes became serious. At that moment she was oblivious of her
 19212	surroundings, and from her smiling lips flowed sounds which anyone may
 19213	produce at the same intervals and hold for the same time, but which
 19214	leave you cold a thousand times and the thousand and first time thrill
 19215	you and make you weep.
 19216	
 19217	NatÃ¡sha, that winter, had for the first time begun to sing seriously,
 19218	mainly because DenÃ­sov so delighted in her singing. She no longer sang
 19219	as a child, there was no longer in her singing that comical, childish,
 19220	painstaking effect that had been in it before; but she did not yet sing
 19221	well, as all the connoisseurs who heard her said: âIt is not trained,
 19222	but it is a beautiful voice that must be trained.â Only they generally
 19223	said this some time after she had finished singing. While that untrained
 19224	voice, with its incorrect breathing and labored transitions, was
 19225	sounding, even the connoisseurs said nothing, but only delighted in
 19226	it and wished to hear it again. In her voice there was a virginal
 19227	freshness, an unconsciousness of her own powers, and an as yet untrained
 19228	velvety softness, which so mingled with her lack of art in singing that
 19229	it seemed as if nothing in that voice could be altered without spoiling
 19230	it.
 19231	
 19232	âWhat is this?â thought Nicholas, listening to her with widely
 19233	opened eyes. âWhat has happened to her? How she is singing today!â
 19234	And suddenly the whole world centered for him on anticipation of the
 19235	next note, the next phrase, and everything in the world was divided into
 19236	three beats: âOh mio crudele affetto.â... One, two, three... one,
 19237	two, three... One... âOh mio crudele affetto.â... One, two, three...
 19238	One. âOh, this senseless life of ours!â thought Nicholas. âAll
 19239	this misery, and money, and DÃ³lokhov, and anger, and honorâitâs all
 19240	nonsense... but this is real.... Now then, NatÃ¡sha, now then, dearest!
 19241	Now then, darling! How will she take that si? Sheâs taken it! Thank
 19242	God!â And without noticing that he was singing, to strengthen the si
 19243	he sung a second, a third below the high note. âAh, God! How fine! Did
 19244	I really take it? How fortunate!â he thought.
 19245	
 19246	Oh, how that chord vibrated, and how moved was something that was finest
 19247	in RostÃ³vâs soul! And this something was apart from everything else
 19248	in the world and above everything in the world. âWhat were losses, and
 19249	DÃ³lokhov, and words of honor?... All nonsense! One might kill and rob
 19250	and yet be happy....â
 19251	
 19252	
 19253	
 19254	
 19255	
 19256	CHAPTER XVI
 19257	
 19258	It was long since RostÃ³v had felt such enjoyment from music as he
 19259	did that day. But no sooner had NatÃ¡sha finished her barcarolle than
 19260	reality again presented itself. He got up without saying a word and went
 19261	downstairs to his own room. A quarter of an hour later the old count
 19262	came in from his club, cheerful and contented. Nicholas, hearing him
 19263	drive up, went to meet him.
 19264	
 19265	âWellâhad a good time?â said the old count, smiling gaily and
 19266	proudly at his son.
 19267	
 19268	Nicholas tried to say âYes,â but could not: and he nearly burst into
 19269	sobs. The count was lighting his pipe and did not notice his sonâs
 19270	condition.
 19271	
 19272	âAh, it canât be avoided!â thought Nicholas, for the first and
 19273	last time. And suddenly, in the most casual tone, which made him feel
 19274	ashamed of himself, he said, as if merely asking his father to let him
 19275	have the carriage to drive to town:
 19276	
 19277	âPapa, I have come on a matter of business. I was nearly forgetting. I
 19278	need some money.â
 19279	
 19280	âDear me!â said his father, who was in a specially good humor. âI
 19281	told you it would not be enough. How much?â
 19282	
 19283	âVery much,â said Nicholas flushing, and with a stupid careless
 19284	smile, for which he was long unable to forgive himself, âI have lost a
 19285	little, I mean a good deal, a great dealâforty three thousand.â
 19286	
 19287	âWhat! To whom?... Nonsense!â cried the count, suddenly reddening
 19288	with an apoplectic flush over neck and nape as old people do.
 19289	
 19290	âI promised to pay tomorrow,â said Nicholas.
 19291	
 19292	âWell!...â said the old count, spreading out his arms and sinking
 19293	helplessly on the sofa.
 19294	
 19295	âIt canât be helped! It happens to everyone!â said the son, with
 19296	a bold, free, and easy tone, while in his soul he regarded himself as a
 19297	worthless scoundrel whose whole life could not atone for his crime. He
 19298	longed to kiss his fatherâs hands and kneel to beg his forgiveness,
 19299	but said, in a careless and even rude voice, that it happens to
 19300	everyone!
 19301	
 19302	The old count cast down his eyes on hearing his sonâs words and began
 19303	bustlingly searching for something.
 19304	
 19305	âYes, yes,â he muttered, âit will be difficult, I fear, difficult
 19306	to raise... happens to everybody! Yes, who has not done it?â
 19307	
 19308	And with a furtive glance at his sonâs face, the count went out of the
 19309	room.... Nicholas had been prepared for resistance, but had not at all
 19310	expected this.
 19311	
 19312	âPapa! Pa-pa!â he called after him, sobbing, âforgive me!â And
 19313	seizing his fatherâs hand, he pressed it to his lips and burst into
 19314	tears.
 19315	
 19316	While father and son were having their explanation, the mother and
 19317	daughter were having one not less important. NatÃ¡sha came running to
 19318	her mother, quite excited.
 19319	
 19320	âMamma!... Mamma!... He has made me...â
 19321	
 19322	âMade what?â
 19323	
 19324	âMade, made me an offer, Mamma! Mamma!â she exclaimed.
 19325	
 19326	The countess did not believe her ears. DenÃ­sov had proposed. To whom?
 19327	To this chit of a girl, NatÃ¡sha, who not so long ago was playing with
 19328	dolls and who was still having lessons.
 19329	
 19330	âDonât, NatÃ¡sha! What nonsense!â she said, hoping it was a joke.
 19331	
 19332	âNonsense, indeed! I am telling you the fact,â said NatÃ¡sha
 19333	indignantly. âI come to ask you what to do, and you call it
 19334	ânonsense!ââ
 19335	
 19336	The countess shrugged her shoulders.
 19337	
 19338	âIf it is true that Monsieur DenÃ­sov has made you a proposal, tell
 19339	him he is a fool, thatâs all!â
 19340	
 19341	âNo, heâs not a fool!â replied NatÃ¡sha indignantly and seriously.
 19342	
 19343	âWell then, what do you want? Youâre all in love nowadays. Well,
 19344	if you are in love, marry him!â said the countess, with a laugh of
 19345	annoyance. âGood luck to you!â
 19346	
 19347	âNo, Mamma, Iâm not in love with him, I suppose Iâm not in love
 19348	with him.â
 19349	
 19350	âWell then, tell him so.â
 19351	
 19352	âMamma, are you cross? Donât be cross, dear! Is it my fault?â
 19353	
 19354	âNo, but what is it, my dear? Do you want me to go and tell him?â
 19355	said the countess smiling.
 19356	
 19357	âNo, I will do it myself, only tell me what to say. Itâs all very
 19358	well for you,â said NatÃ¡sha, with a responsive smile. âYou should
 19359	have seen how he said it! I know he did not mean to say it, but it came
 19360	out accidently.â
 19361	
 19362	âWell, all the same, you must refuse him.â
 19363	
 19364	âNo, I mustnât. I am so sorry for him! Heâs so nice.â
 19365	
 19366	âWell then, accept his offer. Itâs high time for you to be
 19367	married,â answered the countess sharply and sarcastically.
 19368	
 19369	âNo, Mamma, but Iâm so sorry for him. I donât know how Iâm to
 19370	say it.â
 19371	
 19372	âAnd thereâs nothing for you to say. I shall speak to him myself,â
 19373	said the countess, indignant that they should have dared to treat this
 19374	little NatÃ¡sha as grown up.
 19375	
 19376	âNo, not on any account! I will tell him myself, and youâll listen
 19377	at the door,â and NatÃ¡sha ran across the drawing room to the dancing
 19378	hall, where DenÃ­sov was sitting on the same chair by the clavichord
 19379	with his face in his hands.
 19380	
 19381	He jumped up at the sound of her light step.
 19382	
 19383	âNataly,â he said, moving with rapid steps toward her, âdecide my
 19384	fate. It is in your hands.â
 19385	
 19386	âVasÃ­li DmÃ­trich, Iâm so sorry for you!... No, but you are so
 19387	nice... but it wonât do...not that... but as a friend, I shall always
 19388	love you.â
 19389	
 19390	DenÃ­sov bent over her hand and she heard strange sounds she did not
 19391	understand. She kissed his rough curly black head. At this instant, they
 19392	heard the quick rustle of the countessâ dress. She came up to them.
 19393	
 19394	âVasÃ­li DmÃ­trich, I thank you for the honor,â she said, with an
 19395	embarrassed voice, though it sounded severe to DenÃ­sovââbut my
 19396	daughter is so young, and I thought that, as my sonâs friend, you
 19397	would have addressed yourself first to me. In that case you would not
 19398	have obliged me to give this refusal.â
 19399	
 19400	âCountess...â said DenÃ­sov, with downcast eyes and a guilty face.
 19401	He tried to say more, but faltered.
 19402	
 19403	NatÃ¡sha could not remain calm, seeing him in such a plight. She began
 19404	to sob aloud.
 19405	
 19406	âCountess, I have done wâong,â DenÃ­sov went on in an unsteady
 19407	voice, âbut believe me, I so adore your daughter and all your family
 19408	that I would give my life twice over...â He looked at the countess,
 19409	and seeing her severe face said: âWell, good-by, Countess,â and
 19410	kissing her hand, he left the room with quick resolute strides, without
 19411	looking at NatÃ¡sha.
 19412	
 19413	
 19414	Next day RostÃ³v saw DenÃ­sov off. He did not wish to stay another
 19415	day in Moscow. All DenÃ­sovâs Moscow friends gave him a farewell
 19416	entertainment at the gypsiesâ, with the result that he had no
 19417	recollection of how he was put in the sleigh or of the first three
 19418	stages of his journey.
 19419	
 19420	After DenÃ­sovâs departure, RostÃ³v spent another fortnight in Moscow,
 19421	without going out of the house, waiting for the money his father could
 19422	not at once raise, and he spent most of his time in the girlsâ room.
 19423	
 19424	SÃ³nya was more tender and devoted to him than ever. It was as if she
 19425	wanted to show him that his losses were an achievement that made her
 19426	love him all the more, but Nicholas now considered himself unworthy of
 19427	her.
 19428	
 19429	He filled the girlsâ albums with verses and music, and having at last
 19430	sent DÃ³lokhov the whole forty-three thousand rubles and received his
 19431	receipt, he left at the end of November, without taking leave of any of
 19432	his acquaintances, to overtake his regiment which was already in Poland.

 19445	
 19446	After his interview with his wife Pierre left for Petersburg. At the
 19447	TorzhÃ³k post station, either there were no horses or the postmaster
 19448	would not supply them. Pierre was obliged to wait. Without undressing,
 19449	he lay down on the leather sofa in front of a round table, put his big
 19450	feet in their overboots on the table, and began to reflect.
 19451	
 19452	âWill you have the portmanteaus brought in? And a bed got ready, and
 19453	tea?â asked his valet.
 19454	
 19455	Pierre gave no answer, for he neither heard nor saw anything. He had
 19456	begun to think of the last station and was still pondering on the same
 19457	questionâone so important that he took no notice of what went
 19458	on around him. Not only was he indifferent as to whether he got to
 19459	Petersburg earlier or later, or whether he secured accommodation at this
 19460	station, but compared to the thoughts that now occupied him it was a
 19461	matter of indifference whether he remained there for a few hours or for
 19462	the rest of his life.
 19463	
 19464	The postmaster, his wife, the valet, and a peasant woman selling
 19465	TorzhÃ³k embroidery came into the room offering their services.
 19466	Without changing his careless attitude, Pierre looked at them over his
 19467	spectacles unable to understand what they wanted or how they could go on
 19468	living without having solved the problems that so absorbed him. He had
 19469	been engrossed by the same thoughts ever since the day he returned from
 19470	SokÃ³lniki after the duel and had spent that first agonizing, sleepless
 19471	night. But now, in the solitude of the journey, they seized him with
 19472	special force. No matter what he thought about, he always returned to
 19473	these same questions which he could not solve and yet could not cease to
 19474	ask himself. It was as if the thread of the chief screw which held his
 19475	life together were stripped, so that the screw could not get in or out,
 19476	but went on turning uselessly in the same place.
 19477	
 19478	The postmaster came in and began obsequiously to beg his excellency to
 19479	wait only two hours, when, come what might, he would let his excellency
 19480	have the courier horses. It was plain that he was lying and only wanted
 19481	to get more money from the traveler.
 19482	
 19483	âIs this good or bad?â Pierre asked himself. âIt is good for me,
 19484	bad for another traveler, and for himself itâs unavoidable, because
 19485	he needs money for food; the man said an officer had once given him a
 19486	thrashing for letting a private traveler have the courier horses.
 19487	But the officer thrashed him because he had to get on as quickly as
 19488	possible. And I,â continued Pierre, âshot DÃ³lokhov because I
 19489	considered myself injured, and Louis XVI was executed because they
 19490	considered him a criminal, and a year later they executed those who
 19491	executed himâalso for some reason. What is bad? What is good? What
 19492	should one love and what hate? What does one live for? And what am I?
 19493	What is life, and what is death? What power governs all?â
 19494	
 19495	There was no answer to any of these questions, except one, and that
 19496	not a logical answer and not at all a reply to them. The answer was:
 19497	âYouâll die and all will end. Youâll die and know all, or cease
 19498	asking.â But dying was also dreadful.
 19499	
 19500	The TorzhÃ³k peddler woman, in a whining voice, went on offering her
 19501	wares, especially a pair of goatskin slippers. âI have hundreds of
 19502	rubles I donât know what to do with, and she stands in her tattered
 19503	cloak looking timidly at me,â he thought. âAnd what does she
 19504	want the money for? As if that money could add a hairâs breadth to
 19505	happiness or peace of mind. Can anything in the world make her or me
 19506	less a prey to evil and death?âdeath which ends all and must come
 19507	today or tomorrowâat any rate, in an instant as compared with
 19508	eternity.â And again he twisted the screw with the stripped thread,
 19509	and again it turned uselessly in the same place.
 19510	
 19511	His servant handed him a half-cut novel, in the form of letters, by
 19512	Madame de Souza. He began reading about the sufferings and virtuous
 19513	struggles of a certain Emilie de Mansfeld. âAnd why did she resist
 19514	her seducer when she loved him?â he thought. âGod could not have put
 19515	into her heart an impulse that was against His will. My wifeâas she
 19516	once wasâdid not struggle, and perhaps she was right. Nothing has been
 19517	found out, nothing discovered,â Pierre again said to himself. âAll
 19518	we can know is that we know nothing. And thatâs the height of human
 19519	wisdom.â
 19520	
 19521	Everything within and around him seemed confused, senseless, and
 19522	repellent. Yet in this very repugnance to all his circumstances Pierre
 19523	found a kind of tantalizing satisfaction.
 19524	
 19525	âI make bold to ask your excellency to move a little for this
 19526	gentleman,â said the postmaster, entering the room followed by another
 19527	traveler, also detained for lack of horses.
 19528	
 19529	The newcomer was a short, large-boned, yellow-faced, wrinkled old
 19530	man, with gray bushy eyebrows overhanging bright eyes of an indefinite
 19531	grayish color.
 19532	
 19533	Pierre took his feet off the table, stood up, and lay down on a bed that
 19534	had been got ready for him, glancing now and then at the newcomer, who,
 19535	with a gloomy and tired face, was wearily taking off his wraps with the
 19536	aid of his servant, and not looking at Pierre. With a pair of felt boots
 19537	on his thin bony legs, and keeping on a worn, nankeen-covered, sheepskin
 19538	coat, the traveler sat down on the sofa, leaned back his big head with
 19539	its broad temples and close-cropped hair, and looked at BezÃºkhov. The
 19540	stern, shrewd, and penetrating expression of that look struck Pierre. He
 19541	felt a wish to speak to the stranger, but by the time he had made up his
 19542	mind to ask him a question about the roads, the traveler had closed his
 19543	eyes. His shriveled old hands were folded and on the finger of one of
 19544	them Pierre noticed a large cast iron ring with a seal representing a
 19545	deathâs head. The stranger sat without stirring, either resting or, as
 19546	it seemed to Pierre, sunk in profound and calm meditation. His servant
 19547	was also a yellow, wrinkled old man, without beard or mustache,
 19548	evidently not because he was shaven but because they had never grown.
 19549	This active old servant was unpacking the travelerâs canteen and
 19550	preparing tea. He brought in a boiling samovar. When everything was
 19551	ready, the stranger opened his eyes, moved to the table, filled a
 19552	tumbler with tea for himself and one for the beardless old man to whom
 19553	he passed it. Pierre began to feel a sense of uneasiness, and the
 19554	need, even the inevitability, of entering into conversation with this
 19555	stranger.
 19556	
 19557	The servant brought back his tumbler turned upside down, * with an
 19558	unfinished bit of nibbled sugar, and asked if anything more would be
 19559	wanted.
 19560	
 19561	    * To indicate he did not want more tea.
 19562	
 19563	âNo. Give me the book,â said the stranger.
 19564	
 19565	The servant handed him a book which Pierre took to be a devotional work,
 19566	and the traveler became absorbed in it. Pierre looked at him. All at
 19567	once the stranger closed the book, putting in a marker, and again,
 19568	leaning with his arms on the back of the sofa, sat in his former
 19569	position with his eyes shut. Pierre looked at him and had not time
 19570	to turn away when the old man, opening his eyes, fixed his steady and
 19571	severe gaze straight on Pierreâs face.
 19572	
 19573	Pierre felt confused and wished to avoid that look, but the bright old
 19574	eyes attracted him irresistibly.
 19575	
 19576	
 19577	
 19578	
 19579	
 19580	CHAPTER II
 19581	
 19582	âI have the pleasure of addressing Count BezÃºkhov, if I am not
 19583	mistaken,â said the stranger in a deliberate and loud voice.
 19584	
 19585	Pierre looked silently and inquiringly at him over his spectacles.
 19586	
 19587	âI have heard of you, my dear sir,â continued the stranger, âand
 19588	of your misfortune.â He seemed to emphasize the last word, as if to
 19589	sayââYes, misfortune! Call it what you please, I know that what
 19590	happened to you in Moscow was a misfortune.âââI regret it very
 19591	much, my dear sir.â
 19592	
 19593	Pierre flushed and, hurriedly putting his legs down from the bed, bent
 19594	forward toward the old man with a forced and timid smile.
 19595	
 19596	âI have not referred to this out of curiosity, my dear sir, but for
 19597	greater reasons.â
 19598	
 19599	He paused, his gaze still on Pierre, and moved aside on the sofa by way
 19600	of inviting the other to take a seat beside him. Pierre felt reluctant
 19601	to enter into conversation with this old man, but, submitting to him
 19602	involuntarily, came up and sat down beside him.
 19603	
 19604	âYou are unhappy, my dear sir,â the stranger continued. âYou
 19605	are young and I am old. I should like to help you as far as lies in my
 19606	power.â
 19607	
 19608	âOh, yes!â said Pierre, with a forced smile. âI am very grateful
 19609	to you. Where are you traveling from?â
 19610	
 19611	The strangerâs face was not genial, it was even cold and severe, but
 19612	in spite of this, both the face and words of his new acquaintance were
 19613	irresistibly attractive to Pierre.
 19614	
 19615	âBut if for any reason you donât feel inclined to talk to me,â
 19616	said the old man, âsay so, my dear sir.â And he suddenly smiled, in
 19617	an unexpected and tenderly paternal way.
 19618	
 19619	âOh no, not at all! On the contrary, I am very glad to make your
 19620	acquaintance,â said Pierre. And again, glancing at the strangerâs
 19621	hands, he looked more closely at the ring, with its skullâa Masonic
 19622	sign.
 19623	
 19624	âAllow me to ask,â he said, âare you a Mason?â
 19625	
 19626	âYes, I belong to the Brotherhood of the Freemasons,â said the
 19627	stranger, looking deeper and deeper into Pierreâs eyes. âAnd in
 19628	their name and my own I hold out a brotherly hand to you.â
 19629	
 19630	âI am afraid,â said Pierre, smiling, and wavering between the
 19631	confidence the personality of the Freemason inspired in him and his own
 19632	habit of ridiculing the Masonic beliefsââI am afraid I am very far
 19633	from understandingâhow am I to put it?âI am afraid my way of looking
 19634	at the world is so opposed to yours that we shall not understand one
 19635	another.â
 19636	
 19637	âI know your outlook,â said the Mason, âand the view of life you
 19638	mention, and which you think is the result of your own mental efforts,
 19639	is the one held by the majority of people, and is the invariable fruit
 19640	of pride, indolence, and ignorance. Forgive me, my dear sir, but if I
 19641	had not known it I should not have addressed you. Your view of life is a
 19642	regrettable delusion.â
 19643	
 19644	âJust as I may suppose you to be deluded,â said Pierre, with a faint
 19645	smile.
 19646	
 19647	âI should never dare to say that I know the truth,â said the Mason,
 19648	whose words struck Pierre more and more by their precision and firmness.
 19649	âNo one can attain to truth by himself. Only by laying stone on stone
 19650	with the cooperation of all, by the millions of generations from our
 19651	forefather Adam to our own times, is that temple reared which is to be
 19652	a worthy dwelling place of the Great God,â he added, and closed his
 19653	eyes.
 19654	
 19655	âI ought to tell you that I do not believe... do not believe in
 19656	God,â said Pierre, regretfully and with an effort, feeling it
 19657	essential to speak the whole truth.
 19658	
 19659	The Mason looked intently at Pierre and smiled as a rich man with
 19660	millions in hand might smile at a poor fellow who told him that he, poor
 19661	man, had not the five rubles that would make him happy.
 19662	
 19663	âYes, you do not know Him, my dear sir,â said the Mason. âYou
 19664	cannot know Him. You do not know Him and that is why you are unhappy.â
 19665	
 19666	âYes, yes, I am unhappy,â assented Pierre. âBut what am I to
 19667	do?â
 19668	
 19669	âYou know Him not, my dear sir, and so you are very unhappy. You do
 19670	not know Him, but He is here, He is in me, He is in my words, He is in
 19671	thee, and even in those blasphemous words thou hast just uttered!â
 19672	pronounced the Mason in a stern and tremulous voice.
 19673	
 19674	He paused and sighed, evidently trying to calm himself.
 19675	
 19676	âIf He were not,â he said quietly, âyou and I would not be
 19677	speaking of Him, my dear sir. Of what, of whom, are we speaking? Whom
 19678	hast thou denied?â he suddenly asked with exulting austerity and
 19679	authority in his voice. âWho invented Him, if He did not exist? Whence
 19680	came thy conception of the existence of such an incomprehensible Being?
 19681	didst thou, and why did the whole world, conceive the idea of the
 19682	existence of such an incomprehensible Being, a Being all-powerful,
 19683	eternal, and infinite in all His attributes?...â
 19684	
 19685	He stopped and remained silent for a long time.
 19686	
 19687	Pierre could not and did not wish to break this silence.
 19688	
 19689	âHe exists, but to understand Him is hard,â the Mason began again,
 19690	looking not at Pierre but straight before him, and turning the leaves
 19691	of his book with his old hands which from excitement he could not keep
 19692	still. âIf it were a man whose existence thou didst doubt I could
 19693	bring him to thee, could take him by the hand and show him to thee. But
 19694	how can I, an insignificant mortal, show His omnipotence, His infinity,
 19695	and all His mercy to one who is blind, or who shuts his eyes that he may
 19696	not see or understand Him and may not see or understand his own vileness
 19697	and sinfulness?â He paused again. âWho art thou? Thou dreamest that
 19698	thou art wise because thou couldst utter those blasphemous words,â he
 19699	went on, with a somber and scornful smile. âAnd thou art more foolish
 19700	and unreasonable than a little child, who, playing with the parts of a
 19701	skillfully made watch, dares to say that, as he does not understand
 19702	its use, he does not believe in the master who made it. To know Him is
 19703	hard.... For ages, from our forefather Adam to our own day, we labor to
 19704	attain that knowledge and are still infinitely far from our aim; but
 19705	in our lack of understanding we see only our weakness and His
 19706	greatness....â
 19707	
 19708	Pierre listened with swelling heart, gazing into the Masonâs face with
 19709	shining eyes, not interrupting or questioning him, but believing with
 19710	his whole soul what the stranger said. Whether he accepted the wise
 19711	reasoning contained in the Masonâs words, or believed as a child
 19712	believes, in the speakerâs tone of conviction and earnestness, or
 19713	the tremor of the speakerâs voiceâwhich sometimes almost brokeâor
 19714	those brilliant aged eyes grown old in this conviction, or the calm
 19715	firmness and certainty of his vocation, which radiated from his whole
 19716	being (and which struck Pierre especially by contrast with his own
 19717	dejection and hopelessness)âat any rate, Pierre longed with his whole
 19718	soul to believe and he did believe, and felt a joyful sense of comfort,
 19719	regeneration, and return to life.
 19720	
 19721	âHe is not to be apprehended by reason, but by life,â said the
 19722	Mason.
 19723	
 19724	âI do not understand,â said Pierre, feeling with dismay doubts
 19725	reawakening. He was afraid of any want of clearness, any weakness, in
 19726	the Masonâs arguments; he dreaded not to be able to believe in him.
 19727	âI donât understand,â he said, âhow it is that the mind of man
 19728	cannot attain the knowledge of which you speak.â
 19729	
 19730	The Mason smiled with his gentle fatherly smile.
 19731	
 19732	âThe highest wisdom and truth are like the purest liquid we may wish
 19733	to imbibe,â he said. âCan I receive that pure liquid into an impure
 19734	vessel and judge of its purity? Only by the inner purification of myself
 19735	can I retain in some degree of purity the liquid I receive.â
 19736	
 19737	âYes, yes, that is so,â said Pierre joyfully.
 19738	
 19739	âThe highest wisdom is not founded on reason alone, not on those
 19740	worldly sciences of physics, history, chemistry, and the like, into
 19741	which intellectual knowledge is divided. The highest wisdom is one.
 19742	The highest wisdom has but one scienceâthe science of the wholeâthe
 19743	science explaining the whole creation and manâs place in it. To
 19744	receive that science it is necessary to purify and renew oneâs inner
 19745	self, and so before one can know, it is necessary to believe and to
 19746	perfect oneâs self. And to attain this end, we have the light called
 19747	conscience that God has implanted in our souls.â
 19748	
 19749	âYes, yes,â assented Pierre.
 19750	
 19751	âLook then at thy inner self with the eyes of the spirit, and ask
 19752	thyself whether thou art content with thyself. What hast thou attained
 19753	relying on reason only? What art thou? You are young, you are rich, you
 19754	are clever, you are well educated. And what have you done with all these
 19755	good gifts? Are you content with yourself and with your life?â
 19756	
 19757	âNo, I hate my life,â Pierre muttered, wincing.
 19758	
 19759	âThou hatest it. Then change it, purify thyself; and as thou art
 19760	purified, thou wilt gain wisdom. Look at your life, my dear sir.
 19761	How have you spent it? In riotous orgies and debauchery, receiving
 19762	everything from society and giving nothing in return. You have become
 19763	the possessor of wealth. How have you used it? What have you done
 19764	for your neighbor? Have you ever thought of your tens of thousands
 19765	of slaves? Have you helped them physically and morally? No! You have
 19766	profited by their toil to lead a profligate life. That is what you have
 19767	done. Have you chosen a post in which you might be of service to your
 19768	neighbor? No! You have spent your life in idleness. Then you married, my
 19769	dear sirâtook on yourself responsibility for the guidance of a young
 19770	woman; and what have you done? You have not helped her to find the way
 19771	of truth, my dear sir, but have thrust her into an abyss of deceit and
 19772	misery. A man offended you and you shot him, and you say you do not
 19773	know God and hate your life. There is nothing strange in that, my dear
 19774	sir!â
 19775	
 19776	After these words, the Mason, as if tired by his long discourse, again
 19777	leaned his arms on the back of the sofa and closed his eyes. Pierre
 19778	looked at that aged, stern, motionless, almost lifeless face and moved
 19779	his lips without uttering a sound. He wished to say, âYes, a vile,
 19780	idle, vicious life!â but dared not break the silence.
 19781	
 19782	The Mason cleared his throat huskily, as old men do, and called his
 19783	servant.
 19784	
 19785	âHow about the horses?â he asked, without looking at Pierre.
 19786	
 19787	âThe exchange horses have just come,â answered the servant. âWill
 19788	you not rest here?â
 19789	
 19790	âNo, tell them to harness.â
 19791	
 19792	âCan he really be going away leaving me alone without having told me
 19793	all, and without promising to help me?â thought Pierre, rising with
 19794	downcast head; and he began to pace the room, glancing occasionally at
 19795	the Mason. âYes, I never thought of it, but I have led a contemptible
 19796	and profligate life, though I did not like it and did not want to,â
 19797	thought Pierre. âBut this man knows the truth and, if he wished to,
 19798	could disclose it to me.â
 19799	
 19800	Pierre wished to say this to the Mason, but did not dare to. The
 19801	traveler, having packed his things with his practiced hands, began
 19802	fastening his coat. When he had finished, he turned to BezÃºkhov, and
 19803	said in a tone of indifferent politeness:
 19804	
 19805	âWhere are you going to now, my dear sir?â
 19806	
 19807	âI?... Iâm going to Petersburg,â answered Pierre, in a childlike,
 19808	hesitating voice. âI thank you. I agree with all you have said. But
 19809	do not suppose me to be so bad. With my whole soul I wish to be what you
 19810	would have me be, but I have never had help from anyone.... But it is
 19811	I, above all, who am to blame for everything. Help me, teach me, and
 19812	perhaps I may...â
 19813	
 19814	Pierre could not go on. He gulped and turned away.
 19815	
 19816	The Mason remained silent for a long time, evidently considering.
 19817	
 19818	âHelp comes from God alone,â he said, âbut such measure of help as
 19819	our Order can bestow it will render you, my dear sir. You are going to
 19820	Petersburg. Hand this to Count Willarskiâ (he took out his notebook
 19821	and wrote a few words on a large sheet of paper folded in four).
 19822	âAllow me to give you a piece of advice. When you reach the capital,
 19823	first of all devote some time to solitude and self-examination and do
 19824	not resume your former way of life. And now I wish you a good journey,
 19825	my dear sir,â he added, seeing that his servant had entered... âand
 19826	success.â
 19827	
 19828	The traveler was Joseph AlexÃ©evich BazdÃ©ev, as Pierre saw from the
 19829	postmasterâs book. BazdÃ©ev had been one of the best-known Freemasons
 19830	and Martinists, even in NovÃ­kovâs time. For a long while after he had
 19831	gone, Pierre did not go to bed or order horses but paced up and down
 19832	the room, pondering over his vicious past, and with a rapturous sense
 19833	of beginning anew pictured to himself the blissful, irreproachable,
 19834	virtuous future that seemed to him so easy. It seemed to him that he had
 19835	been vicious only because he had somehow forgotten how good it is to
 19836	be virtuous. Not a trace of his former doubts remained in his soul. He
 19837	firmly believed in the possibility of the brotherhood of men united in
 19838	the aim of supporting one another in the path of virtue, and that is how
 19839	Freemasonry presented itself to him.

 19845	CHAPTER III
 19846	
 19847	On reaching Petersburg Pierre did not let anyone know of his arrival,
 19848	he went nowhere and spent whole days in reading Thomas Ã  Kempis, whose
 19849	book had been sent him by someone unknown. One thing he continually
 19850	realized as he read that book: the joy, hitherto unknown to him,
 19851	of believing in the possibility of attaining perfection, and in the
 19852	possibility of active brotherly love among men, which Joseph AlexÃ©evich
 19853	had revealed to him. A week after his arrival, the young Polish count,
 19854	Willarski, whom Pierre had known slightly in Petersburg society, came
 19855	into his room one evening in the official and ceremonious manner in
 19856	which DÃ³lokhovâs second had called on him, and, having closed the
 19857	door behind him and satisfied himself that there was nobody else in the
 19858	room, addressed Pierre.
 19859	
 19860	âI have come to you with a message and an offer, Count,â he
 19861	said without sitting down. âA person of very high standing in our
 19862	Brotherhood has made application for you to be received into our Order
 19863	before the usual term and has proposed to me to be your sponsor. I
 19864	consider it a sacred duty to fulfill that personâs wishes. Do you wish
 19865	to enter the Brotherhood of Freemasons under my sponsorship?â
 19866	
 19867	The cold, austere tone of this man, whom he had almost always before met
 19868	at balls, amiably smiling in the society of the most brilliant women,
 19869	surprised Pierre.
 19870	
 19871	âYes, I do wish it,â said he.
 19872	
 19873	Willarski bowed his head.
 19874	
 19875	âOne more question, Count,â he said, âwhich I beg you to answer
 19876	in all sincerityânot as a future Mason but as an honest man: have you
 19877	renounced your former convictionsâdo you believe in God?â
 19878	
 19879	Pierre considered.
 19880	
 19881	âYes... yes, I believe in God,â he said.
 19882	
 19883	âIn that case...â began Willarski, but Pierre interrupted him.
 19884	
 19885	âYes, I do believe in God,â he repeated.
 19886	
 19887	âIn that case we can go,â said Willarski. âMy carriage is at your
 19888	service.â
 19889	
 19890	Willarski was silent throughout the drive. To Pierreâs inquiries as
 19891	to what he must do and how he should answer, Willarski only replied that
 19892	brothers more worthy than he would test him and that Pierre had only to
 19893	tell the truth.
 19894	
 19895	Having entered the courtyard of a large house where the Lodge had its
 19896	headquarters, and having ascended a dark staircase, they entered a small
 19897	well-lit anteroom where they took off their cloaks without the aid of
 19898	a servant. From there they passed into another room. A man in strange
 19899	attire appeared at the door. Willarski, stepping toward him, said
 19900	something to him in French in an undertone and then went up to a small
 19901	wardrobe in which Pierre noticed garments such as he had never seen
 19902	before. Having taken a kerchief from the cupboard, Willarski bound
 19903	Pierreâs eyes with it and tied it in a knot behind, catching some
 19904	hairs painfully in the knot. Then he drew his face down, kissed him, and
 19905	taking him by the hand led him forward. The hairs tied in the knot hurt
 19906	Pierre and there were lines of pain on his face and a shamefaced smile.
 19907	His huge figure, with arms hanging down and with a puckered, though
 19908	smiling face, moved after Willarski with uncertain, timid steps.
 19909	
 19910	Having led him about ten paces, Willarski stopped.
 19911	
 19912	âWhatever happens to you,â he said, âyou must bear it all manfully
 19913	if you have firmly resolved to join our Brotherhood.â (Pierre nodded
 19914	affirmatively.) âWhen you hear a knock at the door, you will uncover
 19915	your eyes,â added Willarski. âI wish you courage and success,â
 19916	and, pressing Pierreâs hand, he went out.
 19917	
 19918	Left alone, Pierre went on smiling in the same way. Once or twice
 19919	he shrugged his shoulders and raised his hand to the kerchief, as if
 19920	wishing to take it off, but let it drop again. The five minutes spent
 19921	with his eyes bandaged seemed to him an hour. His arms felt numb,
 19922	his legs almost gave way, it seemed to him that he was tired out. He
 19923	experienced a variety of most complex sensations. He felt afraid of what
 19924	would happen to him and still more afraid of showing his fear. He felt
 19925	curious to know what was going to happen and what would be revealed to
 19926	him; but most of all, he felt joyful that the moment had come when he
 19927	would at last start on that path of regeneration and on the actively
 19928	virtuous life of which he had been dreaming since he met Joseph
 19929	AlexÃ©evich. Loud knocks were heard at the door. Pierre took the bandage
 19930	off his eyes and glanced around him. The room was in black darkness,
 19931	only a small lamp was burning inside something white. Pierre went nearer
 19932	and saw that the lamp stood on a black table on which lay an open book.
 19933	The book was the Gospel, and the white thing with the lamp inside was a
 19934	human skull with its cavities and teeth. After reading the first words
 19935	of the Gospel: âIn the beginning was the Word and the Word was with
 19936	God,â Pierre went round the table and saw a large open box filled
 19937	with something. It was a coffin with bones inside. He was not at all
 19938	surprised by what he saw. Hoping to enter on an entirely new life quite
 19939	unlike the old one, he expected everything to be unusual, even more
 19940	unusual than what he was seeing. A skull, a coffin, the Gospelâit
 19941	seemed to him that he had expected all this and even more. Trying
 19942	to stimulate his emotions he looked around. âGod, death, love, the
 19943	brotherhood of man,â he kept saying to himself, associating these
 19944	words with vague yet joyful ideas. The door opened and someone came in.
 19945	
 19946	By the dim light, to which Pierre had already become accustomed, he
 19947	saw a rather short man. Having evidently come from the light into the
 19948	darkness, the man paused, then moved with cautious steps toward the
 19949	table and placed on it his small leather-gloved hands.
 19950	
 19951	This short man had on a white leather apron which covered his chest and
 19952	part of his legs; he had on a kind of necklace above which rose a high
 19953	white ruffle, outlining his rather long face which was lit up from
 19954	below.
 19955	
 19956	âFor what have you come hither?â asked the newcomer, turning in
 19957	Pierreâs direction at a slight rustle made by the latter. âWhy have
 19958	you, who do not believe in the truth of the light and who have not
 19959	seen the light, come here? What do you seek from us? Wisdom, virtue,
 19960	enlightenment?â
 19961	
 19962	At the moment the door opened and the stranger came in, Pierre felt a
 19963	sense of awe and veneration such as he had experienced in his boyhood at
 19964	confession; he felt himself in the presence of one socially a complete
 19965	stranger, yet nearer to him through the brotherhood of man. With bated
 19966	breath and beating heart he moved toward the Rhetor (by which name the
 19967	brother who prepared a seeker for entrance into the Brotherhood was
 19968	known). Drawing nearer, he recognized in the Rhetor a man he knew,
 19969	SmolyanÃ­nov, and it mortified him to think that the newcomer was an
 19970	acquaintanceâhe wished him simply a brother and a virtuous instructor.
 19971	For a long time he could not utter a word, so that the Rhetor had to
 19972	repeat his question.
 19973	
 19974	âYes... I... I... desire regeneration,â Pierre uttered with
 19975	difficulty.
 19976	
 19977	âVery well,â said SmolyanÃ­nov, and went on at once: âHave you any
 19978	idea of the means by which our holy Order will help you to reach your
 19979	aim?â said he quietly and quickly.
 19980	
 19981	âI... hope... for guidance... help... in regeneration,â said Pierre,
 19982	with a trembling voice and some difficulty in utterance due to his
 19983	excitement and to being unaccustomed to speak of abstract matters in
 19984	Russian.
 19985	
 19986	âWhat is your conception of Freemasonry?â
 19987	
 19988	âI imagine that Freemasonry is the fraternity and equality of men who
 19989	have virtuous aims,â said Pierre, feeling ashamed of the inadequacy
 19990	of his words for the solemnity of the moment, as he spoke. âI
 19991	imagine...â
 19992	
 19993	âGood!â said the Rhetor quickly, apparently satisfied with
 19994	this answer. âHave you sought for means of attaining your aim in
 19995	religion?â
 19996	
 19997	âNo, I considered it erroneous and did not follow it,â said Pierre,
 19998	so softly that the Rhetor did not hear him and asked him what he was
 19999	saying. âI have been an atheist,â answered Pierre.
 20000	
 20001	âYou are seeking for truth in order to follow its laws in your life,
 20002	therefore you seek wisdom and virtue. Is that not so?â said the
 20003	Rhetor, after a momentâs pause.
 20004	
 20005	âYes, yes,â assented Pierre.
 20006	
 20007	The Rhetor cleared his throat, crossed his gloved hands on his breast,
 20008	and began to speak.
 20009	
 20010	âNow I must disclose to you the chief aim of our Order,â he said,
 20011	âand if this aim coincides with yours, you may enter our Brotherhood
 20012	with profit. The first and chief object of our Order, the foundation on
 20013	which it rests and which no human power can destroy, is the preservation
 20014	and handing on to posterity of a certain important mystery... which
 20015	has come down to us from the remotest ages, even from the first manâa
 20016	mystery on which perhaps the fate of mankind depends. But since this
 20017	mystery is of such a nature that nobody can know or use it unless he be
 20018	prepared by long and diligent self-purification, not everyone can hope
 20019	to attain it quickly. Hence we have a secondary aim, that of preparing
 20020	our members as much as possible to reform their hearts, to purify and
 20021	enlighten their minds, by means handed on to us by tradition from those
 20022	who have striven to attain this mystery, and thereby to render them
 20023	capable of receiving it.
 20024	
 20025	âBy purifying and regenerating our members we try, thirdly, to improve
 20026	the whole human race, offering it in our members an example of piety
 20027	and virtue, and thereby try with all our might to combat the evil which
 20028	sways the world. Think this over and I will come to you again.â
 20029	
 20030	âTo combat the evil which sways the world...â Pierre repeated, and a
 20031	mental image of his future activity in this direction rose in his mind.
 20032	He imagined men such as he had himself been a fortnight ago, and he
 20033	addressed an edifying exhortation to them. He imagined to himself
 20034	vicious and unfortunate people whom he would assist by word and deed,
 20035	imagined oppressors whose victims he would rescue. Of the three
 20036	objects mentioned by the Rhetor, this last, that of improving mankind,
 20037	especially appealed to Pierre. The important mystery mentioned by the
 20038	Rhetor, though it aroused his curiosity, did not seem to him essential,
 20039	and the second aim, that of purifying and regenerating himself, did not
 20040	much interest him because at that moment he felt with delight that he
 20041	was already perfectly cured of his former faults and was ready for all
 20042	that was good.
 20043	
 20044	Half an hour later, the Rhetor returned to inform the seeker of the
 20045	seven virtues, corresponding to the seven steps of Solomonâs temple,
 20046	which every Freemason should cultivate in himself. These virtues were:
 20047	1. Discretion, the keeping of the secrets of the Order. 2. Obedience to
 20048	those of higher ranks in the Order. 3. Morality. 4. Love of mankind. 5.
 20049	Courage. 6. Generosity. 7. The love of death.
 20050	
 20051	âIn the seventh place, try, by the frequent thought of death,â the
 20052	Rhetor said, âto bring yourself to regard it not as a dreaded foe, but
 20053	as a friend that frees the soul grown weary in the labors of virtue
 20054	from this distressful life, and leads it to its place of recompense and
 20055	peace.â
 20056	
 20057	âYes, that must be so,â thought Pierre, when after these words the
 20058	Rhetor went away, leaving him to solitary meditation. âIt must be so,
 20059	but I am still so weak that I love my life, the meaning of which is only
 20060	now gradually opening before me.â But five of the other virtues which
 20061	Pierre recalled, counting them on his fingers, he felt already in his
 20062	soul: courage, generosity, morality, love of mankind, and especially
 20063	obedienceâwhich did not even seem to him a virtue, but a joy. (He now
 20064	felt so glad to be free from his own lawlessness and to submit his will
 20065	to those who knew the indubitable truth.) He forgot what the seventh
 20066	virtue was and could not recall it.
 20067	
 20068	The third time the Rhetor came back more quickly and asked Pierre
 20069	whether he was still firm in his intention and determined to submit to
 20070	all that would be required of him.
 20071	
 20072	âI am ready for everything,â said Pierre.
 20073	
 20074	âI must also inform you,â said the Rhetor, âthat our Order
 20075	delivers its teaching not in words only but also by other means, which
 20076	may perhaps have a stronger effect on the sincere seeker after wisdom
 20077	and virtue than mere words. This chamber with what you see therein
 20078	should already have suggested to your heart, if it is sincere, more than
 20079	words could do. You will perhaps also see in your further initiation a
 20080	like method of enlightenment. Our Order imitates the ancient societies
 20081	that explained their teaching by hieroglyphics. A hieroglyph,â said
 20082	the Rhetor, âis an emblem of something not cognizable by the senses
 20083	but which possesses qualities resembling those of the symbol.â
 20084	
 20085	Pierre knew very well what a hieroglyph was, but dared not speak. He
 20086	listened to the Rhetor in silence, feeling from all he said that his
 20087	ordeal was about to begin.
 20088	
 20089	âIf you are resolved, I must begin your initiation,â said the Rhetor
 20090	coming closer to Pierre. âIn token of generosity I ask you to give me
 20091	all your valuables.â
 20092	
 20093	âBut I have nothing here,â replied Pierre, supposing that he was
 20094	asked to give up all he possessed.
 20095	
 20096	âWhat you have with you: watch, money, rings....â
 20097	
 20098	Pierre quickly took out his purse and watch, but could not manage for
 20099	some time to get the wedding ring off his fat finger. When that had been
 20100	done, the Rhetor said:
 20101	
 20102	âIn token of obedience, I ask you to undress.â
 20103	
 20104	Pierre took off his coat, waistcoat, and left boot according to the
 20105	Rhetorâs instructions. The Mason drew the shirt back from Pierreâs
 20106	left breast, and stooping down pulled up the left leg of his trousers
 20107	to above the knee. Pierre hurriedly began taking off his right boot also
 20108	and was going to tuck up the other trouser leg to save this stranger the
 20109	trouble, but the Mason told him that was not necessary and gave him
 20110	a slipper for his left foot. With a childlike smile of embarrassment,
 20111	doubt, and self-derision, which appeared on his face against his will,
 20112	Pierre stood with his arms hanging down and legs apart, before his
 20113	brother Rhetor, and awaited his further commands.
 20114	
 20115	âAnd now, in token of candor, I ask you to reveal to me your chief
 20116	passion,â said the latter.
 20117	
 20118	âMy passion! I have had so many,â replied Pierre.
 20119	
 20120	âThat passion which more than all others caused you to waver on the
 20121	path of virtue,â said the Mason.
 20122	
 20123	Pierre paused, seeking a reply.
 20124	
 20125	âWine? Gluttony? Idleness? Laziness? Irritability? Anger? Women?â
 20126	He went over his vices in his mind, not knowing to which of them to give
 20127	the pre-eminence.
 20128	
 20129	âWomen,â he said in a low, scarcely audible voice.
 20130	
 20131	The Mason did not move and for a long time said nothing after this
 20132	answer. At last he moved up to Pierre and, taking the kerchief that lay
 20133	on the table, again bound his eyes.
 20134	
 20135	âFor the last time I say to youâturn all your attention upon
 20136	yourself, put a bridle on your senses, and seek blessedness, not in
 20137	passion but in your own heart. The source of blessedness is not without
 20138	us but within....â
 20139	
 20140	Pierre had already long been feeling in himself that refreshing source
 20141	of blessedness which now flooded his heart with glad emotion.
 20142	
 20143	
 20144	
 20145	
 20146	
 20147	CHAPTER IV
 20148	
 20149	Soon after this there came into the dark chamber to fetch Pierre, not
 20150	the Rhetor but Pierreâs sponsor, Willarski, whom he recognized by his
 20151	voice. To fresh questions as to the firmness of his resolution Pierre
 20152	replied: âYes, yes, I agree,â and with a beaming, childlike smile,
 20153	his fat chest uncovered, stepping unevenly and timidly in one slippered
 20154	and one booted foot, he advanced, while Willarski held a sword to his
 20155	bare chest. He was conducted from that room along passages that turned
 20156	backwards and forwards and was at last brought to the doors of the
 20157	Lodge. Willarski coughed, he was answered by the Masonic knock with
 20158	mallets, the doors opened before them. A bass voice (Pierre was still
 20159	blindfolded) questioned him as to who he was, when and where he was
 20160	born, and so on. Then he was again led somewhere still blindfolded,
 20161	and as they went along he was told allegories of the toils of his
 20162	pilgrimage, of holy friendship, of the Eternal Architect of the
 20163	universe, and of the courage with which he should endure toils and
 20164	dangers. During these wanderings, Pierre noticed that he was spoken
 20165	of now as the âSeeker,â now as the âSufferer,â and now as the
 20166	âPostulant,â to the accompaniment of various knockings with
 20167	mallets and swords. As he was being led up to some object he noticed a
 20168	hesitation and uncertainty among his conductors. He heard those around
 20169	him disputing in whispers and one of them insisting that he should be
 20170	led along a certain carpet. After that they took his right hand, placed
 20171	it on something, and told him to hold a pair of compasses to his left
 20172	breast with the other hand and to repeat after someone who read aloud
 20173	an oath of fidelity to the laws of the Order. The candles were then
 20174	extinguished and some spirit lighted, as Pierre knew by the smell, and
 20175	he was told that he would now see the lesser light. The bandage was
 20176	taken off his eyes and, by the faint light of the burning spirit,
 20177	Pierre, as in a dream, saw several men standing before him, wearing
 20178	aprons like the Rhetorâs and holding swords in their hands pointed at
 20179	his breast. Among them stood a man whose white shirt was stained with
 20180	blood. On seeing this, Pierre moved forward with his breast toward the
 20181	swords, meaning them to pierce it. But the swords were drawn back from
 20182	him and he was at once blindfolded again.
 20183	
 20184	âNow thou hast seen the lesser light,â uttered a voice. Then the
 20185	candles were relit and he was told that he would see the full light; the
 20186	bandage was again removed and more than ten voices said together: âSic
 20187	transit gloria mundi.â
 20188	
 20189	Pierre gradually began to recover himself and looked about at the room
 20190	and at the people in it. Round a long table covered with black sat some
 20191	twelve men in garments like those he had already seen. Some of them
 20192	Pierre had met in Petersburg society. In the Presidentâs chair sat a
 20193	young man he did not know, with a peculiar cross hanging from his
 20194	neck. On his right sat the Italian abbÃ© whom Pierre had met at
 20195	Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs two years before. There were also present a very
 20196	distinguished dignitary and a Swiss who had formerly been tutor at the
 20197	KurÃ¡ginsâ. All maintained a solemn silence, listening to the words
 20198	of the President, who held a mallet in his hand. Let into the wall was
 20199	a star-shaped light. At one side of the table was a small carpet with
 20200	various figures worked upon it, at the other was something resembling an
 20201	altar on which lay a Testament and a skull. Round it stood seven large
 20202	candlesticks like those used in churches. Two of the brothers led Pierre
 20203	up to the altar, placed his feet at right angles, and bade him lie down,
 20204	saying that he must prostrate himself at the Gates of the Temple.
 20205	
 20206	âHe must first receive the trowel,â whispered one of the brothers.
 20207	
 20208	âOh, hush, please!â said another.
 20209	
 20210	Pierre, perplexed, looked round with his shortsighted eyes without
 20211	obeying, and suddenly doubts arose in his mind. âWhere am I? What am
 20212	I doing? Arenât they laughing at me? Shanât I be ashamed to remember
 20213	this?â But these doubts only lasted a moment. Pierre glanced at
 20214	the serious faces of those around, remembered all he had already gone
 20215	through, and realized that he could not stop halfway. He was aghast
 20216	at his hesitation and, trying to arouse his former devotional feeling,
 20217	prostrated himself before the Gates of the Temple. And really, the
 20218	feeling of devotion returned to him even more strongly than before. When
 20219	he had lain there some time, he was told to get up, and a white leather
 20220	apron, such as the others wore, was put on him: he was given a trowel
 20221	and three pairs of gloves, and then the Grand Master addressed him. He
 20222	told him that he should try to do nothing to stain the whiteness of that
 20223	apron, which symbolized strength and purity; then of the unexplained
 20224	trowel, he told him to toil with it to cleanse his own heart from vice,
 20225	and indulgently to smooth with it the heart of his neighbor. As to the
 20226	first pair of gloves, a manâs, he said that Pierre could not know
 20227	their meaning but must keep them. The second pair of manâs gloves
 20228	he was to wear at the meetings, and finally of the third, a pair of
 20229	womenâs gloves, he said: âDear brother, these womanâs gloves are
 20230	intended for you too. Give them to the woman whom you shall honor most
 20231	of all. This gift will be a pledge of your purity of heart to her whom
 20232	you select to be your worthy helpmeet in Masonry.â And after a pause,
 20233	he added: âBut beware, dear brother, that these gloves do not deck
 20234	hands that are unclean.â While the Grand Master said these last words
 20235	it seemed to Pierre that he grew embarrassed. Pierre himself grew still
 20236	more confused, blushed like a child till tears came to his eyes, began
 20237	looking about him uneasily, and an awkward pause followed.
 20238	
 20239	This silence was broken by one of the brethren, who led Pierre up to the
 20240	rug and began reading to him from a manuscript book an explanation of
 20241	all the figures on it: the sun, the moon, a hammer, a plumb line, a
 20242	trowel, a rough stone and a squared stone, a pillar, three windows, and
 20243	so on. Then a place was assigned to Pierre, he was shown the signs of
 20244	the Lodge, told the password, and at last was permitted to sit down.
 20245	The Grand Master began reading the statutes. They were very long, and
 20246	Pierre, from joy, agitation, and embarrassment, was not in a state to
 20247	understand what was being read. He managed to follow only the last words
 20248	of the statutes and these remained in his mind.
 20249	
 20250	âIn our temples we recognize no other distinctions,â read the Grand
 20251	Master, âbut those between virtue and vice. Beware of making any
 20252	distinctions which may infringe equality. Fly to a brotherâs aid
 20253	whoever he may be, exhort him who goeth astray, raise him that falleth,
 20254	never bear malice or enmity toward thy brother. Be kindly and courteous.
 20255	Kindle in all hearts the flame of virtue. Share thy happiness with thy
 20256	neighbor, and may envy never dim the purity of that bliss. Forgive thy
 20257	enemy, do not avenge thyself except by doing him good. Thus fulfilling
 20258	the highest law thou shalt regain traces of the ancient dignity which
 20259	thou hast lost.â
 20260	
 20261	He finished and, getting up, embraced and kissed Pierre, who, with tears
 20262	of joy in his eyes, looked round him, not knowing how to answer the
 20263	congratulations and greetings from acquaintances that met him on all
 20264	sides. He acknowledged no acquaintances but saw in all these men only
 20265	brothers, and burned with impatience to set to work with them.
 20266	
 20267	The Grand Master rapped with his mallet. All the Masons sat down in
 20268	their places, and one of them read an exhortation on the necessity of
 20269	humility.
 20270	
 20271	The Grand Master proposed that the last duty should be performed,
 20272	and the distinguished dignitary who bore the title of âCollector
 20273	of Almsâ went round to all the brothers. Pierre would have liked
 20274	to subscribe all he had, but fearing that it might look like pride
 20275	subscribed the same amount as the others.
 20276	
 20277	The meeting was at an end, and on reaching home Pierre felt as if he had
 20278	returned from a long journey on which he had spent dozens of years, had
 20279	become completely changed, and had quite left behind his former habits
 20280	and way of life.
 20281	
 20282	
 20283	
 20284	
 20285	
 20286	CHAPTER V
 20287	
 20288	The day after he had been received into the Lodge, Pierre was sitting at
 20289	home reading a book and trying to fathom the significance of the Square,
 20290	one side of which symbolized God, another moral things, a third
 20291	physical things, and the fourth a combination of these. Now and then
 20292	his attention wandered from the book and the Square and he formed in
 20293	imagination a new plan of life. On the previous evening at the Lodge, he
 20294	had heard that a rumor of his duel had reached the Emperor and that it
 20295	would be wiser for him to leave Petersburg. Pierre proposed going to his
 20296	estates in the south and there attending to the welfare of his serfs.
 20297	He was joyfully planning this new life, when Prince VasÃ­li suddenly
 20298	entered the room.
 20299	
 20300	âMy dear fellow, what have you been up to in Moscow? Why have you
 20301	quarreled with HÃ©lÃ¨ne, mon cher? You are under a delusion,â said
 20302	Prince VasÃ­li, as he entered. âI know all about it, and I can tell
 20303	you positively that HÃ©lÃ¨ne is as innocent before you as Christ was
 20304	before the Jews.â
 20305	
 20306	Pierre was about to reply, but Prince VasÃ­li interrupted him.
 20307	
 20308	âAnd why didnât you simply come straight to me as to a friend? I
 20309	know all about it and understand it all,â he said. âYou behaved as
 20310	becomes a man who values his honor, perhaps too hastily, but we wonât
 20311	go into that. But consider the position in which you are placing her and
 20312	me in the eyes of society, and even of the court,â he added, lowering
 20313	his voice. âShe is living in Moscow and you are here. Remember,
 20314	dear boy,â and he drew Pierreâs arm downwards, âit is simply a
 20315	misunderstanding. I expect you feel it so yourself. Let us write her
 20316	a letter at once, and sheâll come here and all will be explained, or
 20317	else, my dear boy, let me tell you itâs quite likely youâll have to
 20318	suffer for it.â
 20319	
 20320	Prince VasÃ­li gave Pierre a significant look.
 20321	
 20322	âI know from reliable sources that the Dowager Empress is taking a
 20323	keen interest in the whole affair. You know she is very gracious to
 20324	HÃ©lÃ¨ne.â
 20325	
 20326	Pierre tried several times to speak, but, on one hand, Prince VasÃ­li
 20327	did not let him and, on the other, Pierre himself feared to begin to
 20328	speak in the tone of decided refusal and disagreement in which he had
 20329	firmly resolved to answer his father-in-law. Moreover, the words of the
 20330	Masonic statutes, âbe kindly and courteous,â recurred to him. He
 20331	blinked, went red, got up and sat down again, struggling with himself
 20332	to do what was for him the most difficult thing in lifeâto say an
 20333	unpleasant thing to a manâs face, to say what the other, whoever
 20334	he might be, did not expect. He was so used to submitting to Prince
 20335	VasÃ­liâs tone of careless self-assurance that he felt he would be
 20336	unable to withstand it now, but he also felt that on what he said now
 20337	his future dependedâwhether he would follow the same old road, or that
 20338	new path so attractively shown him by the Masons, on which he firmly
 20339	believed he would be reborn to a new life.
 20340	
 20341	âNow, dear boy,â said Prince VasÃ­li playfully, âsay âyes,â
 20342	and Iâll write to her myself, and we will kill the fatted calf.â
 20343	
 20344	But before Prince VasÃ­li had finished his playful speech, Pierre,
 20345	without looking at him, and with a kind of fury that made him like his
 20346	father, muttered in a whisper:
 20347	
 20348	âPrince, I did not ask you here. Go, please go!â And he jumped up
 20349	and opened the door for him.
 20350	
 20351	âGo!â he repeated, amazed at himself and glad to see the look of
 20352	confusion and fear that showed itself on Prince VasÃ­liâs face.
 20353	
 20354	âWhatâs the matter with you? Are you ill?â
 20355	
 20356	âGo!â the quivering voice repeated. And Prince VasÃ­li had to go
 20357	without receiving any explanation.
 20358	
 20359	A week later, Pierre, having taken leave of his new friends, the Masons,
 20360	and leaving large sums of money with them for alms, went away to his
 20361	estates. His new brethren gave him letters to the Kiev and Odessa Masons
 20362	and promised to write to him and guide him in his new activity.
 20363	
 20364	
 20365	
 20366	
 20367	
 20368	CHAPTER VI
 20369	
 20370	The duel between Pierre and DÃ³lokhov was hushed up and, in spite of
 20371	the Emperorâs severity regarding duels at that time, neither the
 20372	principals nor their seconds suffered for it. But the story of the duel,
 20373	confirmed by Pierreâs rupture with his wife, was the talk of society.
 20374	Pierre who had been regarded with patronizing condescension when he was
 20375	an illegitimate son, and petted and extolled when he was the best
 20376	match in Russia, had sunk greatly in the esteem of society after his
 20377	marriageâwhen the marriageable daughters and their mothers had nothing
 20378	to hope from himâespecially as he did not know how, and did not
 20379	wish, to court societyâs favor. Now he alone was blamed for what had
 20380	happened, he was said to be insanely jealous and subject like his
 20381	father to fits of bloodthirsty rage. And when after Pierreâs
 20382	departure HÃ©lÃ¨ne returned to Petersburg, she was received by all her
 20383	acquaintances not only cordially, but even with a shade of deference
 20384	due to her misfortune. When conversation turned on her husband HÃ©lÃ¨ne
 20385	assumed a dignified expression, which with characteristic tact she had
 20386	acquired though she did not understand its significance. This expression
 20387	suggested that she had resolved to endure her troubles uncomplainingly
 20388	and that her husband was a cross laid upon her by God. Prince VasÃ­li
 20389	expressed his opinion more openly. He shrugged his shoulders when Pierre
 20390	was mentioned and, pointing to his forehead, remarked:
 20391	
 20392	âA bit touchedâI always said so.â
 20393	
 20394	âI said from the first,â declared Anna PÃ¡vlovna referring to
 20395	Pierre, âI said at the time and before anyone elseâ (she insisted
 20396	on her priority) âthat that senseless young man was spoiled by the
 20397	depraved ideas of these days. I said so even at the time when everybody
 20398	was in raptures about him, when he had just returned from abroad, and
 20399	when, if you remember, he posed as a sort of Marat at one of my soirees.
 20400	And how has it ended? I was against this marriage even then and foretold
 20401	all that has happened.â
 20402	
 20403	Anna PÃ¡vlovna continued to give on free evenings the same kind of
 20404	soirees as beforeâsuch as she alone had the gift of arrangingâat
 20405	which was to be found âthe cream of really good society, the bloom
 20406	of the intellectual essence of Petersburg,â as she herself put it.
 20407	Besides this refined selection of society Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs receptions
 20408	were also distinguished by the fact that she always presented some new
 20409	and interesting person to the visitors and that nowhere else was the
 20410	state of the political thermometer of legitimate Petersburg court
 20411	society so dearly and distinctly indicated.
 20412	
 20413	Toward the end of 1806, when all the sad details of Napoleonâs
 20414	destruction of the Prussian army at Jena and AuerstÃ¤dt and the
 20415	surrender of most of the Prussian fortresses had been received, when our
 20416	troops had already entered Prussia and our second war with Napoleon
 20417	was beginning, Anna PÃ¡vlovna gave one of her soirees. The âcream of
 20418	really good societyâ consisted of the fascinating HÃ©lÃ¨ne, forsaken
 20419	by her husband, Mortemart, the delightful Prince Hippolyte who had
 20420	just returned from Vienna, two diplomatists, the old aunt, a young man
 20421	referred to in that drawing room as âa man of great meritâ (un homme
 20422	de beaucoup de mÃ©rite), a newly appointed maid of honor and her mother,
 20423	and several other less noteworthy persons.
 20424	
 20425	The novelty Anna PÃ¡vlovna was setting before her guests that evening
 20426	was BorÃ­s DrubetskÃ³y, who had just arrived as a special messenger from
 20427	the Prussian army and was aide-de-camp to a very important personage.
 20428	
 20429	The temperature shown by the political thermometer to the company that
 20430	evening was this:
 20431	
 20432	âWhatever the European sovereigns and commanders may do to
 20433	countenance Bonaparte, and to cause me, and us in general, annoyance and
 20434	mortification, our opinion of Bonaparte cannot alter. We shall not cease
 20435	to express our sincere views on that subject, and can only say to the
 20436	King of Prussia and others: âSo much the worse for you. Tu lâas
 20437	voulu, George Dandin,â thatâs all we have to say about it!â
 20438	
 20439	When BorÃ­s, who was to be served up to the guests, entered the drawing
 20440	room, almost all the company had assembled, and the conversation, guided
 20441	by Anna PÃ¡vlovna, was about our diplomatic relations with Austria and
 20442	the hope of an alliance with her.
 20443	
 20444	BorÃ­s, grown more manly and looking fresh, rosy and self-possessed,
 20445	entered the drawing room elegantly dressed in the uniform of an
 20446	aide-de-camp and was duly conducted to pay his respects to the aunt and
 20447	then brought back to the general circle.
 20448	
 20449	Anna PÃ¡vlovna gave him her shriveled hand to kiss and introduced him to
 20450	several persons whom he did not know, giving him a whispered description
 20451	of each.
 20452	
 20453	âPrince Hippolyte KurÃ¡ginâcharming young fellow; M.
 20454	Kronq,âchargÃ© dâaffaires from Copenhagenâa profound intellect,â
 20455	and simply, âMr. ShÃ­tovâa man of great meritââthis of the man
 20456	usually so described.
 20457	
 20458	Thanks to Anna MikhÃ¡ylovnaâs efforts, his own tastes, and the
 20459	peculiarities of his reserved nature, BorÃ­s had managed during his
 20460	service to place himself very advantageously. He was aide-de-camp to a
 20461	very important personage, had been sent on a very important mission to
 20462	Prussia, and had just returned from there as a special messenger. He had
 20463	become thoroughly conversant with that unwritten code with which he had
 20464	been so pleased at OlmÃ¼tz and according to which an ensign might rank
 20465	incomparably higher than a general, and according to which what was
 20466	needed for success in the service was not effort or work, or courage, or
 20467	perseverance, but only the knowledge of how to get on with those who can
 20468	grant rewards, and he was himself often surprised at the rapidity of his
 20469	success and at the inability of others to understand these things.
 20470	In consequence of this discovery his whole manner of life, all
 20471	his relations with old friends, all his plans for his future, were
 20472	completely altered. He was not rich, but would spend his last groat to
 20473	be better dressed than others, and would rather deprive himself of many
 20474	pleasures than allow himself to be seen in a shabby equipage or appear
 20475	in the streets of Petersburg in an old uniform. He made friends with
 20476	and sought the acquaintance of only those above him in position and
 20477	who could therefore be of use to him. He liked Petersburg and despised
 20478	Moscow. The remembrance of the RostÃ³vsâ house and of his childish
 20479	love for NatÃ¡sha was unpleasant to him and he had not once been to see
 20480	the RostÃ³vs since the day of his departure for the army. To be in Anna
 20481	PÃ¡vlovnaâs drawing room he considered an important step up in the
 20482	service, and he at once understood his role, letting his hostess make
 20483	use of whatever interest he had to offer. He himself carefully scanned
 20484	each face, appraising the possibilities of establishing intimacy with
 20485	each of those present, and the advantages that might accrue. He took
 20486	the seat indicated to him beside the fair HÃ©lÃ¨ne and listened to the
 20487	general conversation.
 20488	
 20489	âVienna considers the bases of the proposed treaty so unattainable
 20490	that not even a continuity of most brilliant successes would secure
 20491	them, and she doubts the means we have of gaining them. That is the
 20492	actual phrase used by the Vienna cabinet,â said the Danish chargÃ©
 20493	dâaffaires.
 20494	
 20495	âThe doubt is flattering,â said âthe man of profound intellect,â
 20496	with a subtle smile.
 20497	
 20498	âWe must distinguish between the Vienna cabinet and the Emperor of
 20499	Austria,â said Mortemart. âThe Emperor of Austria can never have
 20500	thought of such a thing, it is only the cabinet that says it.â
 20501	
 20502	âAh, my dear vicomte,â put in Anna PÃ¡vlovna, âLâUropeâ (for
 20503	some reason she called it Urope as if that were a specially refined
 20504	French pronunciation which she could allow herself when conversing with
 20505	a Frenchman), âLâUrope ne sera jamais notre alliÃ©e sincÃ¨re.â *
 20506	
 20507	    * âEurope will never be our sincere ally.â
 20508	
 20509	
 20510	After that Anna PÃ¡vlovna led up to the courage and firmness of the King
 20511	of Prussia, in order to draw BorÃ­s into the conversation.
 20512	
 20513	BorÃ­s listened attentively to each of the speakers, awaiting his turn,
 20514	but managed meanwhile to look round repeatedly at his neighbor, the
 20515	beautiful HÃ©lÃ¨ne, whose eyes several times met those of the handsome
 20516	young aide-de-camp with a smile.
 20517	
 20518	Speaking of the position of Prussia, Anna PÃ¡vlovna very naturally asked
 20519	BorÃ­s to tell them about his journey to Glogau and in what state he
 20520	found the Prussian army. BorÃ­s, speaking with deliberation, told them
 20521	in pure, correct French many interesting details about the armies and
 20522	the court, carefully abstaining from expressing an opinion of his
 20523	own about the facts he was recounting. For some time he engrossed the
 20524	general attention, and Anna PÃ¡vlovna felt that the novelty she had
 20525	served up was received with pleasure by all her visitors. The greatest
 20526	attention of all to BorÃ­sâ narrative was shown by HÃ©lÃ¨ne. She asked
 20527	him several questions about his journey and seemed greatly interested in
 20528	the state of the Prussian army. As soon as he had finished she turned to
 20529	him with her usual smile.
 20530	
 20531	âYou absolutely must come and see me,â she said in a tone that
 20532	implied that, for certain considerations he could not know of, this was
 20533	absolutely necessary.
 20534	
 20535	âOn Tuesday between eight and nine. It will give me great pleasure.â
 20536	
 20537	BorÃ­s promised to fulfill her wish and was about to begin a
 20538	conversation with her, when Anna PÃ¡vlovna called him away on the
 20539	pretext that her aunt wished to hear him.
 20540	
 20541	âYou know her husband, of course?â said Anna PÃ¡vlovna, closing her
 20542	eyes and indicating HÃ©lÃ¨ne with a sorrowful gesture. âAh, she is
 20543	such an unfortunate and charming woman! Donât mention him before
 20544	herâplease donât! It is too painful for her!â
 20545	
 20546	
 20547	
 20548	
 20549	
 20550	CHAPTER VII
 20551	
 20552	When BorÃ­s and Anna PÃ¡vlovna returned to the others Prince Hippolyte
 20553	had the ear of the company.
 20554	
 20555	Bending forward in his armchair he said: âLe Roi de Prusse!â and
 20556	having said this laughed. Everyone turned toward him.
 20557	
 20558	âLe Roi de Prusse?â Hippolyte said interrogatively, again laughing,
 20559	and then calmly and seriously sat back in his chair. Anna PÃ¡vlovna
 20560	waited for him to go on, but as he seemed quite decided to say no more
 20561	she began to tell of how at Potsdam the impious Bonaparte had stolen the
 20562	sword of Frederick the Great.
 20563	
 20564	âIt is the sword of Frederick the Great which I...â she began, but
 20565	Hippolyte interrupted her with the words: âLe Roi de Prusse...â and
 20566	again, as soon as all turned toward him, excused himself and said no
 20567	more.
 20568	
 20569	Anna PÃ¡vlovna frowned. Mortemart, Hippolyteâs friend, addressed him
 20570	firmly.
 20571	
 20572	âCome now, what about your Roi de Prusse?â
 20573	
 20574	Hippolyte laughed as if ashamed of laughing.
 20575	
 20576	âOh, itâs nothing. I only wished to say...â (he wanted to repeat
 20577	a joke he had heard in Vienna and which he had been trying all that
 20578	evening to get in) âI only wished to say that we are wrong to fight
 20579	pour le Roi de Prusse!â
 20580	
 20581	BorÃ­s smiled circumspectly, so that it might be taken as ironical
 20582	or appreciative according to the way the joke was received. Everybody
 20583	laughed.
 20584	
 20585	âYour joke is too bad, itâs witty but unjust,â said Anna
 20586	PÃ¡vlovna, shaking her little shriveled finger at him.
 20587	
 20588	âWe are not fighting pour le Roi de Prusse, but for right principles.
 20589	Oh, that wicked Prince Hippolyte!â she said.
 20590	
 20591	The conversation did not flag all evening and turned chiefly on the
 20592	political news. It became particularly animated toward the end of the
 20593	evening when the rewards bestowed by the Emperor were mentioned.
 20594	
 20595	âYou know Nâ Nâ received a snuffbox with the portrait last
 20596	year?â said âthe man of profound intellect.â âWhy shouldnât
 20597	Sâ Sâ get the same distinction?â
 20598	
 20599	âPardon me! A snuffbox with the Emperorâs portrait is a reward but
 20600	not a distinction,â said the diplomatistââa gift, rather.â
 20601	
 20602	âThere are precedents, I may mention Schwarzenberg.â
 20603	
 20604	âItâs impossible,â replied another.
 20605	
 20606	âWill you bet? The ribbon of the order is a different matter....â
 20607	
 20608	When everybody rose to go, HÃ©lÃ¨ne who had spoken very little all
 20609	the evening again turned to BorÃ­s, asking him in a tone of caressing
 20610	significant command to come to her on Tuesday.
 20611	
 20612	âIt is of great importance to me,â she said, turning with a smile
 20613	toward Anna PÃ¡vlovna, and Anna PÃ¡vlovna, with the same sad smile with
 20614	which she spoke of her exalted patroness, supported HÃ©lÃ¨neâs wish.
 20615	
 20616	It seemed as if from some words BorÃ­s had spoken that evening about the
 20617	Prussian army, HÃ©lÃ¨ne had suddenly found it necessary to see him.
 20618	She seemed to promise to explain that necessity to him when he came on
 20619	Tuesday.
 20620	
 20621	But on Tuesday evening, having come to HÃ©lÃ¨neâs splendid salon,
 20622	BorÃ­s received no clear explanation of why it had been necessary for
 20623	him to come. There were other guests and the countess talked little to
 20624	him, and only as he kissed her hand on taking leave said unexpectedly
 20625	and in a whisper, with a strangely unsmiling face: âCome to dinner
 20626	tomorrow... in the evening. You must come.... Come!â
 20627	
 20628	During that stay in Petersburg, BorÃ­s became an intimate in the
 20629	countessâ house.
 20630

 20635	CHAPTER VIII
 20636	
 20637	The war was flaming up and nearing the Russian frontier. Everywhere one
 20638	heard curses on Bonaparte, âthe enemy of mankind.â Militiamen and
 20639	recruits were being enrolled in the villages, and from the seat of
 20640	war came contradictory news, false as usual and therefore variously
 20641	interpreted. The life of old Prince BolkÃ³nski, Prince Andrew, and
 20642	Princess Mary had greatly changed since 1805.
 20643	
 20644	In 1806 the old prince was made one of the eight commanders in chief
 20645	then appointed to supervise the enrollment decreed throughout Russia.
 20646	Despite the weakness of age, which had become particularly noticeable
 20647	since the time when he thought his son had been killed, he did not think
 20648	it right to refuse a duty to which he had been appointed by the Emperor
 20649	himself, and this fresh opportunity for action gave him new energy
 20650	and strength. He was continually traveling through the three provinces
 20651	entrusted to him, was pedantic in the fulfillment of his duties, severe
 20652	to cruel with his subordinates, and went into everything down to the
 20653	minutest details himself. Princess Mary had ceased taking lessons in
 20654	mathematics from her father, and when the old prince was at home went
 20655	to his study with the wet nurse and little Prince Nicholas (as his
 20656	grandfather called him). The baby Prince Nicholas lived with his wet
 20657	nurse and nurse SÃ¡vishna in the late princessâ rooms and Princess
 20658	Mary spent most of the day in the nursery, taking a motherâs place to
 20659	her little nephew as best she could. Mademoiselle Bourienne, too, seemed
 20660	passionately fond of the boy, and Princess Mary often deprived herself
 20661	to give her friend the pleasure of dandling the little angelâas she
 20662	called her nephewâand playing with him.
 20663	
 20664	Near the altar of the church at Bald Hills there was a chapel over the
 20665	tomb of the little princess, and in this chapel was a marble monument
 20666	brought from Italy, representing an angel with outspread wings ready to
 20667	fly upwards. The angelâs upper lip was slightly raised as though
 20668	about to smile, and once on coming out of the chapel Prince Andrew and
 20669	Princess Mary admitted to one another that the angelâs face reminded
 20670	them strangely of the little princess. But what was still stranger,
 20671	though of this Prince Andrew said nothing to his sister, was that in the
 20672	expression the sculptor had happened to give the angelâs face, Prince
 20673	Andrew read the same mild reproach he had read on the face of his dead
 20674	wife: âAh, why have you done this to me?â
 20675	
 20676	Soon after Prince Andrewâs return the old prince made over to him a
 20677	large estate, BoguchÃ¡rovo, about twenty-five miles from Bald Hills.
 20678	Partly because of the depressing memories associated with Bald Hills,
 20679	partly because Prince Andrew did not always feel equal to bearing with
 20680	his fatherâs peculiarities, and partly because he needed solitude,
 20681	Prince Andrew made use of BoguchÃ¡rovo, began building and spent most of
 20682	his time there.
 20683	
 20684	After the Austerlitz campaign Prince Andrew had firmly resolved not
 20685	to continue his military service, and when the war recommenced
 20686	and everybody had to serve, he took a post under his father in the
 20687	recruitment so as to avoid active service. The old prince and his son
 20688	seemed to have changed roles since the campaign of 1805. The old man,
 20689	roused by activity, expected the best results from the new campaign,
 20690	while Prince Andrew on the contrary, taking no part in the war and
 20691	secretly regretting this, saw only the dark side.
 20692	
 20693	On February 26, 1807, the old prince set off on one of his circuits.
 20694	Prince Andrew remained at Bald Hills as usual during his fatherâs
 20695	absence. Little Nicholas had been unwell for four days. The coachman who
 20696	had driven the old prince to town returned bringing papers and letters
 20697	for Prince Andrew.
 20698	
 20699	Not finding the young prince in his study the valet went with the
 20700	letters to Princess Maryâs apartments, but did not find him there. He
 20701	was told that the prince had gone to the nursery.
 20702	
 20703	âIf you please, your excellency, PÃ©trusha has brought some papers,â
 20704	said one of the nursemaids to Prince Andrew who was sitting on a
 20705	childâs little chair while, frowning and with trembling hands, he
 20706	poured drops from a medicine bottle into a wineglass half full of water.
 20707	
 20708	âWhat is it?â he said crossly, and, his hand shaking
 20709	unintentionally, he poured too many drops into the glass. He threw the
 20710	mixture onto the floor and asked for some more water. The maid brought
 20711	it.
 20712	
 20713	There were in the room a childâs cot, two boxes, two armchairs, a
 20714	table, a childâs table, and the little chair on which Prince Andrew
 20715	was sitting. The curtains were drawn, and a single candle was burning on
 20716	the table, screened by a bound music book so that the light did not fall
 20717	on the cot.
 20718	
 20719	âMy dear,â said Princess Mary, addressing her brother from beside
 20720	the cot where she was standing, âbetter wait a bit... later...â
 20721	
 20722	âOh, leave off, you always talk nonsense and keep putting things
 20723	offâand this is what comes of it!â said Prince Andrew in an
 20724	exasperated whisper, evidently meaning to wound his sister.
 20725	
 20726	âMy dear, really... itâs better not to wake him... heâs asleep,â
 20727	said the princess in a tone of entreaty.
 20728	
 20729	Prince Andrew got up and went on tiptoe up to the little bed, wineglass
 20730	in hand.
 20731	
 20732	âPerhaps weâd really better not wake him,â he said hesitating.
 20733	
 20734	âAs you please... really... I think so... but as you please,â said
 20735	Princess Mary, evidently intimidated and confused that her opinion
 20736	had prevailed. She drew her brotherâs attention to the maid who was
 20737	calling him in a whisper.
 20738	
 20739	It was the second night that neither of them had slept, watching the boy
 20740	who was in a high fever. These last days, mistrusting their household
 20741	doctor and expecting another for whom they had sent to town, they had
 20742	been trying first one remedy and then another. Worn out by sleeplessness
 20743	and anxiety they threw their burden of sorrow on one another and
 20744	reproached and disputed with each other.
 20745	
 20746	âPÃ©trusha has come with papers from your father,â whispered the
 20747	maid.
 20748	
 20749	Prince Andrew went out.
 20750	
 20751	âDevil take them!â he muttered, and after listening to the verbal
 20752	instructions his father had sent and taking the correspondence and his
 20753	fatherâs letter, he returned to the nursery.
 20754	
 20755	âWell?â he asked.
 20756	
 20757	âStill the same. Wait, for heavenâs sake. Karl IvÃ¡nich always says
 20758	that sleep is more important than anything,â whispered Princess Mary
 20759	with a sigh.
 20760	
 20761	Prince Andrew went up to the child and felt him. He was burning hot.
 20762	
 20763	âConfound you and your Karl IvÃ¡nich!â He took the glass with the
 20764	drops and again went up to the cot.
 20765	
 20766	âAndrew, donât!â said Princess Mary.
 20767	
 20768	But he scowled at her angrily though also with suffering in his eyes,
 20769	and stooped glass in hand over the infant.
 20770	
 20771	âBut I wish it,â he said. âI beg youâgive it him!â
 20772	
 20773	Princess Mary shrugged her shoulders but took the glass submissively
 20774	and calling the nurse began giving the medicine. The child screamed
 20775	hoarsely. Prince Andrew winced and, clutching his head, went out and sat
 20776	down on a sofa in the next room.
 20777	
 20778	He still had all the letters in his hand. Opening them mechanically he
 20779	began reading. The old prince, now and then using abbreviations, wrote
 20780	in his large elongated hand on blue paper as follows:
 20781	
 20782	Have just this moment received by special messenger very joyful
 20783	newsâif itâs not false. Bennigsen seems to have obtained a complete
 20784	victory over Buonaparte at Eylau. In Petersburg everyone is rejoicing,
 20785	and the rewards sent to the army are innumerable. Though he is a
 20786	GermanâI congratulate him! I canât make out what the commander at
 20787	KÃ³rchevoâa certain KhandrikÃ³vâis up to; till now the additional
 20788	men and provisions have not arrived. Gallop off to him at once and
 20789	say Iâll have his head off if everything is not here in a week.
 20790	Have received another letter about the Preussisch-Eylau battle
 20791	from PÃ©tenkaâhe took part in itâand itâs all true. When
 20792	mischief-makers donât meddle even a German beats Buonaparte. He is
 20793	said to be fleeing in great disorder. Mind you gallop off to KÃ³rchevo
 20794	without delay and carry out instructions!
 20795	
 20796	Prince Andrew sighed and broke the seal of another envelope. It was
 20797	a closely written letter of two sheets from BilÃ­bin. He folded it up
 20798	without reading it and reread his fatherâs letter, ending with the
 20799	words: âGallop off to KÃ³rchevo and carry out instructions!â
 20800	
 20801	âNo, pardon me, I wonât go now till the child is better,â thought
 20802	he, going to the door and looking into the nursery.
 20803	
 20804	Princess Mary was still standing by the cot, gently rocking the baby.
 20805	
 20806	âAh yes, and what else did he say thatâs unpleasant?â thought
 20807	Prince Andrew, recalling his fatherâs letter. âYes, we have gained
 20808	a victory over Bonaparte, just when Iâm not serving. Yes, yes, heâs
 20809	always poking fun at me.... Ah, well! Let him!â And he began reading
 20810	BilÃ­binâs letter which was written in French. He read without
 20811	understanding half of it, read only to forget, if but for a moment, what
 20812	he had too long been thinking of so painfully to the exclusion of all
 20813	else.
 20814	
 20815	
 20816	
 20817	
 20818	
 20819	CHAPTER IX
 20820	
 20821	BilÃ­bin was now at army headquarters in a diplomatic capacity, and
 20822	though he wrote in French and used French jests and French idioms,
 20823	he described the whole campaign with a fearless self-censure and
 20824	self-derision genuinely Russian. BilÃ­bin wrote that the obligation of
 20825	diplomatic discretion tormented him, and he was happy to have in Prince
 20826	Andrew a reliable correspondent to whom he could pour out the bile he
 20827	had accumulated at the sight of all that was being done in the army.
 20828	The letter was old, having been written before the battle at
 20829	Preussisch-Eylau.
 20830	
 20831	âSince the day of our brilliant success at Austerlitz,â wrote
 20832	BilÃ­bin, âas you know, my dear prince, I never leave headquarters. I
 20833	have certainly acquired a taste for war, and it is just as well for me;
 20834	what I have seen during these last three months is incredible.
 20835	
 20836	âI begin ab ovo. âThe enemy of the human race,â as you know,
 20837	attacks the Prussians. The Prussians are our faithful allies who have
 20838	only betrayed us three times in three years. We take up their cause, but
 20839	it turns out that âthe enemy of the human raceâ pays no heed to
 20840	our fine speeches and in his rude and savage way throws himself on the
 20841	Prussians without giving them time to finish the parade they had begun,
 20842	and in two twists of the hand he breaks them to smithereens and installs
 20843	himself in the palace at Potsdam.
 20844	
 20845	ââI most ardently desire,â writes the King of Prussia to
 20846	Bonaparte, âthat Your Majesty should be received and treated in my
 20847	palace in a manner agreeable to yourself, and in so far as circumstances
 20848	allowed, I have hastened to take all steps to that end. May I have
 20849	succeeded!â The Prussian generals pride themselves on being polite to
 20850	the French and lay down their arms at the first demand.
 20851	
 20852	âThe head of the garrison at Glogau, with ten thousand men, asks the
 20853	King of Prussia what he is to do if he is summoned to surrender.... All
 20854	this is absolutely true.
 20855	
 20856	âIn short, hoping to settle matters by taking up a warlike attitude,
 20857	it turns out that we have landed ourselves in war, and what is more,
 20858	in war on our own frontiers, with and for the King of Prussia. We have
 20859	everything in perfect order, only one little thing is lacking, namely,
 20860	a commander in chief. As it was considered that the Austerlitz success
 20861	might have been more decisive had the commander in chief not been so
 20862	young, all our octogenarians were reviewed, and of ProzorÃ³vski
 20863	and KÃ¡menski the latter was preferred. The general comes to us,
 20864	SuvÃ³rov-like, in a kibÃ­tka, and is received with acclamations of joy
 20865	and triumph.
 20866	
 20867	âOn the 4th, the first courier arrives from Petersburg. The mails
 20868	are taken to the field marshalâs room, for he likes to do everything
 20869	himself. I am called in to help sort the letters and take those meant
 20870	for us. The field marshal looks on and waits for letters addressed
 20871	to him. We search, but none are to be found. The field marshal grows
 20872	impatient and sets to work himself and finds letters from the Emperor
 20873	to Count T., Prince V., and others. Then he bursts into one of his wild
 20874	furies and rages at everyone and everything, seizes the letters, opens
 20875	them, and reads those from the Emperor addressed to others. âAh! So
 20876	thatâs the way they treat me! No confidence in me! Ah, ordered to keep
 20877	an eye on me! Very well then! Get along with you!â So he writes the
 20878	famous order of the day to General Bennigsen:
 20879	
 20880	ââI am wounded and cannot ride and consequently cannot command the
 20881	army. You have brought your army corps to PultÃºsk, routed: here it is
 20882	exposed, and without fuel or forage, so something must be done, and, as
 20883	you yourself reported to Count BuxhÃ¶wden yesterday, you must think of
 20884	retreating to our frontierâwhich do today.â
 20885	
 20886	ââFrom all my riding,â he writes to the Emperor, âI have got a
 20887	saddle sore which, coming after all my previous journeys, quite prevents
 20888	my riding and commanding so vast an army, so I have passed on the
 20889	command to the general next in seniority, Count BuxhÃ¶wden, having sent
 20890	him my whole staff and all that belongs to it, advising him if there is
 20891	a lack of bread, to move farther into the interior of Prussia, for only
 20892	one dayâs ration of bread remains, and in some regiments none at all,
 20893	as reported by the division commanders, Ostermann and SedmorÃ©tzki, and
 20894	all that the peasants had has been eaten up. I myself will remain in
 20895	hospital at Ostrolenka till I recover. In regard to which I humbly
 20896	submit my report, with the information that if the army remains in its
 20897	present bivouac another fortnight there will not be a healthy man left
 20898	in it by spring.
 20899	
 20900	ââGrant leave to retire to his country seat to an old man who is
 20901	already in any case dishonored by being unable to fulfill the great and
 20902	glorious task for which he was chosen. I shall await your most gracious
 20903	permission here in hospital, that I may not have to play the part of a
 20904	secretary rather than commander in the army. My removal from the army
 20905	does not produce the slightest stirâa blind man has left it. There are
 20906	thousands such as I in Russia.â
 20907	
 20908	âThe field marshal is angry with the Emperor and he punishes us all,
 20909	isnât it logical?
 20910	
 20911	âThis is the first act. Those that follow are naturally increasingly
 20912	interesting and entertaining. After the field marshalâs departure
 20913	it appears that we are within sight of the enemy and must give battle.
 20914	BuxhÃ¶wden is commander in chief by seniority, but General Bennigsen
 20915	does not quite see it; more particularly as it is he and his corps who
 20916	are within sight of the enemy and he wishes to profit by the opportunity
 20917	to fight a battle âon his own handâ as the Germans say. He does so.
 20918	This is the battle of PultÃºsk, which is considered a great victory but
 20919	in my opinion was nothing of the kind. We civilians, as you know, have
 20920	a very bad way of deciding whether a battle was won or lost. Those who
 20921	retreat after a battle have lost it is what we say; and according to
 20922	that it is we who lost the battle of PultÃºsk. In short, we retreat
 20923	after the battle but send a courier to Petersburg with news of a
 20924	victory, and General Bennigsen, hoping to receive from Petersburg the
 20925	post of commander in chief as a reward for his victory, does not give up
 20926	the command of the army to General BuxhÃ¶wden. During this interregnum
 20927	we begin a very original and interesting series of maneuvers. Our aim is
 20928	no longer, as it should be, to avoid or attack the enemy, but solely to
 20929	avoid General BuxhÃ¶wden who by right of seniority should be our chief.
 20930	So energetically do we pursue this aim that after crossing an unfordable
 20931	river we burn the bridges to separate ourselves from our enemy, who at
 20932	the moment is not Bonaparte but BuxhÃ¶wden. General BuxhÃ¶wden was all
 20933	but attacked and captured by a superior enemy force as a result of one
 20934	of these maneuvers that enabled us to escape him. BuxhÃ¶wden pursues
 20935	usâwe scuttle. He hardly crosses the river to our side before we
 20936	recross to the other. At last our enemy, BuxhÃ¶wden, catches us and
 20937	attacks. Both generals are angry, and the result is a challenge on
 20938	BuxhÃ¶wdenâs part and an epileptic fit on Bennigsenâs. But at the
 20939	critical moment the courier who carried the news of our victory at
 20940	PultÃºsk to Petersburg returns bringing our appointment as commander in
 20941	chief, and our first foe, BuxhÃ¶wden, is vanquished; we can now turn
 20942	our thoughts to the second, Bonaparte. But as it turns out, just at
 20943	that moment a third enemy rises before usânamely the Orthodox Russian
 20944	soldiers, loudly demanding bread, meat, biscuits, fodder, and whatnot!
 20945	The stores are empty, the roads impassable. The Orthodox begin looting,
 20946	and in a way of which our last campaign can give you no idea. Half the
 20947	regiments form bands and scour the countryside and put everything
 20948	to fire and sword. The inhabitants are totally ruined, the hospitals
 20949	overflow with sick, and famine is everywhere. Twice the marauders even
 20950	attack our headquarters, and the commander in chief has to ask for a
 20951	battalion to disperse them. During one of these attacks they carried off
 20952	my empty portmanteau and my dressing gown. The Emperor proposes to give
 20953	all commanders of divisions the right to shoot marauders, but I much
 20954	fear this will oblige one half the army to shoot the other.â
 20955	
 20956	At first Prince Andrew read with his eyes only, but after a while,
 20957	in spite of himself (although he knew how far it was safe to trust
 20958	BilÃ­bin), what he had read began to interest him more and more. When he
 20959	had read thus far, he crumpled the letter up and threw it away. It was
 20960	not what he had read that vexed him, but the fact that the life out
 20961	there in which he had now no part could perturb him. He shut his eyes,
 20962	rubbed his forehead as if to rid himself of all interest in what he
 20963	had read, and listened to what was passing in the nursery. Suddenly he
 20964	thought he heard a strange noise through the door. He was seized with
 20965	alarm lest something should have happened to the child while he was
 20966	reading the letter. He went on tiptoe to the nursery door and opened it.
 20967	
 20968	Just as he went in he saw that the nurse was hiding something from him
 20969	with a scared look and that Princess Mary was no longer by the cot.
 20970	
 20971	âMy dear,â he heard what seemed to him her despairing whisper behind
 20972	him.
 20973	
 20974	As often happens after long sleeplessness and long anxiety, he was
 20975	seized by an unreasoning panicâit occurred to him that the child was
 20976	dead. All that he saw and heard seemed to confirm this terror.
 20977	
 20978	âAll is over,â he thought, and a cold sweat broke out on his
 20979	forehead. He went to the cot in confusion, sure that he would find it
 20980	empty and that the nurse had been hiding the dead baby. He drew the
 20981	curtain aside and for some time his frightened, restless eyes could not
 20982	find the baby. At last he saw him: the rosy boy had tossed about till he
 20983	lay across the bed with his head lower than the pillow, and was smacking
 20984	his lips in his sleep and breathing evenly.
 20985	
 20986	Prince Andrew was as glad to find the boy like that, as if he had
 20987	already lost him. He bent over him and, as his sister had taught him,
 20988	tried with his lips whether the child was still feverish. The soft
 20989	forehead was moist. Prince Andrew touched the head with his hand; even
 20990	the hair was wet, so profusely had the child perspired. He was not dead,
 20991	but evidently the crisis was over and he was convalescent. Prince Andrew
 20992	longed to snatch up, to squeeze, to hold to his heart, this helpless
 20993	little creature, but dared not do so. He stood over him, gazing at his
 20994	head and at the little arms and legs which showed under the blanket. He
 20995	heard a rustle behind him and a shadow appeared under the curtain of
 20996	the cot. He did not look round, but still gazing at the infantâs face
 20997	listened to his regular breathing. The dark shadow was Princess Mary,
 20998	who had come up to the cot with noiseless steps, lifted the curtain,
 20999	and dropped it again behind her. Prince Andrew recognized her without
 21000	looking and held out his hand to her. She pressed it.
 21001	
 21002	âHe has perspired,â said Prince Andrew.
 21003	
 21004	âI was coming to tell you so.â
 21005	
 21006	The child moved slightly in his sleep, smiled, and rubbed his forehead
 21007	against the pillow.
 21008	
 21009	Prince Andrew looked at his sister. In the dim shadow of the curtain her
 21010	luminous eyes shone more brightly than usual from the tears of joy that
 21011	were in them. She leaned over to her brother and kissed him, slightly
 21012	catching the curtain of the cot. Each made the other a warning gesture
 21013	and stood still in the dim light beneath the curtain as if not wishing
 21014	to leave that seclusion where they three were shut off from all the
 21015	world. Prince Andrew was the first to move away, ruffling his hair
 21016	against the muslin of the curtain.
 21017	
 21018	âYes, this is the one thing left me now,â he said with a sigh.
 21019	
 21020

 21023	
 21024	CHAPTER X
 21025	
 21026	Soon after his admission to the Masonic Brotherhood, Pierre went to the
 21027	Kiev province, where he had the greatest number of serfs, taking with
 21028	him full directions which he had written down for his own guidance as to
 21029	what he should do on his estates.
 21030	
 21031	When he reached Kiev he sent for all his stewards to the head office
 21032	and explained to them his intentions and wishes. He told them that steps
 21033	would be taken immediately to free his serfsâand that till then they
 21034	were not to be overburdened with labor, women while nursing their babies
 21035	were not to be sent to work, assistance was to be given to the serfs,
 21036	punishments were to be admonitory and not corporal, and hospitals,
 21037	asylums, and schools were to be established on all the estates. Some of
 21038	the stewards (there were semiliterate foremen among them) listened with
 21039	alarm, supposing these words to mean that the young count was displeased
 21040	with their management and embezzlement of money, some after their first
 21041	fright were amused by Pierreâs lisp and the new words they had not
 21042	heard before, others simply enjoyed hearing how the master talked, while
 21043	the cleverest among them, including the chief steward, understood from
 21044	this speech how they could best handle the master for their own ends.
 21045	
 21046	The chief steward expressed great sympathy with Pierreâs intentions,
 21047	but remarked that besides these changes it would be necessary to go into
 21048	the general state of affairs which was far from satisfactory.
 21049	
 21050	Despite Count BezÃºkhovâs enormous wealth, since he had come into an
 21051	income which was said to amount to five hundred thousand rubles a year,
 21052	Pierre felt himself far poorer than when his father had made him
 21053	an allowance of ten thousand rubles. He had a dim perception of the
 21054	following budget:
 21055	
 21056	About 80,000 went in payments on all the estates to the Land Bank, about
 21057	30,000 went for the upkeep of the estate near Moscow, the town house,
 21058	and the allowance to the three princesses; about 15,000 was given in
 21059	pensions and the same amount for asylums; 150,000 alimony was sent to
 21060	the countess; about 70,000 went for interest on debts. The building of a
 21061	new church, previously begun, had cost about 10,000 in each of the last
 21062	two years, and he did not know how the rest, about 100,000 rubles, was
 21063	spent, and almost every year he was obliged to borrow. Besides this the
 21064	chief steward wrote every year telling him of fires and bad harvests,
 21065	or of the necessity of rebuilding factories and workshops. So the first
 21066	task Pierre had to face was one for which he had very little aptitude or
 21067	inclinationâpractical business.
 21068	
 21069	He discussed estate affairs every day with his chief steward. But
 21070	he felt that this did not forward matters at all. He felt that these
 21071	consultations were detached from real affairs and did not link up with
 21072	them or make them move. On the one hand, the chief steward put the state
 21073	of things to him in the very worst light, pointing out the necessity of
 21074	paying off the debts and undertaking new activities with serf labor,
 21075	to which Pierre did not agree. On the other hand, Pierre demanded that
 21076	steps should be taken to liberate the serfs, which the steward met by
 21077	showing the necessity of first paying off the loans from the Land Bank,
 21078	and the consequent impossibility of a speedy emancipation.
 21079	
 21080	The steward did not say it was quite impossible, but suggested selling
 21081	the forests in the province of KostromÃ¡, the land lower down the river,
 21082	and the Crimean estate, in order to make it possible: all of which
 21083	operations according to him were connected with such complicated
 21084	measuresâthe removal of injunctions, petitions, permits, and so
 21085	onâthat Pierre became quite bewildered and only replied:
 21086	
 21087	âYes, yes, do so.â
 21088	
 21089	Pierre had none of the practical persistence that would have enabled him
 21090	to attend to the business himself and so he disliked it and only tried
 21091	to pretend to the steward that he was attending to it. The steward
 21092	for his part tried to pretend to the count that he considered these
 21093	consultations very valuable for the proprietor and troublesome to
 21094	himself.
 21095	
 21096	In Kiev Pierre found some people he knew, and strangers hastened to make
 21097	his acquaintance and joyfully welcomed the rich newcomer, the
 21098	largest landowner of the province. Temptations to Pierreâs greatest
 21099	weaknessâthe one to which he had confessed when admitted to the
 21100	Lodgeâwere so strong that he could not resist them. Again whole days,
 21101	weeks, and months of his life passed in as great a rush and were as much
 21102	occupied with evening parties, dinners, lunches, and balls, giving him
 21103	no time for reflection, as in Petersburg. Instead of the new life he had
 21104	hoped to lead he still lived the old life, only in new surroundings.
 21105	
 21106	Of the three precepts of Freemasonry Pierre realized that he did not
 21107	fulfill the one which enjoined every Mason to set an example of moral
 21108	life, and that of the seven virtues he lacked twoâmorality and the
 21109	love of death. He consoled himself with the thought that he fulfilled
 21110	another of the preceptsâthat of reforming the human raceâand had
 21111	other virtuesâlove of his neighbor, and especially generosity.
 21112	
 21113	In the spring of 1807 he decided to return to Petersburg. On the way he
 21114	intended to visit all his estates and see for himself how far his orders
 21115	had been carried out and in what state were the serfs whom God had
 21116	entrusted to his care and whom he intended to benefit.
 21117	
 21118	The chief steward, who considered the young countâs attempts almost
 21119	insaneâunprofitable to himself, to the count, and to the serfsâmade
 21120	some concessions. Continuing to represent the liberation of the serfs
 21121	as impracticable, he arranged for the erection of large
 21122	buildingsâschools, hospitals, and asylumsâon all the estates
 21123	before the master arrived. Everywhere preparations were made not for
 21124	ceremonious welcomes (which he knew Pierre would not like), but for just
 21125	such gratefully religious ones, with offerings of icons and the bread
 21126	and salt of hospitality, as, according to his understanding of his
 21127	master, would touch and delude him.
 21128	
 21129	The southern spring, the comfortable rapid traveling in a Vienna
 21130	carriage, and the solitude of the road, all had a gladdening effect on
 21131	Pierre. The estates he had not before visited were each more picturesque
 21132	than the other; the serfs everywhere seemed thriving and touchingly
 21133	grateful for the benefits conferred on them. Everywhere were receptions,
 21134	which though they embarrassed Pierre awakened a joyful feeling in the
 21135	depth of his heart. In one place the peasants presented him with bread
 21136	and salt and an icon of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, asking permission,
 21137	as a mark of their gratitude for the benefits he had conferred on them,
 21138	to build a new chantry to the church at their own expense in honor
 21139	of Peter and Paul, his patron saints. In another place the women with
 21140	infants in arms met him to thank him for releasing them from hard
 21141	work. On a third estate the priest, bearing a cross, came to meet
 21142	him surrounded by children whom, by the countâs generosity, he was
 21143	instructing in reading, writing, and religion. On all his estates Pierre
 21144	saw with his own eyes brick buildings erected or in course of erection,
 21145	all on one plan, for hospitals, schools, and almshouses, which were soon
 21146	to be opened. Everywhere he saw the stewardsâ accounts, according to
 21147	which the serfsâ manorial labor had been diminished, and heard the
 21148	touching thanks of deputations of serfs in their full-skirted blue
 21149	coats.
 21150	
 21151	What Pierre did not know was that the place where they presented him
 21152	with bread and salt and wished to build a chantry in honor of Peter and
 21153	Paul was a market village where a fair was held on St. Peterâs day,
 21154	and that the richest peasants (who formed the deputation) had begun
 21155	the chantry long before, but that nine tenths of the peasants in that
 21156	villages were in a state of the greatest poverty. He did not know that
 21157	since the nursing mothers were no longer sent to work on his land, they
 21158	did still harder work on their own land. He did not know that the priest
 21159	who met him with the cross oppressed the peasants by his exactions, and
 21160	that the pupilsâ parents wept at having to let him take their children
 21161	and secured their release by heavy payments. He did not know that the
 21162	brick buildings, built to plan, were being built by serfs whose manorial
 21163	labor was thus increased, though lessened on paper. He did not know
 21164	that where the steward had shown him in the accounts that the serfsâ
 21165	payments had been diminished by a third, their obligatory manorial work
 21166	had been increased by a half. And so Pierre was delighted with his visit
 21167	to his estates and quite recovered the philanthropic mood in which
 21168	he had left Petersburg, and wrote enthusiastic letters to his
 21169	âbrother-instructorâ as he called the Grand Master.
 21170	
 21171	âHow easy it is, how little effort it needs, to do so much good,â
 21172	thought Pierre, âand how little attention we pay to it!â
 21173	
 21174	He was pleased at the gratitude he received, but felt abashed at
 21175	receiving it. This gratitude reminded him of how much more he might do
 21176	for these simple, kindly people.
 21177	
 21178	The chief steward, a very stupid but cunning man who saw perfectly
 21179	through the naÃ¯ve and intelligent count and played with him as with
 21180	a toy, seeing the effect these prearranged receptions had on Pierre,
 21181	pressed him still harder with proofs of the impossibility and above all
 21182	the uselessness of freeing the serfs, who were quite happy as it was.
 21183	
 21184	Pierre in his secret soul agreed with the steward that it would be
 21185	difficult to imagine happier people, and that God only knew what would
 21186	happen to them when they were free, but he insisted, though reluctantly,
 21187	on what he thought right. The steward promised to do all in his power to
 21188	carry out the countâs wishes, seeing clearly that not only would the
 21189	count never be able to find out whether all measures had been taken for
 21190	the sale of the land and forests and to release them from the Land Bank,
 21191	but would probably never even inquire and would never know that the
 21192	newly erected buildings were standing empty and that the serfs continued
 21193	to give in money and work all that other peopleâs serfs gaveâthat is
 21194	to say, all that could be got out of them.
 21195	
 21196	
 21197	
 21198	
 21199	
 21200	CHAPTER XI
 21201	
 21202	Returning from his journey through South Russia in the happiest state
 21203	of mind, Pierre carried out an intention he had long had of visiting his
 21204	friend BolkÃ³nski, whom he had not seen for two years.
 21205	
 21206	BoguchÃ¡rovo lay in a flat uninteresting part of the country among
 21207	fields and forests of fir and birch, which were partly cut down. The
 21208	house lay behind a newly dug pond filled with water to the brink and
 21209	with banks still bare of grass. It was at the end of a village that
 21210	stretched along the highroad in the midst of a young copse in which were
 21211	a few fir trees.
 21212	
 21213	The homestead consisted of a threshing floor, outhouses, stables, a
 21214	bathhouse, a lodge, and a large brick house with semicircular faÃ§ade
 21215	still in course of construction. Round the house was a garden newly laid
 21216	out. The fences and gates were new and solid; two fire pumps and a
 21217	water cart, painted green, stood in a shed; the paths were straight,
 21218	the bridges were strong and had handrails. Everything bore an impress of
 21219	tidiness and good management. Some domestic serfs Pierre met, in reply
 21220	to inquiries as to where the prince lived, pointed out a small newly
 21221	built lodge close to the pond. AntÃ³n, a man who had looked after Prince
 21222	Andrew in his boyhood, helped Pierre out of his carriage, said that the
 21223	prince was at home, and showed him into a clean little anteroom.
 21224	
 21225	Pierre was struck by the modesty of the small though clean house after
 21226	the brilliant surroundings in which he had last met his friend in
 21227	Petersburg.
 21228	
 21229	He quickly entered the small reception room with its still-unplastered
 21230	wooden walls redolent of pine, and would have gone farther, but AntÃ³n
 21231	ran ahead on tiptoe and knocked at a door.
 21232	
 21233	âWell, what is it?â came a sharp, unpleasant voice.
 21234	
 21235	âA visitor,â answered AntÃ³n.
 21236	
 21237	âAsk him to wait,â and the sound was heard of a chair being pushed
 21238	back.
 21239	
 21240	Pierre went with rapid steps to the door and suddenly came face to
 21241	face with Prince Andrew, who came out frowning and looking old. Pierre
 21242	embraced him and lifting his spectacles kissed his friend on the cheek
 21243	and looked at him closely.
 21244	
 21245	âWell, I did not expect you, I am very glad,â said Prince Andrew.
 21246	
 21247	Pierre said nothing; he looked fixedly at his friend with surprise. He
 21248	was struck by the change in him. His words were kindly and there was a
 21249	smile on his lips and face, but his eyes were dull and lifeless and in
 21250	spite of his evident wish to do so he could not give them a joyous
 21251	and glad sparkle. Prince Andrew had grown thinner, paler, and more
 21252	manly-looking, but what amazed and estranged Pierre till he got used
 21253	to it were his inertia and a wrinkle on his brow indicating prolonged
 21254	concentration on some one thought.
 21255	
 21256	As is usually the case with people meeting after a prolonged separation,
 21257	it was long before their conversation could settle on anything. They
 21258	put questions and gave brief replies about things they knew ought to
 21259	be talked over at length. At last the conversation gradually settled on
 21260	some of the topics at first lightly touched on: their past life, plans
 21261	for the future, Pierreâs journeys and occupations, the war, and so
 21262	on. The preoccupation and despondency which Pierre had noticed in his
 21263	friendâs look was now still more clearly expressed in the smile
 21264	with which he listened to Pierre, especially when he spoke with joyful
 21265	animation of the past or the future. It was as if Prince Andrew would
 21266	have liked to sympathize with what Pierre was saying, but could not.
 21267	The latter began to feel that it was in bad taste to speak of his
 21268	enthusiasms, dreams, and hopes of happiness or goodness, in Prince
 21269	Andrewâs presence. He was ashamed to express his new Masonic views,
 21270	which had been particularly revived and strengthened by his late tour.
 21271	He checked himself, fearing to seem naÃ¯ve, yet he felt an irresistible
 21272	desire to show his friend as soon as possible that he was now a quite
 21273	different, and better, Pierre than he had been in Petersburg.
 21274	
 21275	âI canât tell you how much I have lived through since then. I hardly
 21276	know myself again.â
 21277	
 21278	âYes, we have altered much, very much, since then,â said Prince
 21279	Andrew.
 21280	
 21281	âWell, and you? What are your plans?â
 21282	
 21283	âPlans!â repeated Prince Andrew ironically. âMy plans?â he said,
 21284	as if astonished at the word. âWell, you see, Iâm building. I mean
 21285	to settle here altogether next year....â
 21286	
 21287	Pierre looked silently and searchingly into Prince Andrewâs face,
 21288	which had grown much older.
 21289	
 21290	âNo, I meant to ask...â Pierre began, but Prince Andrew interrupted
 21291	him.
 21292	
 21293	âBut why talk of me?... Talk to me, yes, tell me about your travels
 21294	and all you have been doing on your estates.â
 21295	
 21296	Pierre began describing what he had done on his estates, trying as far
 21297	as possible to conceal his own part in the improvements that had been
 21298	made. Prince Andrew several times prompted Pierreâs story of what he
 21299	had been doing, as though it were all an old-time story, and he listened
 21300	not only without interest but even as if ashamed of what Pierre was
 21301	telling him.
 21302	
 21303	Pierre felt uncomfortable and even depressed in his friendâs company
 21304	and at last became silent.
 21305	
 21306	âIâll tell you what, my dear fellow,â said Prince Andrew, who
 21307	evidently also felt depressed and constrained with his visitor, âI am
 21308	only bivouacking here and have just come to look round. I am going back
 21309	to my sister today. I will introduce you to her. But of course you know
 21310	her already,â he said, evidently trying to entertain a visitor with
 21311	whom he now found nothing in common. âWe will go after dinner. And
 21312	would you now like to look round my place?â
 21313	
 21314	They went out and walked about till dinnertime, talking of the political
 21315	news and common acquaintances like people who do not know each other
 21316	intimately. Prince Andrew spoke with some animation and interest only of
 21317	the new homestead he was constructing and its buildings, but even here,
 21318	while on the scaffolding, in the midst of a talk explaining the future
 21319	arrangements of the house, he interrupted himself:
 21320	
 21321	âHowever, this is not at all interesting. Let us have dinner, and then
 21322	weâll set off.â
 21323	
 21324	At dinner, conversation turned on Pierreâs marriage.
 21325	
 21326	âI was very much surprised when I heard of it,â said Prince Andrew.
 21327	
 21328	Pierre blushed, as he always did when it was mentioned, and said
 21329	hurriedly: âI will tell you some time how it all happened. But you
 21330	know it is all over, and forever.â
 21331	
 21332	âForever?â said Prince Andrew. âNothingâs forever.â
 21333	
 21334	âBut you know how it all ended, donât you? You heard of the duel?â
 21335	
 21336	âAnd so you had to go through that too!â
 21337	
 21338	âOne thing I thank God for is that I did not kill that man,â said
 21339	Pierre.
 21340	
 21341	âWhy so?â asked Prince Andrew. âTo kill a vicious dog is a very
 21342	good thing really.â
 21343	
 21344	âNo, to kill a man is badâwrong.â
 21345	
 21346	âWhy is it wrong?â urged Prince Andrew. âIt is not given to man
 21347	to know what is right and what is wrong. Men always did and always will
 21348	err, and in nothing more than in what they consider right and wrong.â
 21349	
 21350	âWhat does harm to another is wrong,â said Pierre, feeling with
 21351	pleasure that for the first time since his arrival Prince Andrew was
 21352	roused, had begun to talk, and wanted to express what had brought him to
 21353	his present state.
 21354	
 21355	âAnd who has told you what is bad for another man?â he asked.
 21356	
 21357	âBad! Bad!â exclaimed Pierre. âWe all know what is bad for
 21358	ourselves.â
 21359	
 21360	âYes, we know that, but the harm I am conscious of in myself is
 21361	something I cannot inflict on others,â said Prince Andrew, growing
 21362	more and more animated and evidently wishing to express his new outlook
 21363	to Pierre. He spoke in French. âI only know two very real evils in
 21364	life: remorse and illness. The only good is the absence of those evils.
 21365	To live for myself avoiding those two evils is my whole philosophy
 21366	now.â
 21367	
 21368	âAnd love of oneâs neighbor, and self-sacrifice?â began Pierre.
 21369	âNo, I canât agree with you! To live only so as not to do evil and
 21370	not to have to repent is not enough. I lived like that, I lived for
 21371	myself and ruined my life. And only now when I am living, or at least
 21372	tryingâ (Pierreâs modesty made him correct himself) âto live for
 21373	others, only now have I understood all the happiness of life. No, I
 21374	shall not agree with you, and you do not really believe what you are
 21375	saying.â Prince Andrew looked silently at Pierre with an ironic smile.
 21376	
 21377	âWhen you see my sister, Princess Mary, youâll get on with her,â
 21378	he said. âPerhaps you are right for yourself,â he added after
 21379	a short pause, âbut everyone lives in his own way. You lived for
 21380	yourself and say you nearly ruined your life and only found happiness
 21381	when you began living for others. I experienced just the reverse. I
 21382	lived for glory.âAnd after all what is glory? The same love of others,
 21383	a desire to do something for them, a desire for their approval.âSo I
 21384	lived for others, and not almost, but quite, ruined my life. And I have
 21385	become calmer since I began to live only for myself.â
 21386	
 21387	âBut what do you mean by living only for yourself?â asked Pierre,
 21388	growing excited. âWhat about your son, your sister, and your
 21389	father?â
 21390	
 21391	âBut thatâs just the same as myselfâthey are not others,â
 21392	explained Prince Andrew. âThe others, oneâs neighbors, le prochain,
 21393	as you and Princess Mary call it, are the chief source of all error and
 21394	evil. Le prochainâyour Kiev peasants to whom you want to do good.â
 21395	
 21396	And he looked at Pierre with a mocking, challenging expression. He
 21397	evidently wished to draw him on.
 21398	
 21399	âYou are joking,â replied Pierre, growing more and more excited.
 21400	âWhat error or evil can there be in my wishing to do good, and even
 21401	doing a littleâthough I did very little and did it very badly? What
 21402	evil can there be in it if unfortunate people, our serfs, people like
 21403	ourselves, were growing up and dying with no idea of God and truth
 21404	beyond ceremonies and meaningless prayers and are now instructed in
 21405	a comforting belief in future life, retribution, recompense, and
 21406	consolation? What evil and error are there in it, if people were dying
 21407	of disease without help while material assistance could so easily be
 21408	rendered, and I supplied them with a doctor, a hospital, and an asylum
 21409	for the aged? And is it not a palpable, unquestionable good if a
 21410	peasant, or a woman with a baby, has no rest day or night and I give
 21411	them rest and leisure?â said Pierre, hurrying and lisping. âAnd
 21412	I have done that though badly and to a small extent; but I have done
 21413	something toward it and you cannot persuade me that it was not a good
 21414	action, and more than that, you canât make me believe that you do not
 21415	think so yourself. And the main thing is,â he continued, âthat I
 21416	know, and know for certain, that the enjoyment of doing this good is the
 21417	only sure happiness in life.â
 21418	
 21419	âYes, if you put it like that itâs quite a different matter,â said
 21420	Prince Andrew. âI build a house and lay out a garden, and you build
 21421	hospitals. The one and the other may serve as a pastime. But whatâs
 21422	right and whatâs good must be judged by one who knows all, but not by
 21423	us. Well, you want an argument,â he added, âcome on then.â
 21424	
 21425	They rose from the table and sat down in the entrance porch which served
 21426	as a veranda.
 21427	
 21428	âCome, letâs argue then,â said Prince Andrew, âYou talk of
 21429	schools,â he went on, crooking a finger, âeducation and so forth;
 21430	that is, you want to raise himâ (pointing to a peasant who passed by
 21431	them taking off his cap) âfrom his animal condition and awaken in him
 21432	spiritual needs, while it seems to me that animal happiness is the only
 21433	happiness possible, and that is just what you want to deprive him of.
 21434	I envy him, but you want to make him what I am, without giving him my
 21435	means. Then you say, âlighten his toil.â But as I see it, physical
 21436	labor is as essential to him, as much a condition of his existence, as
 21437	mental activity is to you or me. You canât help thinking. I go to bed
 21438	after two in the morning, thoughts come and I canât sleep but toss
 21439	about till dawn, because I think and canât help thinking, just as
 21440	he canât help plowing and mowing; if he didnât, he would go to the
 21441	drink shop or fall ill. Just as I could not stand his terrible physical
 21442	labor but should die of it in a week, so he could not stand my physical
 21443	idleness, but would grow fat and die. The third thingâwhat else was
 21444	it you talked about?â and Prince Andrew crooked a third finger. âAh,
 21445	yes, hospitals, medicine. He has a fit, he is dying, and you come and
 21446	bleed him and patch him up. He will drag about as a cripple, a burden to
 21447	everybody, for another ten years. It would be far easier and simpler for
 21448	him to die. Others are being born and there are plenty of them as it is.
 21449	It would be different if you grudged losing a laborerâthatâs how I
 21450	regard himâbut you want to cure him from love of him. And he does not
 21451	want that. And besides, what a notion that medicine ever cured anyone!
 21452	Killed them, yes!â said he, frowning angrily and turning away from
 21453	Pierre.
 21454	
 21455	Prince Andrew expressed his ideas so clearly and distinctly that it was
 21456	evident he had reflected on this subject more than once, and he spoke
 21457	readily and rapidly like a man who has not talked for a long time. His
 21458	glance became more animated as his conclusions became more hopeless.
 21459	
 21460	âOh, that is dreadful, dreadful!â said Pierre. âI donât
 21461	understand how one can live with such ideas. I had such moments
 21462	myself not long ago, in Moscow and when traveling, but at such times I
 21463	collapsed so that I donât live at allâeverything seems hateful to
 21464	me... myself most of all. Then I donât eat, donât wash... and how is
 21465	it with you?...â
 21466	
 21467	âWhy not wash? That is not cleanly,â said Prince Andrew; âon the
 21468	contrary one must try to make oneâs life as pleasant as possible.
 21469	Iâm alive, that is not my fault, so I must live out my life as best I
 21470	can without hurting others.â
 21471	
 21472	âBut with such ideas what motive have you for living? One would sit
 21473	without moving, undertaking nothing....â
 21474	
 21475	âLife as it is leaves one no peace. I should be thankful to do
 21476	nothing, but here on the one hand the local nobility have done me the
 21477	honor to choose me to be their marshal; it was all I could do to get
 21478	out of it. They could not understand that I have not the necessary
 21479	qualifications for itâthe kind of good-natured, fussy shallowness
 21480	necessary for the position. Then thereâs this house, which must be
 21481	built in order to have a nook of oneâs own in which to be quiet. And
 21482	now thereâs this recruiting.â
 21483	
 21484	âWhy arenât you serving in the army?â
 21485	
 21486	âAfter Austerlitz!â said Prince Andrew gloomily. âNo, thank you
 21487	very much! I have promised myself not to serve again in the active
 21488	Russian army. And I wonâtânot even if Bonaparte were here at
 21489	SmolÃ©nsk threatening Bald Hillsâeven then I wouldnât serve in the
 21490	Russian army! Well, as I was saying,â he continued, recovering his
 21491	composure, ânow thereâs this recruiting. My father is chief in
 21492	command of the Third District, and my only way of avoiding active
 21493	service is to serve under him.â
 21494	
 21495	âThen you are serving?â
 21496	
 21497	âI am.â
 21498	
 21499	He paused a little while.
 21500	
 21501	âAnd why do you serve?â
 21502	
 21503	âWhy, for this reason! My father is one of the most remarkable men of
 21504	his time. But he is growing old, and though not exactly cruel he has too
 21505	energetic a character. He is so accustomed to unlimited power that he is
 21506	terrible, and now he has this authority of a commander in chief of
 21507	the recruiting, granted by the Emperor. If I had been two hours late
 21508	a fortnight ago he would have had a paymasterâs clerk at YÃºkhnovna
 21509	hanged,â said Prince Andrew with a smile. âSo I am serving because
 21510	I alone have any influence with my father, and now and then can save him
 21511	from actions which would torment him afterwards.â
 21512	
 21513	âWell, there you see!â
 21514	
 21515	âYes, but it is not as you imagine,â Prince Andrew continued. âI
 21516	did not, and do not, in the least care about that scoundrel of a clerk
 21517	who had stolen some boots from the recruits; I should even have been
 21518	very glad to see him hanged, but I was sorry for my fatherâthat again
 21519	is for myself.â
 21520	
 21521	Prince Andrew grew more and more animated. His eyes glittered feverishly
 21522	while he tried to prove to Pierre that in his actions there was no
 21523	desire to do good to his neighbor.
 21524	
 21525	âThere now, you wish to liberate your serfs,â he continued; âthat
 21526	is a very good thing, but not for youâI donât suppose you ever had
 21527	anyone flogged or sent to Siberiaâand still less for your serfs. If
 21528	they are beaten, flogged, or sent to Siberia, I donât suppose they are
 21529	any the worse off. In Siberia they lead the same animal life, and the
 21530	stripes on their bodies heal, and they are happy as before. But it is
 21531	a good thing for proprietors who perish morally, bring remorse upon
 21532	themselves, stifle this remorse and grow callous, as a result of being
 21533	able to inflict punishments justly and unjustly. It is those people I
 21534	pity, and for their sake I should like to liberate the serfs. You
 21535	may not have seen, but I have seen, how good men brought up in those
 21536	traditions of unlimited power, in time when they grow more irritable,
 21537	become cruel and harsh, are conscious of it, but cannot restrain
 21538	themselves and grow more and more miserable.â
 21539	
 21540	Prince Andrew spoke so earnestly that Pierre could not help thinking
 21541	that these thoughts had been suggested to Prince Andrew by his
 21542	fatherâs case.
 21543	
 21544	He did not reply.
 21545	
 21546	âSo thatâs what Iâm sorry forâhuman dignity, peace of mind,
 21547	purity, and not the serfsâ backs and foreheads, which, beat and shave
 21548	as you may, always remain the same backs and foreheads.â
 21549	
 21550	âNo, no! A thousand times no! I shall never agree with you,â said
 21551	Pierre.
 21552	
 21553	
 21554	
 21555	
 21556	
 21557	CHAPTER XII
 21558	
 21559	In the evening Andrew and Pierre got into the open carriage and drove to
 21560	Bald Hills. Prince Andrew, glancing at Pierre, broke the silence now and
 21561	then with remarks which showed that he was in a good temper.
 21562	
 21563	Pointing to the fields, he spoke of the improvements he was making in
 21564	his husbandry.
 21565	
 21566	Pierre remained gloomily silent, answering in monosyllables and
 21567	apparently immersed in his own thoughts.
 21568	
 21569	He was thinking that Prince Andrew was unhappy, had gone astray, did not
 21570	see the true light, and that he, Pierre, ought to aid, enlighten, and
 21571	raise him. But as soon as he thought of what he should say, he felt that
 21572	Prince Andrew with one word, one argument, would upset all his teaching,
 21573	and he shrank from beginning, afraid of exposing to possible ridicule
 21574	what to him was precious and sacred.
 21575	
 21576	âNo, but why do you think so?â Pierre suddenly began, lowering his
 21577	head and looking like a bull about to charge, âwhy do you think so?
 21578	You should not think so.â
 21579	
 21580	âThink? What about?â asked Prince Andrew with surprise.
 21581	
 21582	âAbout life, about manâs destiny. It canât be so. I myself thought
 21583	like that, and do you know what saved me? Freemasonry! No, donât
 21584	smile. Freemasonry is not a religious ceremonial sect, as I thought
 21585	it was: Freemasonry is the best expression of the best, the eternal,
 21586	aspects of humanity.â
 21587	
 21588	And he began to explain Freemasonry as he understood it to Prince
 21589	Andrew. He said that Freemasonry is the teaching of Christianity freed
 21590	from the bonds of State and Church, a teaching of equality, brotherhood,
 21591	and love.
 21592	
 21593	âOnly our holy brotherhood has the real meaning of life, all the rest
 21594	is a dream,â said Pierre. âUnderstand, my dear fellow, that outside
 21595	this union all is filled with deceit and falsehood and I agree with you
 21596	that nothing is left for an intelligent and good man but to live out
 21597	his life, like you, merely trying not to harm others. But make our
 21598	fundamental convictions your own, join our brotherhood, give yourself up
 21599	to us, let yourself be guided, and you will at once feel yourself, as I
 21600	have felt myself, a part of that vast invisible chain the beginning of
 21601	which is hidden in heaven,â said Pierre.
 21602	
 21603	Prince Andrew, looking straight in front of him, listened in silence to
 21604	Pierreâs words. More than once, when the noise of the wheels prevented
 21605	his catching what Pierre said, he asked him to repeat it, and by the
 21606	peculiar glow that came into Prince Andrewâs eyes and by his silence,
 21607	Pierre saw that his words were not in vain and that Prince Andrew would
 21608	not interrupt him or laugh at what he said.
 21609	
 21610	They reached a river that had overflowed its banks and which they had to
 21611	cross by ferry. While the carriage and horses were being placed on it,
 21612	they also stepped on the raft.
 21613	
 21614	Prince Andrew, leaning his arms on the raft railing, gazed silently at
 21615	the flooding waters glittering in the setting sun.
 21616	
 21617	âWell, what do you think about it?â Pierre asked. âWhy are you
 21618	silent?â
 21619	
 21620	âWhat do I think about it? I am listening to you. Itâs all very
 21621	well.... You say: join our brotherhood and we will show you the aim of
 21622	life, the destiny of man, and the laws which govern the world. But who
 21623	are we? Men. How is it you know everything? Why do I alone not see what
 21624	you see? You see a reign of goodness and truth on earth, but I donât
 21625	see it.â
 21626	
 21627	Pierre interrupted him.
 21628	
 21629	âDo you believe in a future life?â he asked.
 21630	
 21631	âA future life?â Prince Andrew repeated, but Pierre, giving him no
 21632	time to reply, took the repetition for a denial, the more readily as he
 21633	knew Prince Andrewâs former atheistic convictions.
 21634	
 21635	âYou say you canât see a reign of goodness and truth on earth. Nor
 21636	could I, and it cannot be seen if one looks on our life here as the end
 21637	of everything. On earth, here on this earthâ (Pierre pointed to
 21638	the fields), âthere is no truth, all is false and evil; but in the
 21639	universe, in the whole universe there is a kingdom of truth, and we who
 21640	are now the children of earth areâeternallyâchildren of the
 21641	whole universe. Donât I feel in my soul that I am part of this vast
 21642	harmonious whole? Donât I feel that I form one link, one step, between
 21643	the lower and higher beings, in this vast harmonious multitude of
 21644	beings in whom the Deityâthe Supreme Power if you prefer the termâis
 21645	manifest? If I see, clearly see, that ladder leading from plant to man,
 21646	why should I suppose it breaks off at me and does not go farther and
 21647	farther? I feel that I cannot vanish, since nothing vanishes in this
 21648	world, but that I shall always exist and always have existed. I feel
 21649	that beyond me and above me there are spirits, and that in this world
 21650	there is truth.â
 21651	
 21652	âYes, that is Herderâs theory,â said Prince Andrew, âbut it is
 21653	not that which can convince me, dear friendâlife and death are what
 21654	convince. What convinces is when one sees a being dear to one, bound
 21655	up with oneâs own life, before whom one was to blame and had hoped to
 21656	make it rightâ (Prince Andrewâs voice trembled and he turned away),
 21657	âand suddenly that being is seized with pain, suffers, and ceases to
 21658	exist.... Why? It cannot be that there is no answer. And I believe there
 21659	is.... Thatâs what convinces, that is what has convinced me,â said
 21660	Prince Andrew.
 21661	
 21662	âYes, yes, of course,â said Pierre, âisnât that what Iâm
 21663	saying?â
 21664	
 21665	âNo. All I say is that it is not argument that convinces me of the
 21666	necessity of a future life, but this: when you go hand in hand with
 21667	someone and all at once that person vanishes there, into nowhere, and
 21668	you yourself are left facing that abyss, and look in. And I have looked
 21669	in....â
 21670	
 21671	âWell, thatâs it then! You know that there is a there and there is a
 21672	Someone? There is the future life. The Someone isâGod.â
 21673	
 21674	Prince Andrew did not reply. The carriage and horses had long since been
 21675	taken off, onto the farther bank, and reharnessed. The sun had sunk half
 21676	below the horizon and an evening frost was starring the puddles near
 21677	the ferry, but Pierre and Andrew, to the astonishment of the footmen,
 21678	coachmen, and ferrymen, still stood on the raft and talked.
 21679	
 21680	âIf there is a God and future life, there is truth and good, and
 21681	manâs highest happiness consists in striving to attain them. We must
 21682	live, we must love, and we must believe that we live not only today on
 21683	this scrap of earth, but have lived and shall live forever, there, in
 21684	the Whole,â said Pierre, and he pointed to the sky.
 21685	
 21686	Prince Andrew stood leaning on the railing of the raft listening to
 21687	Pierre, and he gazed with his eyes fixed on the red reflection of the
 21688	sun gleaming on the blue waters. There was perfect stillness. Pierre
 21689	became silent. The raft had long since stopped and only the waves of the
 21690	current beat softly against it below. Prince Andrew felt as if the sound
 21691	of the waves kept up a refrain to Pierreâs words, whispering:
 21692	
 21693	âIt is true, believe it.â
 21694	
 21695	He sighed, and glanced with a radiant, childlike, tender look at
 21696	Pierreâs face, flushed and rapturous, but yet shy before his superior
 21697	friend.
 21698	
 21699	âYes, if it only were so!â said Prince Andrew. âHowever, it is
 21700	time to get on,â he added, and, stepping off the raft, he looked up
 21701	at the sky to which Pierre had pointed, and for the first time since
 21702	Austerlitz saw that high, everlasting sky he had seen while lying on
 21703	that battlefield; and something that had long been slumbering, something
 21704	that was best within him, suddenly awoke, joyful and youthful, in his
 21705	soul. It vanished as soon as he returned to the customary conditions
 21706	of his life, but he knew that this feeling which he did not know how to
 21707	develop existed within him. His meeting with Pierre formed an epoch in
 21708	Prince Andrewâs life. Though outwardly he continued to live in the
 21709	same old way, inwardly he began a new life.
 21710	
 21711	
 21712	
 21713	
 21714	
 21715	CHAPTER XIII
 21716	
 21717	It was getting dusk when Prince Andrew and Pierre drove up to the front
 21718	entrance of the house at Bald Hills. As they approached the house,
 21719	Prince Andrew with a smile drew Pierreâs attention to a commotion
 21720	going on at the back porch. A woman, bent with age, with a wallet on her
 21721	back, and a short, long-haired, young man in a black garment had rushed
 21722	back to the gate on seeing the carriage driving up. Two women ran out
 21723	after them, and all four, looking round at the carriage, ran in dismay
 21724	up the steps of the back porch.
 21725	
 21726	âThose are Maryâs âGodâs folk,ââ said Prince Andrew. âThey
 21727	have mistaken us for my father. This is the one matter in which she
 21728	disobeys him. He orders these pilgrims to be driven away, but she
 21729	receives them.â
 21730	
 21731	âBut what are âGodâs folkâ?â asked Pierre.
 21732	
 21733	Prince Andrew had no time to answer. The servants came out to meet them,
 21734	and he asked where the old prince was and whether he was expected back
 21735	soon.
 21736	
 21737	The old prince had gone to the town and was expected back any minute.
 21738	
 21739	Prince Andrew led Pierre to his own apartments, which were always kept
 21740	in perfect order and readiness for him in his fatherâs house; he
 21741	himself went to the nursery.
 21742	
 21743	âLet us go and see my sister,â he said to Pierre when he returned.
 21744	âI have not found her yet, she is hiding now, sitting with her
 21745	âGodâs folk.â It will serve her right, she will be confused, but
 21746	you will see her âGodâs folk.â Itâs really very curious.â
 21747	
 21748	âWhat are âGodâs folkâ?â asked Pierre.
 21749	
 21750	âCome, and youâll see for yourself.â
 21751	
 21752	Princess Mary really was disconcerted and red patches came on her face
 21753	when they went in. In her snug room, with lamps burning before the icon
 21754	stand, a young lad with a long nose and long hair, wearing a monkâs
 21755	cassock, sat on the sofa beside her, behind a samovar. Near them, in an
 21756	armchair, sat a thin, shriveled, old woman, with a meek expression on
 21757	her childlike face.
 21758	
 21759	âAndrew, why didnât you warn me?â said the princess, with mild
 21760	reproach, as she stood before her pilgrims like a hen before her
 21761	chickens.
 21762	
 21763	âCharmÃ©e de vous voir. Je suis trÃ¨s contente de vous voir,â * she
 21764	said to Pierre as he kissed her hand. She had known him as a child, and
 21765	now his friendship with Andrew, his misfortune with his wife, and above
 21766	all his kindly, simple face disposed her favorably toward him. She
 21767	looked at him with her beautiful radiant eyes and seemed to say, âI
 21768	like you very much, but please donât laugh at my people.â After
 21769	exchanging the first greetings, they sat down.
 21770	
 21771	    * âDelighted to see you. I am very glad to see you.â
 21772	
 21773	
 21774	âAh, and IvÃ¡nushka is here too!â said Prince Andrew, glancing with
 21775	a smile at the young pilgrim.
 21776	
 21777	âAndrew!â said Princess Mary, imploringly. âIl faut que vous
 21778	sachiez que câest une femme,â * said Prince Andrew to Pierre.
 21779	
 21780	âAndrew, au nom de Dieu!â *(2) Princess Mary repeated.
 21781	
 21782	     * âYou must know that this is a woman.â
 21783	
 21784	     * (2) âFor heavenâs sake.â
 21785	
 21786	
 21787	It was evident that Prince Andrewâs ironical tone toward the pilgrims
 21788	and Princess Maryâs helpless attempts to protect them were their
 21789	customary long-established relations on the matter.
 21790	
 21791	âMais, ma bonne amie,â said Prince Andrew, âvous devriez au
 21792	contraire mâÃªtre reconnaissante de ce que jâexplique Ã  Pierre
 21793	votre intimitÃ© avec ce jeune homme.â *
 21794	
 21795	     * âBut, my dear, you ought on the contrary to be grateful to
 21796	     me for explaining to Pierre your intimacy with this young
 21797	     man.â
 21798	
 21799	
 21800	âReally?â said Pierre, gazing over his spectacles with curiosity and
 21801	seriousness (for which Princess Mary was specially grateful to him) into
 21802	IvÃ¡nushkaâs face, who, seeing that she was being spoken about, looked
 21803	round at them all with crafty eyes.
 21804	
 21805	Princess Maryâs embarrassment on her peopleâs account was quite
 21806	unnecessary. They were not in the least abashed. The old woman, lowering
 21807	her eyes but casting side glances at the newcomers, had turned her cup
 21808	upside down and placed a nibbled bit of sugar beside it, and sat
 21809	quietly in her armchair, though hoping to be offered another cup of tea.
 21810	IvÃ¡nushka, sipping out of her saucer, looked with sly womanish eyes
 21811	from under her brows at the young men.
 21812	
 21813	âWhere have you been? To Kiev?â Prince Andrew asked the old woman.
 21814	
 21815	âI have, good sir,â she answered garrulously. âJust at
 21816	Christmastime I was deemed worthy to partake of the holy and heavenly
 21817	sacrament at the shrine of the saint. And now Iâm from KolyÃ¡zin,
 21818	master, where a great and wonderful blessing has been revealed.â
 21819	
 21820	âAnd was IvÃ¡nushka with you?â
 21821	
 21822	âI go by myself, benefactor,â said IvÃ¡nushka, trying to speak in a
 21823	bass voice. âI only came across PelagÃ©ya in YÃºkhnovo....â
 21824	
 21825	PelagÃ©ya interrupted her companion; she evidently wished to tell what
 21826	she had seen.
 21827	
 21828	âIn KolyÃ¡zin, master, a wonderful blessing has been revealed.â
 21829	
 21830	âWhat is it? Some new relics?â asked Prince Andrew.
 21831	
 21832	âAndrew, do leave off,â said Princess Mary. âDonât tell him,
 21833	PelagÃ©ya.â
 21834	
 21835	âNo... why not, my dear, why shouldnât I? I like him. He is kind,
 21836	he is one of Godâs chosen, heâs a benefactor, he once gave me ten
 21837	rubles, I remember. When I was in Kiev, Crazy Cyril says to me (heâs
 21838	one of Godâs own and goes barefoot summer and winter), he says,
 21839	âWhy are you not going to the right place? Go to KolyÃ¡zin where a
 21840	wonder-working icon of the Holy Mother of God has been revealed.â On
 21841	hearing those words I said good-by to the holy folk and went.â
 21842	
 21843	All were silent, only the pilgrim woman went on in measured tones,
 21844	drawing in her breath.
 21845	
 21846	âSo I come, master, and the people say to me: âA great blessing has
 21847	been revealed, holy oil trickles from the cheeks of our blessed Mother,
 21848	the Holy Virgin Mother of God.â...â
 21849	
 21850	âAll right, all right, you can tell us afterwards,â said Princess
 21851	Mary, flushing.
 21852	
 21853	âLet me ask her,â said Pierre. âDid you see it yourselves?â he
 21854	inquired.
 21855	
 21856	âOh, yes, master, I was found worthy. Such a brightness on the face
 21857	like the light of heaven, and from the blessed Motherâs cheek it drops
 21858	and drops....â
 21859	
 21860	âBut, dear me, that must be a fraud!â said Pierre, naÃ¯vely, who had
 21861	listened attentively to the pilgrim.
 21862	
 21863	âOh, master, what are you saying?â exclaimed the horrified
 21864	PelagÃ©ya, turning to Princess Mary for support.
 21865	
 21866	âThey impose on the people,â he repeated.
 21867	
 21868	âLord Jesus Christ!â exclaimed the pilgrim woman, crossing herself.
 21869	âOh, donât speak so, master! There was a general who did not
 21870	believe, and said, âThe monks cheat,â and as soon as heâd said it
 21871	he went blind. And he dreamed that the Holy Virgin Mother of the Kiev
 21872	catacombs came to him and said, âBelieve in me and I will make you
 21873	whole.â So he begged: âTake me to her, take me to her.â Itâs the
 21874	real truth Iâm telling you, I saw it myself. So he was brought, quite
 21875	blind, straight to her, and he goes up to her and falls down and says,
 21876	âMake me whole,â says he, âand Iâll give thee what the Tsar
 21877	bestowed on me.â I saw it myself, master, the star is fixed into the
 21878	icon. Well, and what do you think? He received his sight! Itâs a sin
 21879	to speak so. God will punish you,â she said admonishingly, turning to
 21880	Pierre.
 21881	
 21882	âHow did the star get into the icon?â Pierre asked.
 21883	
 21884	âAnd was the Holy Mother promoted to the rank of general?â said
 21885	Prince Andrew, with a smile.
 21886	
 21887	PelagÃ©ya suddenly grew quite pale and clasped her hands.
 21888	
 21889	âOh, master, master, what a sin! And you who have a son!â she began,
 21890	her pallor suddenly turning to a vivid red. âMaster, what have you
 21891	said? God forgive you!â And she crossed herself. âLord forgive him!
 21892	My dear, what does it mean?...â she asked, turning to Princess
 21893	Mary. She got up and, almost crying, began to arrange her wallet. She
 21894	evidently felt frightened and ashamed to have accepted charity in a
 21895	house where such things could be said, and was at the same time sorry to
 21896	have now to forgo the charity of this house.
 21897	
 21898	âNow, why need you do it?â said Princess Mary. âWhy did you come
 21899	to me?...â
 21900	
 21901	âCome, PelagÃ©ya, I was joking,â said Pierre. âPrincesse, ma
 21902	parole, je nâai pas voulu lâoffenser. * I did not mean anything,
 21903	I was only joking,â he said, smiling shyly and trying to efface his
 21904	offense. âIt was all my fault, and Andrew was only joking.â
 21905	
 21906	    * âPrincess, on my word, I did not wish to offend her.â
 21907	
 21908	
 21909	PelagÃ©ya stopped doubtfully, but in Pierreâs face there was such a
 21910	look of sincere penitence, and Prince Andrew glanced so meekly now at
 21911	her and now at Pierre, that she was gradually reassured.
 21912	
 21913	
 21914	
 21915	
 21916	
 21917	CHAPTER XIV
 21918	
 21919	The pilgrim woman was appeased and, being encouraged to talk, gave a
 21920	long account of Father Amphilochus, who led so holy a life that his
 21921	hands smelled of incense, and how on her last visit to Kiev some monks
 21922	she knew let her have the keys of the catacombs, and how she, taking
 21923	some dried bread with her, had spent two days in the catacombs with
 21924	the saints. âIâd pray awhile to one, ponder awhile, then go on to
 21925	another. Iâd sleep a bit and then again go and kiss the relics, and
 21926	there was such peace all around, such blessedness, that one donât want
 21927	to come out, even into the light of heaven again.â
 21928	
 21929	Pierre listened to her attentively and seriously. Prince Andrew went out
 21930	of the room, and then, leaving âGodâs folkâ to finish their tea,
 21931	Princess Mary took Pierre into the drawing room.
 21932	
 21933	âYou are very kind,â she said to him.
 21934	
 21935	âOh, I really did not mean to hurt her feelings. I understand them so
 21936	well and have the greatest respect for them.â
 21937	
 21938	Princess Mary looked at him silently and smiled affectionately.
 21939	
 21940	âI have known you a long time, you see, and am as fond of you as of a
 21941	brother,â she said. âHow do you find Andrew?â she added hurriedly,
 21942	not giving him time to reply to her affectionate words. âI am very
 21943	anxious about him. His health was better in the winter, but last spring
 21944	his wound reopened and the doctor said he ought to go away for a
 21945	cure. And I am also very much afraid for him spiritually. He has not a
 21946	character like us women who, when we suffer, can weep away our sorrows.
 21947	He keeps it all within him. Today he is cheerful and in good spirits,
 21948	but that is the effect of your visitâhe is not often like that. If
 21949	you could persuade him to go abroad. He needs activity, and this quiet
 21950	regular life is very bad for him. Others donât notice it, but I see
 21951	it.â
 21952	
 21953	Toward ten oâclock the men servants rushed to the front door, hearing
 21954	the bells of the old princeâs carriage approaching. Prince Andrew and
 21955	Pierre also went out into the porch.
 21956	
 21957	âWhoâs that?â asked the old prince, noticing Pierre as he got out
 21958	of the carriage.
 21959	
 21960	âAh! Very glad! Kiss me,â he said, having learned who the young
 21961	stranger was.
 21962	
 21963	The old prince was in a good temper and very gracious to Pierre.
 21964	
 21965	Before supper, Prince Andrew, coming back to his fatherâs study, found
 21966	him disputing hotly with his visitor. Pierre was maintaining that a time
 21967	would come when there would be no more wars. The old prince disputed it
 21968	chaffingly, but without getting angry.
 21969	
 21970	âDrain the blood from menâs veins and put in water instead, then
 21971	there will be no more war! Old womenâs nonsenseâold womenâs
 21972	nonsense!â he repeated, but still he patted Pierre affectionately
 21973	on the shoulder, and then went up to the table where Prince Andrew,
 21974	evidently not wishing to join in the conversation, was looking over the
 21975	papers his father had brought from town. The old prince went up to him
 21976	and began to talk business.
 21977	
 21978	âThe marshal, a Count RostÃ³v, hasnât sent half his contingent. He
 21979	came to town and wanted to invite me to dinnerâI gave him a pretty
 21980	dinner!... And there, look at this.... Well, my boy,â the old prince
 21981	went on, addressing his son and patting Pierre on the shoulder. âA
 21982	fine fellowâyour friendâI like him! He stirs me up. Another says
 21983	clever things and one doesnât care to listen, but this one talks
 21984	rubbish yet stirs an old fellow up. Well, go! Get along! Perhaps Iâll
 21985	come and sit with you at supper. Weâll have another dispute. Make
 21986	friends with my little fool, Princess Mary,â he shouted after Pierre,
 21987	through the door.
 21988	
 21989	Only now, on his visit to Bald Hills, did Pierre fully realize the
 21990	strength and charm of his friendship with Prince Andrew. That charm was
 21991	not expressed so much in his relations with him as with all his family
 21992	and with the household. With the stern old prince and the gentle, timid
 21993	Princess Mary, though he had scarcely known them, Pierre at once felt
 21994	like an old friend. They were all fond of him already. Not only Princess
 21995	Mary, who had been won by his gentleness with the pilgrims, gave him her
 21996	most radiant looks, but even the one-year-old âPrince Nicholasâ (as
 21997	his grandfather called him) smiled at Pierre and let himself be taken
 21998	in his arms, and Michael IvÃ¡novich and Mademoiselle Bourienne looked at
 21999	him with pleasant smiles when he talked to the old prince.
 22000	
 22001	The old prince came in to supper; this was evidently on Pierreâs
 22002	account. And during the two days of the young manâs visit he was
 22003	extremely kind to him and told him to visit them again.
 22004	
 22005	When Pierre had gone and the members of the household met together, they
 22006	began to express their opinions of him as people always do after a new
 22007	acquaintance has left, but as seldom happens, no one said anything but
 22008	what was good of him.
 22009	
 22010	
 22011	
 22012	
 22013	
 22014	CHAPTER XV
 22015	
 22016	When returning from his leave, RostÃ³v felt, for the first time, how
 22017	close was the bond that united him to DenÃ­sov and the whole regiment.
 22018	
 22019	On approaching it, RostÃ³v felt as he had done when approaching his home
 22020	in Moscow. When he saw the first hussar with the unbuttoned uniform
 22021	of his regiment, when he recognized red-haired DemÃ©ntyev and saw the
 22022	picket ropes of the roan horses, when LavrÃºshka gleefully shouted to
 22023	his master, âThe count has come!â and DenÃ­sov, who had been asleep
 22024	on his bed, ran all disheveled out of the mud hut to embrace him,
 22025	and the officers collected round to greet the new arrival, RostÃ³v
 22026	experienced the same feeling as when his mother, his father, and his
 22027	sister had embraced him, and tears of joy choked him so that he could
 22028	not speak. The regiment was also a home, and as unalterably dear and
 22029	precious as his parentsâ house.
 22030	
 22031	When he had reported himself to the commander of the regiment and had
 22032	been reassigned to his former squadron, had been on duty and had gone
 22033	out foraging, when he had again entered into all the little interests
 22034	of the regiment and felt himself deprived of liberty and bound in one
 22035	narrow, unchanging frame, he experienced the same sense of peace, of
 22036	moral support, and the same sense of being at home here in his own
 22037	place, as he had felt under the parental roof. But here was none of
 22038	all that turmoil of the world at large, where he did not know his right
 22039	place and took mistaken decisions; here was no SÃ³nya with whom he
 22040	ought, or ought not, to have an explanation; here was no possibility of
 22041	going there or not going there; here there were not twenty-four hours
 22042	in the day which could be spent in such a variety of ways; there was not
 22043	that innumerable crowd of people of whom not one was nearer to him or
 22044	farther from him than another; there were none of those uncertain and
 22045	undefined money relations with his father, and nothing to recall that
 22046	terrible loss to DÃ³lokhov. Here, in the regiment, all was clear and
 22047	simple. The whole world was divided into two unequal parts: one, our
 22048	PÃ¡vlograd regiment; the other, all the rest. And the rest was no
 22049	concern of his. In the regiment, everything was definite: who was
 22050	lieutenant, who captain, who was a good fellow, who a bad one, and most
 22051	of all, who was a comrade. The canteenkeeper gave one credit, oneâs
 22052	pay came every four months, there was nothing to think out or decide,
 22053	you had only to do nothing that was considered bad in the PÃ¡vlograd
 22054	regiment and, when given an order, to do what was clearly, distinctly,
 22055	and definitely orderedâand all would be well.
 22056	
 22057	Having once more entered into the definite conditions of this regimental
 22058	life, RostÃ³v felt the joy and relief a tired man feels on lying down to
 22059	rest. Life in the regiment, during this campaign, was all the pleasanter
 22060	for him, because, after his loss to DÃ³lokhov (for which, in spite
 22061	of all his familyâs efforts to console him, he could not forgive
 22062	himself), he had made up his mind to atone for his fault by serving,
 22063	not as he had done before, but really well, and by being a perfectly
 22064	first-rate comrade and officerâin a word, a splendid man altogether, a
 22065	thing which seemed so difficult out in the world, but so possible in the
 22066	regiment.
 22067	
 22068	After his losses, he had determined to pay back his debt to his parents
 22069	in five years. He received ten thousand rubles a year, but now resolved
 22070	to take only two thousand and leave the rest to repay the debt to his
 22071	parents.
 22072	
 22073	Our army, after repeated retreats and advances and battles at PultÃºsk
 22074	and Preussisch-Eylau, was concentrated near Bartenstein. It was awaiting
 22075	the Emperorâs arrival and the beginning of a new campaign.
 22076	
 22077	The PÃ¡vlograd regiment, belonging to that part of the army which had
 22078	served in the 1805 campaign, had been recruiting up to strength in
 22079	Russia, and arrived too late to take part in the first actions of the
 22080	campaign. It had been neither at PultÃºsk nor at Preussisch-Eylau and,
 22081	when it joined the army in the field in the second half of the campaign,
 22082	was attached to PlÃ¡tovâs division.
 22083	
 22084	PlÃ¡tovâs division was acting independently of the main army. Several
 22085	times parts of the PÃ¡vlograd regiment had exchanged shots with
 22086	the enemy, had taken prisoners, and once had even captured Marshal
 22087	Oudinotâs carriages. In April the PÃ¡vlograds were stationed immovably
 22088	for some weeks near a totally ruined and deserted German village.
 22089	
 22090	A thaw had set in, it was muddy and cold, the ice on the river broke,
 22091	and the roads became impassable. For days neither provisions for the
 22092	men nor fodder for the horses had been issued. As no transports could
 22093	arrive, the men dispersed about the abandoned and deserted villages,
 22094	searching for potatoes, but found few even of these.
 22095	
 22096	Everything had been eaten up and the inhabitants had all fledâif any
 22097	remained, they were worse than beggars and nothing more could be taken
 22098	from them; even the soldiers, usually pitiless enough, instead of taking
 22099	anything from them, often gave them the last of their rations.
 22100	
 22101	The PÃ¡vlograd regiment had had only two men wounded in action, but had
 22102	lost nearly half its men from hunger and sickness. In the hospitals,
 22103	death was so certain that soldiers suffering from fever, or the swelling
 22104	that came from bad food, preferred to remain on duty, and hardly able
 22105	to drag their legs went to the front rather than to the hospitals.
 22106	When spring came on, the soldiers found a plant just showing out of the
 22107	ground that looked like asparagus, which, for some reason, they called
 22108	âMÃ¡shkaâs sweet root.â It was very bitter, but they wandered
 22109	about the fields seeking it and dug it out with their sabers and ate it,
 22110	though they were ordered not to do so, as it was a noxious plant. That
 22111	spring a new disease broke out among the soldiers, a swelling of the
 22112	arms, legs, and face, which the doctors attributed to eating this root.
 22113	But in spite of all this, the soldiers of DenÃ­sovâs squadron fed
 22114	chiefly on âMÃ¡shkaâs sweet root,â because it was the second week
 22115	that the last of the biscuits were being doled out at the rate of half a
 22116	pound a man and the last potatoes received had sprouted and frozen.
 22117	
 22118	The horses also had been fed for a fortnight on straw from the thatched
 22119	roofs and had become terribly thin, though still covered with tufts of
 22120	felty winter hair.
 22121	
 22122	Despite this destitution, the soldiers and officers went on living just
 22123	as usual. Despite their pale swollen faces and tattered uniforms, the
 22124	hussars formed line for roll call, kept things in order, groomed their
 22125	horses, polished their arms, brought in straw from the thatched roofs in
 22126	place of fodder, and sat down to dine round the caldrons from which
 22127	they rose up hungry, joking about their nasty food and their hunger. As
 22128	usual, in their spare time, they lit bonfires, steamed themselves before
 22129	them naked; smoked, picked out and baked sprouting rotten potatoes, told
 22130	and listened to stories of PotÃ«mkinâs and SuvÃ³rovâs campaigns, or
 22131	to legends of AlÃ«sha the Sly, or the priestâs laborer MikÃ³lka.
 22132	
 22133	The officers, as usual, lived in twos and threes in the roofless,
 22134	half-ruined houses. The seniors tried to collect straw and potatoes and,
 22135	in general, food for the men. The younger ones occupied themselves as
 22136	before, some playing cards (there was plenty of money, though there was
 22137	no food), some with more innocent games, such as quoits and skittles.
 22138	The general trend of the campaign was rarely spoken of, partly because
 22139	nothing certain was known about it, partly because there was a vague
 22140	feeling that in the main it was going badly.
 22141	
 22142	RostÃ³v lived, as before, with DenÃ­sov, and since their furlough they
 22143	had become more friendly than ever. DenÃ­sov never spoke of RostÃ³vâs
 22144	family, but by the tender friendship his commander showed him, RostÃ³v
 22145	felt that the elder hussarâs luckless love for NatÃ¡sha played a part
 22146	in strengthening their friendship. DenÃ­sov evidently tried to expose
 22147	RostÃ³v to danger as seldom as possible, and after an action greeted his
 22148	safe return with evident joy. On one of his foraging expeditions, in
 22149	a deserted and ruined village to which he had come in search of
 22150	provisions, RostÃ³v found a family consisting of an old Pole and his
 22151	daughter with an infant in arms. They were half clad, hungry, too weak
 22152	to get away on foot and had no means of obtaining a conveyance. RostÃ³v
 22153	brought them to his quarters, placed them in his own lodging, and
 22154	kept them for some weeks while the old man was recovering. One of his
 22155	comrades, talking of women, began chaffing RostÃ³v, saying that he was
 22156	more wily than any of them and that it would not be a bad thing if he
 22157	introduced to them the pretty Polish girl he had saved. RostÃ³v took
 22158	the joke as an insult, flared up, and said such unpleasant things to the
 22159	officer that it was all DenÃ­sov could do to prevent a duel. When
 22160	the officer had gone away, DenÃ­sov, who did not himself know what
 22161	RostÃ³vâs relations with the Polish girl might be, began to upbraid
 22162	him for his quickness of temper, and RostÃ³v replied:
 22163	
 22164	âSay what you like.... She is like a sister to me, and I canât tell
 22165	you how it offended me... because... well, for that reason....â
 22166	
 22167	DenÃ­sov patted him on the shoulder and began rapidly pacing the room
 22168	without looking at RostÃ³v, as was his way at moments of deep feeling.
 22169	
 22170	âAh, what a mad bweed you WostÃ³vs are!â he muttered, and RostÃ³v
 22171	noticed tears in his eyes.
 22172	
 22173	
 22174	
 22175	
 22176	
 22177	CHAPTER XVI
 22178	
 22179	In April the troops were enlivened by news of the Emperorâs arrival,
 22180	but RostÃ³v had no chance of being present at the review he held at
 22181	Bartenstein, as the PÃ¡vlograds were at the outposts far beyond that
 22182	place.
 22183	
 22184	They were bivouacking. DenÃ­sov and RostÃ³v were living in an earth hut,
 22185	dug out for them by the soldiers and roofed with branches and turf. The
 22186	hut was made in the following manner, which had then come into vogue. A
 22187	trench was dug three and a half feet wide, four feet eight inches deep,
 22188	and eight feet long. At one end of the trench, steps were cut out and
 22189	these formed the entrance and vestibule. The trench itself was the room,
 22190	in which the lucky ones, such as the squadron commander, had a board,
 22191	lying on piles at the end opposite the entrance, to serve as a table. On
 22192	each side of the trench, the earth was cut out to a breadth of about two
 22193	and a half feet, and this did duty for bedsteads and couches. The roof
 22194	was so constructed that one could stand up in the middle of the trench
 22195	and could even sit up on the beds if one drew close to the table.
 22196	DenÃ­sov, who was living luxuriously because the soldiers of his
 22197	squadron liked him, had also a board in the roof at the farther end,
 22198	with a piece of (broken but mended) glass in it for a window. When it
 22199	was very cold, embers from the soldiersâ campfire were placed on
 22200	a bent sheet of iron on the steps in the âreception roomââas
 22201	DenÃ­sov called that part of the hutâand it was then so warm that the
 22202	officers, of whom there were always some with DenÃ­sov and RostÃ³v, sat
 22203	in their shirt sleeves.
 22204	
 22205	In April, RostÃ³v was on orderly duty. One morning, between seven and
 22206	eight, returning after a sleepless night, he sent for embers, changed
 22207	his rain-soaked underclothes, said his prayers, drank tea, got warm,
 22208	then tidied up the things on the table and in his own corner, and,
 22209	his face glowing from exposure to the wind and with nothing on but his
 22210	shirt, lay down on his back, putting his arms under his head. He was
 22211	pleasantly considering the probability of being promoted in a few days
 22212	for his last reconnoitering expedition, and was awaiting DenÃ­sov, who
 22213	had gone out somewhere and with whom he wanted a talk.
 22214	
 22215	Suddenly he heard DenÃ­sov shouting in a vibrating voice behind the hut,
 22216	evidently much excited. RostÃ³v moved to the window to see whom he was
 22217	speaking to, and saw the quartermaster, TopchÃ©enko.
 22218	
 22219	âI ordered you not to let them eat that MÃ¡shka woot stuff!â
 22220	DenÃ­sov was shouting. âAnd I saw with my own eyes how LazarchÃºk
 22221	bwought some fwom the fields.â
 22222	
 22223	âI have given the order again and again, your honor, but they donât
 22224	obey,â answered the quartermaster.
 22225	
 22226	RostÃ³v lay down again on his bed and thought complacently: âLet
 22227	him fuss and bustle now, my jobâs done and Iâm lying
 22228	downâcapitally!â He could hear that LavrÃºshkaâthat sly, bold
 22229	orderly of DenÃ­sovâsâwas talking, as well as the quartermaster.
 22230	LavrÃºshka was saying something about loaded wagons, biscuits, and oxen
 22231	he had seen when he had gone out for provisions.
 22232	
 22233	Then DenÃ­sovâs voice was heard shouting farther and farther away.
 22234	âSaddle! Second platoon!â
 22235	
 22236	âWhere are they off to now?â thought RostÃ³v.
 22237	
 22238	Five minutes later, DenÃ­sov came into the hut, climbed with muddy boots
 22239	on the bed, lit his pipe, furiously scattered his things about, took
 22240	his leaded whip, buckled on his saber, and went out again. In answer to
 22241	RostÃ³vâs inquiry where he was going, he answered vaguely and crossly
 22242	that he had some business.
 22243	
 22244	âLet God and our gweat monarch judge me afterwards!â said DenÃ­sov
 22245	going out, and RostÃ³v heard the hoofs of several horses splashing
 22246	through the mud. He did not even trouble to find out where DenÃ­sov had
 22247	gone. Having got warm in his corner, he fell asleep and did not leave
 22248	the hut till toward evening. DenÃ­sov had not yet returned. The weather
 22249	had cleared up, and near the next hut two officers and a cadet were
 22250	playing svÃ¡yka, laughing as they threw their missiles which buried
 22251	themselves in the soft mud. RostÃ³v joined them. In the middle of the
 22252	game, the officers saw some wagons approaching with fifteen hussars on
 22253	their skinny horses behind them. The wagons escorted by the hussars drew
 22254	up to the picket ropes and a crowd of hussars surrounded them.
 22255	
 22256	âThere now, DenÃ­sov has been worrying,â said RostÃ³v, âand here
 22257	are the provisions.â
 22258	
 22259	âSo they are!â said the officers. âWonât the soldiers be
 22260	glad!â
 22261	
 22262	A little behind the hussars came DenÃ­sov, accompanied by two infantry
 22263	officers with whom he was talking.
 22264	
 22265	RostÃ³v went to meet them.
 22266	
 22267	âI warn you, Captain,â one of the officers, a short thin man,
 22268	evidently very angry, was saying.
 22269	
 22270	âHavenât I told you I wonât give them up?â replied DenÃ­sov.
 22271	
 22272	âYou will answer for it, Captain. It is mutinyâseizing the transport
 22273	of oneâs own army. Our men have had nothing to eat for two days.â
 22274	
 22275	âAnd mine have had nothing for two weeks,â said DenÃ­sov.
 22276	
 22277	âIt is robbery! Youâll answer for it, sir!â said the infantry
 22278	officer, raising his voice.
 22279	
 22280	âNow, what are you pestewing me for?â cried DenÃ­sov, suddenly
 22281	losing his temper. âI shall answer for it and not you, and youâd
 22282	better not buzz about here till you get hurt. Be off! Go!â he shouted
 22283	at the officers.
 22284	
 22285	âVery well, then!â shouted the little officer, undaunted and not
 22286	riding away. âIf you are determined to rob, Iâll...â
 22287	
 22288	âGo to the devil! quick maâch, while youâre safe and sound!â and
 22289	DenÃ­sov turned his horse on the officer.
 22290	
 22291	âVery well, very well!â muttered the officer, threateningly, and
 22292	turning his horse he trotted away, jolting in his saddle.
 22293	
 22294	âA dog astwide a fence! A weal dog astwide a fence!â shouted
 22295	DenÃ­sov after him (the most insulting expression a cavalryman can
 22296	address to a mounted infantryman) and riding up to RostÃ³v, he burst out
 22297	laughing.
 22298	
 22299	âIâve taken twansports from the infantwy by force!â he said.
 22300	âAfter all, canât let our men starve.â
 22301	
 22302	The wagons that had reached the hussars had been consigned to an
 22303	infantry regiment, but learning from LavrÃºshka that the transport
 22304	was unescorted, DenÃ­sov with his hussars had seized it by force. The
 22305	soldiers had biscuits dealt out to them freely, and they even shared
 22306	them with the other squadrons.
 22307	
 22308	The next day the regimental commander sent for DenÃ­sov, and holding his
 22309	fingers spread out before his eyes said:
 22310	
 22311	âThis is how I look at this affair: I know nothing about it and
 22312	wonât begin proceedings, but I advise you to ride over to the staff
 22313	and settle the business there in the commissariat department and if
 22314	possible sign a receipt for such and such stores received. If not, as
 22315	the demand was booked against an infantry regiment, there will be a row
 22316	and the affair may end badly.â
 22317	
 22318	From the regimental commanderâs, DenÃ­sov rode straight to the staff
 22319	with a sincere desire to act on this advice. In the evening he came
 22320	back to his dugout in a state such as RostÃ³v had never yet seen him in.
 22321	DenÃ­sov could not speak and gasped for breath. When RostÃ³v asked what
 22322	was the matter, he only uttered some incoherent oaths and threats in a
 22323	hoarse, feeble voice.
 22324	
 22325	Alarmed at DenÃ­sovâs condition, RostÃ³v suggested that he should
 22326	undress, drink some water, and send for the doctor.
 22327	
 22328	âTwy me for wobbewy... oh! Some more water... Let them twy me, but
 22329	Iâll always thwash scoundwels... and Iâll tell the Empewoâ...
 22330	Ice...â he muttered.
 22331	
 22332	The regimental doctor, when he came, said it was absolutely necessary
 22333	to bleed DenÃ­sov. A deep saucer of black blood was taken from his hairy
 22334	arm and only then was he able to relate what had happened to him.
 22335	
 22336	âI get there,â began DenÃ­sov. ââNow then, whereâs your
 22337	chiefâs quarters?â They were pointed out. âPlease to wait.â
 22338	âIâve widden twenty miles and have duties to attend to and no time
 22339	to wait. Announce me.â Vewy well, so out comes their head
 22340	chiefâalso took it into his head to lecture me: âItâs
 22341	wobbewy!âââWobbewy,â I say, âis not done by man who seizes
 22342	pwovisions to feed his soldiers, but by him who takes them to fill his
 22343	own pockets!â âWill you please be silent?â âVewy good!â Then
 22344	he says: âGo and give a weceipt to the commissioner, but your affair
 22345	will be passed on to headquarters.â I go to the commissioner. I enter,
 22346	and at the table... who do you think? No, but wait a bit!... Who is it
 22347	thatâs starving us?â shouted DenÃ­sov, hitting the table with the
 22348	fist of his newly bled arm so violently that the table nearly broke down
 22349	and the tumblers on it jumped about. âTelyÃ¡nin! âWhat? So itâs
 22350	you whoâs starving us to death! Is it? Take this and this!â and I
 22351	hit him so pat, stwaight on his snout... âAh, what a... what a...!â
 22352	and I staâted fwashing him... Well, Iâve had a bit of fun I can tell
 22353	you!â cried DenÃ­sov, gleeful and yet angry, his white teeth showing
 22354	under his black mustache. âIâd have killed him if they hadnât
 22355	taken him away!â
 22356	
 22357	âBut what are you shouting for? Calm yourself,â said RostÃ³v.
 22358	âYouâve set your arm bleeding afresh. Wait, we must tie it up
 22359	again.â
 22360	
 22361	DenÃ­sov was bandaged up again and put to bed. Next day he woke calm and
 22362	cheerful.
 22363	
 22364	But at noon the adjutant of the regiment came into RostÃ³vâs and
 22365	DenÃ­sovâs dugout with a grave and serious face and regretfully showed
 22366	them a paper addressed to Major DenÃ­sov from the regimental commander
 22367	in which inquiries were made about yesterdayâs occurrence. The
 22368	adjutant told them that the affair was likely to take a very bad
 22369	turn: that a court-martial had been appointed, and that in view of the
 22370	severity with which marauding and insubordination were now regarded,
 22371	degradation to the ranks would be the best that could be hoped for.
 22372	
 22373	The case, as represented by the offended parties, was that, after
 22374	seizing the transports, Major DenÃ­sov, being drunk, went to the chief
 22375	quartermaster and without any provocation called him a thief, threatened
 22376	to strike him, and on being led out had rushed into the office and given
 22377	two officials a thrashing, and dislocated the arm of one of them.
 22378	
 22379	In answer to RostÃ³vâs renewed questions, DenÃ­sov said, laughing,
 22380	that he thought he remembered that some other fellow had got mixed up
 22381	in it, but that it was all nonsense and rubbish, and he did not in the
 22382	least fear any kind of trial, and that if those scoundrels dared attack
 22383	him he would give them an answer that they would not easily forget.
 22384	
 22385	DenÃ­sov spoke contemptuously of the whole matter, but RostÃ³v knew him
 22386	too well not to detect that (while hiding it from others) at heart
 22387	he feared a court-martial and was worried over the affair, which was
 22388	evidently taking a bad turn. Every day, letters of inquiry and notices
 22389	from the court arrived, and on the first of May, DenÃ­sov was ordered
 22390	to hand the squadron over to the next in seniority and appear before
 22391	the staff of his division to explain his violence at the commissariat
 22392	office. On the previous day PlÃ¡tov reconnoitered with two Cossack
 22393	regiments and two squadrons of hussars. DenÃ­sov, as was his wont, rode
 22394	out in front of the outposts, parading his courage. A bullet fired by
 22395	a French sharpshooter hit him in the fleshy part of his leg. Perhaps at
 22396	another time DenÃ­sov would not have left the regiment for so slight a
 22397	wound, but now he took advantage of it to excuse himself from appearing
 22398	at the staff and went into hospital.
 22399	
 22400	
 22401	
 22402	
 22403	
 22404	CHAPTER XVII
 22405	
 22406	In June the battle of Friedland was fought, in which the PÃ¡vlograds did
 22407	not take part, and after that an armistice was proclaimed. RostÃ³v, who
 22408	felt his friendâs absence very much, having no news of him since he
 22409	left and feeling very anxious about his wound and the progress of his
 22410	affairs, took advantage of the armistice to get leave to visit DenÃ­sov
 22411	in hospital.
 22412	
 22413	The hospital was in a small Prussian town that had been twice devastated
 22414	by Russian and French troops. Because it was summer, when it is so
 22415	beautiful out in the fields, the little town presented a particularly
 22416	dismal appearance with its broken roofs and fences, its foul streets,
 22417	tattered inhabitants, and the sick and drunken soldiers wandering about.
 22418	
 22419	The hospital was in a brick building with some of the window frames and
 22420	panes broken and a courtyard surrounded by the remains of a wooden fence
 22421	that had been pulled to pieces. Several bandaged soldiers, with pale
 22422	swollen faces, were sitting or walking about in the sunshine in the
 22423	yard.
 22424	
 22425	Directly RostÃ³v entered the door he was enveloped by a smell of
 22426	putrefaction and hospital air. On the stairs he met a Russian army
 22427	doctor smoking a cigar. The doctor was followed by a Russian assistant.
 22428	
 22429	âI canât tear myself to pieces,â the doctor was saying. âCome to
 22430	MakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich in the evening. I shall be there.â
 22431	
 22432	The assistant asked some further questions.
 22433	
 22434	âOh, do the best you can! Isnât it all the same?â The doctor
 22435	noticed RostÃ³v coming upstairs.
 22436	
 22437	âWhat do you want, sir?â said the doctor. âWhat do you want?
 22438	The bullets having spared you, do you want to try typhus? This is a
 22439	pesthouse, sir.â
 22440	
 22441	âHow so?â asked RostÃ³v.
 22442	
 22443	âTyphus, sir. Itâs death to go in. Only we two, MakÃ©ev and Iâ (he
 22444	pointed to the assistant), âkeep on here. Some five of us doctors have
 22445	died in this place.... When a new one comes he is done for in a week,â
 22446	said the doctor with evident satisfaction. âPrussian doctors have been
 22447	invited here, but our allies donât like it at all.â
 22448	
 22449	RostÃ³v explained that he wanted to see Major DenÃ­sov of the hussars,
 22450	who was wounded.
 22451	
 22452	âI donât know. I canât tell you, sir. Only think! I am alone in
 22453	charge of three hospitals with more than four hundred patients! Itâs
 22454	well that the charitable Prussian ladies send us two pounds of coffee
 22455	and some lint each month or we should be lost!â he laughed. âFour
 22456	hundred, sir, and theyâre always sending me fresh ones. There are four
 22457	hundred? Eh?â he asked, turning to the assistant.
 22458	
 22459	The assistant looked fagged out. He was evidently vexed and impatient
 22460	for the talkative doctor to go.
 22461	
 22462	âMajor DenÃ­sov,â RostÃ³v said again. âHe was wounded at
 22463	Molliten.â
 22464	
 22465	âDead, I fancy. Eh, MakÃ©ev?â queried the doctor, in a tone of
 22466	indifference.
 22467	
 22468	The assistant, however, did not confirm the doctorâs words.
 22469	
 22470	âIs he tall and with reddish hair?â asked the doctor.
 22471	
 22472	RostÃ³v described DenÃ­sovâs appearance.
 22473	
 22474	âThere was one like that,â said the doctor, as if pleased. âThat
 22475	one is dead, I fancy. However, Iâll look up our list. We had a list.
 22476	Have you got it, MakÃ©ev?â
 22477	
 22478	âMakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich has the list,â answered the assistant. âBut if
 22479	youâll step into the officersâ wards youâll see for yourself,â
 22480	he added, turning to RostÃ³v.
 22481	
 22482	âAh, youâd better not go, sir,â said the doctor, âor you may
 22483	have to stay here yourself.â
 22484	
 22485	But RostÃ³v bowed himself away from the doctor and asked the assistant
 22486	to show him the way.
 22487	
 22488	âOnly donât blame me!â the doctor shouted up after him.
 22489	
 22490	RostÃ³v and the assistant went into the dark corridor. The smell was so
 22491	strong there that RostÃ³v held his nose and had to pause and collect
 22492	his strength before he could go on. A door opened to the right, and an
 22493	emaciated sallow man on crutches, barefoot and in underclothing, limped
 22494	out and, leaning against the doorpost, looked with glittering envious
 22495	eyes at those who were passing. Glancing in at the door, RostÃ³v
 22496	saw that the sick and wounded were lying on the floor on straw and
 22497	overcoats.
 22498	
 22499	âMay I go in and look?â
 22500	
 22501	âWhat is there to see?â said the assistant.
 22502	
 22503	But, just because the assistant evidently did not want him to go in,
 22504	RostÃ³v entered the soldiersâ ward. The foul air, to which he had
 22505	already begun to get used in the corridor, was still stronger here. It
 22506	was a little different, more pungent, and one felt that this was where
 22507	it originated.
 22508	
 22509	In the long room, brightly lit up by the sun through the large windows,
 22510	the sick and wounded lay in two rows with their heads to the walls, and
 22511	leaving a passage in the middle. Most of them were unconscious and
 22512	paid no attention to the newcomers. Those who were conscious raised
 22513	themselves or lifted their thin yellow faces, and all looked intently at
 22514	RostÃ³v with the same expression of hope, of relief, reproach, and
 22515	envy of anotherâs health. RostÃ³v went to the middle of the room and
 22516	looking through the open doors into the two adjoining rooms saw the same
 22517	thing there. He stood still, looking silently around. He had not at all
 22518	expected such a sight. Just before him, almost across the middle of the
 22519	passage on the bare floor, lay a sick man, probably a Cossack to judge
 22520	by the cut of his hair. The man lay on his back, his huge arms and legs
 22521	outstretched. His face was purple, his eyes were rolled back so that
 22522	only the whites were seen, and on his bare legs and arms which were
 22523	still red, the veins stood out like cords. He was knocking the back of
 22524	his head against the floor, hoarsely uttering some word which he kept
 22525	repeating. RostÃ³v listened and made out the word. It was âdrink,
 22526	drink, a drink!â RostÃ³v glanced round, looking for someone who would
 22527	put this man back in his place and bring him water.
 22528	
 22529	âWho looks after the sick here?â he asked the assistant.
 22530	
 22531	Just then a commissariat soldier, a hospital orderly, came in from the
 22532	next room, marching stiffly, and drew up in front of RostÃ³v.
 22533	
 22534	âGood day, your honor!â he shouted, rolling his eyes at RostÃ³v and
 22535	evidently mistaking him for one of the hospital authorities.
 22536	
 22537	âGet him to his place and give him some water,â said RostÃ³v,
 22538	pointing to the Cossack.
 22539	
 22540	âYes, your honor,â the soldier replied complacently, and rolling
 22541	his eyes more than ever he drew himself up still straighter, but did not
 22542	move.
 22543	
 22544	âNo, itâs impossible to do anything here,â thought RostÃ³v,
 22545	lowering his eyes, and he was going out, but became aware of an intense
 22546	look fixed on him on his right, and he turned. Close to the corner, on
 22547	an overcoat, sat an old, unshaven, gray-bearded soldier as thin as a
 22548	skeleton, with a stern sallow face and eyes intently fixed on RostÃ³v.
 22549	The manâs neighbor on one side whispered something to him, pointing
 22550	at RostÃ³v, who noticed that the old man wanted to speak to him. He drew
 22551	nearer and saw that the old man had only one leg bent under him, the
 22552	other had been amputated above the knee. His neighbor on the other side,
 22553	who lay motionless some distance from him with his head thrown back, was
 22554	a young soldier with a snub nose. His pale waxen face was still freckled
 22555	and his eyes were rolled back. RostÃ³v looked at the young soldier and a
 22556	cold chill ran down his back.
 22557	
 22558	âWhy, this one seems...â he began, turning to the assistant.
 22559	
 22560	âAnd how weâve been begging, your honor,â said the old soldier,
 22561	his jaw quivering. âHeâs been dead since morning. After all weâre
 22562	men, not dogs.â
 22563	
 22564	âIâll send someone at once. He shall be taken awayâtaken away at
 22565	once,â said the assistant hurriedly. âLet us go, your honor.â
 22566	
 22567	âYes, yes, let us go,â said RostÃ³v hastily, and lowering his
 22568	eyes and shrinking, he tried to pass unnoticed between the rows of
 22569	reproachful envious eyes that were fixed upon him, and went out of the
 22570	room.
 22571	
 22572	
 22573	
 22574	
 22575	
 22576	CHAPTER XVIII
 22577	
 22578	Going along the corridor, the assistant led RostÃ³v to the officersâ
 22579	wards, consisting of three rooms, the doors of which stood open. There
 22580	were beds in these rooms and the sick and wounded officers were lying or
 22581	sitting on them. Some were walking about the rooms in hospital dressing
 22582	gowns. The first person RostÃ³v met in the officersâ ward was a thin
 22583	little man with one arm, who was walking about the first room in a
 22584	nightcap and hospital dressing gown, with a pipe between his teeth.
 22585	RostÃ³v looked at him, trying to remember where he had seen him before.
 22586	
 22587	âSee where weâve met again!â said the little man. âTÃºshin,
 22588	TÃºshin, donât you remember, who gave you a lift at SchÃ¶n Grabern?
 22589	And Iâve had a bit cut off, you see...â he went on with a smile,
 22590	pointing to the empty sleeve of his dressing gown. âLooking for
 22591	VasÃ­li DmÃ­trich DenÃ­sov? My neighbor,â he added, when he heard
 22592	who RostÃ³v wanted. âHere, here,â and TÃºshin led him into the next
 22593	room, from whence came sounds of several laughing voices.
 22594	
 22595	âHow can they laugh, or even live at all here?â thought RostÃ³v,
 22596	still aware of that smell of decomposing flesh that had been so strong
 22597	in the soldiersâ ward, and still seeming to see fixed on him those
 22598	envious looks which had followed him out from both sides, and the face
 22599	of that young soldier with eyes rolled back.
 22600	
 22601	DenÃ­sov lay asleep on his bed with his head under the blanket, though
 22602	it was nearly noon.
 22603	
 22604	âAh, WostÃ³v? How are you, how are you?â he called out, still in the
 22605	same voice as in the regiment, but RostÃ³v noticed sadly that under this
 22606	habitual ease and animation some new, sinister, hidden feeling showed
 22607	itself in the expression of DenÃ­sovâs face and the intonations of his
 22608	voice.
 22609	
 22610	His wound, though a slight one, had not yet healed even now, six weeks
 22611	after he had been hit. His face had the same swollen pallor as the faces
 22612	of the other hospital patients, but it was not this that struck RostÃ³v.
 22613	What struck him was that DenÃ­sov did not seem glad to see him, and
 22614	smiled at him unnaturally. He did not ask about the regiment, nor about
 22615	the general state of affairs, and when RostÃ³v spoke of these matters
 22616	did not listen.
 22617	
 22618	RostÃ³v even noticed that DenÃ­sov did not like to be reminded of the
 22619	regiment, or in general of that other free life which was going on
 22620	outside the hospital. He seemed to try to forget that old life and
 22621	was only interested in the affair with the commissariat officers. On
 22622	RostÃ³vâs inquiry as to how the matter stood, he at once produced from
 22623	under his pillow a paper he had received from the commission and the
 22624	rough draft of his answer to it. He became animated when he began
 22625	reading his paper and specially drew RostÃ³vâs attention to the
 22626	stinging rejoinders he made to his enemies. His hospital companions,
 22627	who had gathered round RostÃ³vâa fresh arrival from the world
 22628	outsideâgradually began to disperse as soon as DenÃ­sov began reading
 22629	his answer. RostÃ³v noticed by their faces that all those gentlemen had
 22630	already heard that story more than once and were tired of it. Only the
 22631	man who had the next bed, a stout Uhlan, continued to sit on his bed,
 22632	gloomily frowning and smoking a pipe, and little one-armed TÃºshin still
 22633	listened, shaking his head disapprovingly. In the middle of the reading,
 22634	the Uhlan interrupted DenÃ­sov.
 22635	
 22636	âBut what I say is,â he said, turning to RostÃ³v, âit would be
 22637	best simply to petition the Emperor for pardon. They say great rewards
 22638	will now be distributed, and surely a pardon would be granted....â
 22639	
 22640	âMe petition the Empewoâ!â exclaimed DenÃ­sov, in a voice to which
 22641	he tried hard to give the old energy and fire, but which sounded like
 22642	an expression of irritable impotence. âWhat for? If I were a wobber I
 22643	would ask mercy, but Iâm being court-martialed for bwinging wobbers
 22644	to book. Let them twy me, Iâm not afwaid of anyone. Iâve served
 22645	the Tsar and my countwy honowably and have not stolen! And am I to be
 22646	degwaded?... Listen, Iâm wâiting to them stwaight. This is what I
 22647	say: âIf I had wobbed the Tweasuwy...ââ
 22648	
 22649	âItâs certainly well written,â said TÃºshin, âbut thatâs not
 22650	the point, VasÃ­li DmÃ­trich,â and he also turned to RostÃ³v. âOne
 22651	has to submit, and VasÃ­li DmÃ­trich doesnât want to. You know the
 22652	auditor told you it was a bad business.â
 22653	
 22654	âWell, let it be bad,â said DenÃ­sov.
 22655	
 22656	âThe auditor wrote out a petition for you,â continued TÃºshin,
 22657	âand you ought to sign it and ask this gentleman to take it. No doubt
 22658	heâ (indicating RostÃ³v) âhas connections on the staff. You wonât
 22659	find a better opportunity.â
 22660	
 22661	âHavenât I said Iâm not going to gwovel?â DenÃ­sov interrupted
 22662	him, went on reading his paper.
 22663	
 22664	RostÃ³v had not the courage to persuade DenÃ­sov, though he
 22665	instinctively felt that the way advised by TÃºshin and the other
 22666	officers was the safest, and though he would have been glad to be of
 22667	service to DenÃ­sov. He knew his stubborn will and straightforward hasty
 22668	temper.
 22669	
 22670	When the reading of DenÃ­sovâs virulent reply, which took more than an
 22671	hour, was over, RostÃ³v said nothing, and he spent the rest of the day
 22672	in a most dejected state of mind amid DenÃ­sovâs hospital comrades,
 22673	who had gathered round him, telling them what he knew and listening to
 22674	their stories. DenÃ­sov was moodily silent all the evening.
 22675	
 22676	Late in the evening, when RostÃ³v was about to leave, he asked DenÃ­sov
 22677	whether he had no commission for him.
 22678	
 22679	âYes, wait a bit,â said DenÃ­sov, glancing round at the officers,
 22680	and taking his papers from under his pillow he went to the window, where
 22681	he had an inkpot, and sat down to write.
 22682	
 22683	âIt seems itâs no use knocking oneâs head against a wall!â he
 22684	said, coming from the window and giving RostÃ³v a large envelope. In
 22685	it was the petition to the Emperor drawn up by the auditor, in
 22686	which DenÃ­sov, without alluding to the offenses of the commissariat
 22687	officials, simply asked for pardon.
 22688	
 22689	âHand it in. It seems...â
 22690	
 22691	He did not finish, but gave a painfully unnatural smile.
 22692	
 22693	
 22694	
 22695	
 22696	
 22697	CHAPTER XIX
 22698	
 22699	Having returned to the regiment and told the commander the state of
 22700	DenÃ­sovâs affairs, RostÃ³v rode to Tilsit with the letter to the
 22701	Emperor.
 22702	
 22703	On the thirteenth of June the French and Russian Emperors arrived in
 22704	Tilsit. BorÃ­s DrubetskÃ³y had asked the important personage on whom he
 22705	was in attendance, to include him in the suite appointed for the stay at
 22706	Tilsit.
 22707	
 22708	âI should like to see the great man,â he said, alluding to Napoleon,
 22709	whom hitherto he, like everyone else, had always called Buonaparte.
 22710	
 22711	âYou are speaking of Buonaparte?â asked the general, smiling.
 22712	
 22713	BorÃ­s looked at his general inquiringly and immediately saw that he was
 22714	being tested.
 22715	
 22716	âI am speaking, Prince, of the Emperor Napoleon,â he replied. The
 22717	general patted him on the shoulder, with a smile.
 22718	
 22719	âYou will go far,â he said, and took him to Tilsit with him.
 22720	
 22721	BorÃ­s was among the few present at the Niemen on the day the two
 22722	Emperors met. He saw the raft, decorated with monograms, saw Napoleon
 22723	pass before the French Guards on the farther bank of the river, saw the
 22724	pensive face of the Emperor Alexander as he sat in silence in a tavern
 22725	on the bank of the Niemen awaiting Napoleonâs arrival, saw both
 22726	Emperors get into boats, and saw how Napoleonâreaching the raft
 22727	firstâstepped quickly forward to meet Alexander and held out his hand
 22728	to him, and how they both retired into the pavilion. Since he had begun
 22729	to move in the highest circles BorÃ­s had made it his habit to watch
 22730	attentively all that went on around him and to note it down. At the time
 22731	of the meeting at Tilsit he asked the names of those who had come with
 22732	Napoleon and about the uniforms they wore, and listened attentively to
 22733	words spoken by important personages. At the moment the Emperors went
 22734	into the pavilion he looked at his watch, and did not forget to look at
 22735	it again when Alexander came out. The interview had lasted an hour and
 22736	fifty-three minutes. He noted this down that same evening, among other
 22737	facts he felt to be of historic importance. As the Emperorâs suite
 22738	was a very small one, it was a matter of great importance, for a man who
 22739	valued his success in the service, to be at Tilsit on the occasion of
 22740	this interview between the two Emperors, and having succeeded in this,
 22741	BorÃ­s felt that henceforth his position was fully assured. He had not
 22742	only become known, but people had grown accustomed to him and accepted
 22743	him. Twice he had executed commissions to the Emperor himself, so
 22744	that the latter knew his face, and all those at court, far from
 22745	cold-shouldering him as at first when they considered him a newcomer,
 22746	would now have been surprised had he been absent.
 22747	
 22748	BorÃ­s lodged with another adjutant, the Polish Count ZhilÃ­nski.
 22749	ZhilÃ­nski, a Pole brought up in Paris, was rich, and passionately
 22750	fond of the French, and almost every day of the stay at Tilsit, French
 22751	officers of the Guard and from French headquarters were dining and
 22752	lunching with him and BorÃ­s.
 22753	
 22754	On the evening of the twenty-fourth of June, Count ZhilÃ­nski arranged a
 22755	supper for his French friends. The guest of honor was an aide-de-camp of
 22756	Napoleonâs, there were also several French officers of the Guard,
 22757	and a page of Napoleonâs, a young lad of an old aristocratic French
 22758	family. That same day, RostÃ³v, profiting by the darkness to avoid being
 22759	recognized in civilian dress, came to Tilsit and went to the lodging
 22760	occupied by BorÃ­s and ZhilÃ­nski.
 22761	
 22762	RostÃ³v, in common with the whole army from which he came, was far
 22763	from having experienced the change of feeling toward Napoleon and the
 22764	Frenchâwho from being foes had suddenly become friendsâthat had
 22765	taken place at headquarters and in BorÃ­s. In the army, Bonaparte and
 22766	the French were still regarded with mingled feelings of anger, contempt,
 22767	and fear. Only recently, talking with one of PlÃ¡tovâs Cossack
 22768	officers, RostÃ³v had argued that if Napoleon were taken prisoner he
 22769	would be treated not as a sovereign, but as a criminal. Quite lately,
 22770	happening to meet a wounded French colonel on the road, RostÃ³v had
 22771	maintained with heat that peace was impossible between a legitimate
 22772	sovereign and the criminal Bonaparte. RostÃ³v was therefore unpleasantly
 22773	struck by the presence of French officers in BorÃ­sâ lodging, dressed
 22774	in uniforms he had been accustomed to see from quite a different point
 22775	of view from the outposts of the flank. As soon as he noticed a French
 22776	officer, who thrust his head out of the door, that warlike feeling of
 22777	hostility which he always experienced at the sight of the enemy suddenly
 22778	seized him. He stopped at the threshold and asked in Russian whether
 22779	DrubetskÃ³y lived there. BorÃ­s, hearing a strange voice in the
 22780	anteroom, came out to meet him. An expression of annoyance showed itself
 22781	for a moment on his face on first recognizing RostÃ³v.
 22782	
 22783	âAh, itâs you? Very glad, very glad to see you,â he said, however,
 22784	coming toward him with a smile. But RostÃ³v had noticed his first
 22785	impulse.
 22786	
 22787	âIâve come at a bad time I think. I should not have come, but I have
 22788	business,â he said coldly.
 22789	
 22790	âNo, I only wonder how you managed to get away from your regiment.
 22791	Dans un moment je suis Ã  vous,â * he said, answering someone who
 22792	called him.
 22793	
 22794	    * âIn a minute I shall be at your disposal.â
 22795	
 22796	
 22797	âI see Iâm intruding,â RostÃ³v repeated.
 22798	
 22799	The look of annoyance had already disappeared from BorÃ­sâ face:
 22800	having evidently reflected and decided how to act, he very quietly took
 22801	both RostÃ³vâs hands and led him into the next room. His eyes, looking
 22802	serenely and steadily at RostÃ³v, seemed to be veiled by something,
 22803	as if screened by blue spectacles of conventionality. So it seemed to
 22804	RostÃ³v.
 22805	
 22806	âOh, come now! As if you could come at a wrong time!â said BorÃ­s,
 22807	and he led him into the room where the supper table was laid and
 22808	introduced him to his guests, explaining that he was not a civilian, but
 22809	an hussar officer, and an old friend of his.
 22810	
 22811	âCount ZhilÃ­nskiâle Comte N. N.âle Capitaine S. S.,â said he,
 22812	naming his guests. RostÃ³v looked frowningly at the Frenchmen, bowed
 22813	reluctantly, and remained silent.
 22814	
 22815	ZhilÃ­nski evidently did not receive this new Russian person very
 22816	willingly into his circle and did not speak to RostÃ³v. BorÃ­s did not
 22817	appear to notice the constraint the newcomer produced and, with the same
 22818	pleasant composure and the same veiled look in his eyes with which
 22819	he had met RostÃ³v, tried to enliven the conversation. One of the
 22820	Frenchmen, with the politeness characteristic of his countrymen,
 22821	addressed the obstinately taciturn RostÃ³v, saying that the latter had
 22822	probably come to Tilsit to see the Emperor.
 22823	
 22824	âNo, I came on business,â replied RostÃ³v, briefly.
 22825	
 22826	RostÃ³v had been out of humor from the moment he noticed the look of
 22827	dissatisfaction on BorÃ­sâ face, and as always happens to those in a
 22828	bad humor, it seemed to him that everyone regarded him with aversion
 22829	and that he was in everybodyâs way. He really was in their way, for he
 22830	alone took no part in the conversation which again became general. The
 22831	looks the visitors cast on him seemed to say: âAnd what is he sitting
 22832	here for?â He rose and went up to BorÃ­s.
 22833	
 22834	âAnyhow, Iâm in your way,â he said in a low tone. âCome and talk
 22835	over my business and Iâll go away.â
 22836	
 22837	âOh, no, not at all,â said BorÃ­s. âBut if you are tired, come and
 22838	lie down in my room and have a rest.â
 22839	
 22840	âYes, really...â
 22841	
 22842	They went into the little room where BorÃ­s slept. RostÃ³v, without
 22843	sitting down, began at once, irritably (as if BorÃ­s were to blame in
 22844	some way) telling him about DenÃ­sovâs affair, asking him whether,
 22845	through his general, he could and would intercede with the Emperor on
 22846	DenÃ­sovâs behalf and get DenÃ­sovâs petition handed in. When he
 22847	and BorÃ­s were alone, RostÃ³v felt for the first time that he could not
 22848	look BorÃ­s in the face without a sense of awkwardness. BorÃ­s, with one
 22849	leg crossed over the other and stroking his left hand with the slender
 22850	fingers of his right, listened to RostÃ³v as a general listens to the
 22851	report of a subordinate, now looking aside and now gazing straight into
 22852	RostÃ³vâs eyes with the same veiled look. Each time this happened
 22853	RostÃ³v felt uncomfortable and cast down his eyes.
 22854	
 22855	âI have heard of such cases and know that His Majesty is very severe
 22856	in such affairs. I think it would be best not to bring it before the
 22857	Emperor, but to apply to the commander of the corps.... But in general,
 22858	I think...â
 22859	
 22860	âSo you donât want to do anything? Well then, say so!â RostÃ³v
 22861	almost shouted, not looking BorÃ­s in the face.
 22862	
 22863	BorÃ­s smiled.
 22864	
 22865	âOn the contrary, I will do what I can. Only I thought...â
 22866	
 22867	At that moment ZhilÃ­nskiâs voice was heard calling BorÃ­s.
 22868	
 22869	âWell then, go, go, go...â said RostÃ³v, and refusing supper and
 22870	remaining alone in the little room, he walked up and down for a long
 22871	time, hearing the lighthearted French conversation from the next room.
 22872	
 22873	
 22874	
 22875	
 22876	
 22877	CHAPTER XX
 22878	
 22879	RostÃ³v had come to Tilsit the day least suitable for a petition
 22880	on DenÃ­sovâs behalf. He could not himself go to the general in
 22881	attendance as he was in mufti and had come to Tilsit without permission
 22882	to do so, and BorÃ­s, even had he wished to, could not have done so on
 22883	the following day. On that day, June 27, the preliminaries of peace were
 22884	signed. The Emperors exchanged decorations: Alexander received the Cross
 22885	of the Legion of Honor and Napoleon the Order of St. Andrew of the
 22886	First Degree, and a dinner had been arranged for the evening, given by
 22887	a battalion of the French Guards to the PreobrazhÃ©nsk battalion. The
 22888	Emperors were to be present at that banquet.
 22889	
 22890	RostÃ³v felt so ill at ease and uncomfortable with BorÃ­s that, when the
 22891	latter looked in after supper, he pretended to be asleep, and early next
 22892	morning went away, avoiding BorÃ­s. In his civilian clothes and a
 22893	round hat, he wandered about the town, staring at the French and their
 22894	uniforms and at the streets and houses where the Russian and French
 22895	Emperors were staying. In a square he saw tables being set up and
 22896	preparations made for the dinner; he saw the Russian and French colors
 22897	draped from side to side of the streets, with huge monograms A and N. In
 22898	the windows of the houses also flags and bunting were displayed.
 22899	
 22900	âBorÃ­s doesnât want to help me and I donât want to ask him.
 22901	Thatâs settled,â thought Nicholas. âAll is over between us, but
 22902	I wonât leave here without having done all I can for DenÃ­sov and
 22903	certainly not without getting his letter to the Emperor. The Emperor!...
 22904	He is here!â thought RostÃ³v, who had unconsciously returned to the
 22905	house where Alexander lodged.
 22906	
 22907	Saddled horses were standing before the house and the suite were
 22908	assembling, evidently preparing for the Emperor to come out.
 22909	
 22910	âI may see him at any moment,â thought RostÃ³v. âIf only I were
 22911	to hand the letter direct to him and tell him all... could they really
 22912	arrest me for my civilian clothes? Surely not! He would understand on
 22913	whose side justice lies. He understands everything, knows everything.
 22914	Who can be more just, more magnanimous than he? And even if they did
 22915	arrest me for being here, what would it matter?â thought he, looking
 22916	at an officer who was entering the house the Emperor occupied. âAfter
 22917	all, people do go in.... Itâs all nonsense! Iâll go in and hand
 22918	the letter to the Emperor myself so much the worse for DrubetskÃ³y who
 22919	drives me to it!â And suddenly with a determination he himself did not
 22920	expect, RostÃ³v felt for the letter in his pocket and went straight to
 22921	the house.
 22922	
 22923	âNo, I wonât miss my opportunity now, as I did after Austerlitz,â
 22924	he thought, expecting every moment to meet the monarch, and conscious of
 22925	the blood that rushed to his heart at the thought. âI will fall at
 22926	his feet and beseech him. He will lift me up, will listen, and will even
 22927	thank me. âI am happy when I can do good, but to remedy injustice is
 22928	the greatest happiness,ââ RostÃ³v fancied the sovereign saying. And
 22929	passing people who looked after him with curiosity, he entered the porch
 22930	of the Emperorâs house.
 22931	
 22932	A broad staircase led straight up from the entry, and to the right he
 22933	saw a closed door. Below, under the staircase, was a door leading to the
 22934	lower floor.
 22935	
 22936	âWhom do you want?â someone inquired.
 22937	
 22938	âTo hand in a letter, a petition, to His Majesty,â said Nicholas,
 22939	with a tremor in his voice.
 22940	
 22941	âA petition? This way, to the officer on dutyâ (he was shown the
 22942	door leading downstairs), âonly it wonât be accepted.â
 22943	
 22944	On hearing this indifferent voice, RostÃ³v grew frightened at what
 22945	he was doing; the thought of meeting the Emperor at any moment was so
 22946	fascinating and consequently so alarming that he was ready to run away,
 22947	but the official who had questioned him opened the door, and RostÃ³v
 22948	entered.
 22949	
 22950	A short stout man of about thirty, in white breeches and high boots and
 22951	a batiste shirt that he had evidently only just put on, standing in that
 22952	room, and his valet was buttoning on to the back of his breeches a
 22953	new pair of handsome silk-embroidered braces that, for some reason,
 22954	attracted RostÃ³vâs attention. This man was speaking to someone in the
 22955	adjoining room.
 22956	
 22957	âA good figure and in her first bloom,â he was saying, but on seeing
 22958	RostÃ³v, he stopped short and frowned.
 22959	
 22960	âWhat is it? A petition?â
 22961	
 22962	âWhat is it?â asked the person in the other room.
 22963	
 22964	âAnother petitioner,â answered the man with the braces.
 22965	
 22966	âTell him to come later. Heâll be coming out directly, we must
 22967	go.â
 22968	
 22969	âLater... later! Tomorrow. Itâs too late...â
 22970	
 22971	RostÃ³v turned and was about to go, but the man in the braces stopped
 22972	him.
 22973	
 22974	âWhom have you come from? Who are you?â
 22975	
 22976	âI come from Major DenÃ­sov,â answered RostÃ³v.
 22977	
 22978	âAre you an officer?â
 22979	
 22980	âLieutenant Count RostÃ³v.â
 22981	
 22982	âWhat audacity! Hand it in through your commander. And go along with
 22983	you... go,â and he continued to put on the uniform the valet handed
 22984	him.
 22985	
 22986	RostÃ³v went back into the hall and noticed that in the porch there were
 22987	many officers and generals in full parade uniform, whom he had to pass.
 22988	
 22989	Cursing his temerity, his heart sinking at the thought of finding
 22990	himself at any moment face to face with the Emperor and being put to
 22991	shame and arrested in his presence, fully alive now to the impropriety
 22992	of his conduct and repenting of it, RostÃ³v, with downcast eyes, was
 22993	making his way out of the house through the brilliant suite when a
 22994	familiar voice called him and a hand detained him.
 22995	
 22996	âWhat are you doing here, sir, in civilian dress?â asked a deep
 22997	voice.
 22998	
 22999	It was a cavalry general who had obtained the Emperorâs special favor
 23000	during this campaign, and who had formerly commanded the division in
 23001	which RostÃ³v was serving.
 23002	
 23003	RostÃ³v, in dismay, began justifying himself, but seeing the kindly,
 23004	jocular face of the general, he took him aside and in an excited voice
 23005	told him the whole affair, asking him to intercede for DenÃ­sov, whom
 23006	the general knew. Having heard RostÃ³v to the end, the general shook his
 23007	head gravely.
 23008	
 23009	âIâm sorry, sorry for that fine fellow. Give me the letter.â
 23010	
 23011	Hardly had RostÃ³v handed him the letter and finished explaining
 23012	DenÃ­sovâs case, when hasty steps and the jingling of spurs were heard
 23013	on the stairs, and the general, leaving him, went to the porch. The
 23014	gentlemen of the Emperorâs suite ran down the stairs and went to their
 23015	horses. Hayne, the same groom who had been at Austerlitz, led up the
 23016	Emperorâs horse, and the faint creak of a footstep RostÃ³v knew at
 23017	once was heard on the stairs. Forgetting the danger of being recognized,
 23018	RostÃ³v went close to the porch, together with some inquisitive
 23019	civilians, and again, after two years, saw those features he adored:
 23020	that same face and same look and step, and the same union of majesty and
 23021	mildness.... And the feeling of enthusiasm and love for his sovereign
 23022	rose again in RostÃ³vâs soul in all its old force. In the uniform of
 23023	the PreobrazhÃ©nsk regimentâwhite chamois-leather breeches and high
 23024	bootsâand wearing a star RostÃ³v did not know (it was that of the
 23025	LÃ©gion dâhonneur), the monarch came out into the porch, putting on
 23026	his gloves and carrying his hat under his arm. He stopped and looked
 23027	about him, brightening everything around by his glance. He spoke a few
 23028	words to some of the generals, and, recognizing the former commander of
 23029	RostÃ³vâs division, smiled and beckoned to him.
 23030	
 23031	All the suite drew back and RostÃ³v saw the general talking for some
 23032	time to the Emperor.
 23033	
 23034	The Emperor said a few words to him and took a step toward his horse.
 23035	Again the crowd of members of the suite and street gazers (among whom
 23036	was RostÃ³v) moved nearer to the Emperor. Stopping beside his horse,
 23037	with his hand on the saddle, the Emperor turned to the cavalry general
 23038	and said in a loud voice, evidently wishing to be heard by all:
 23039	
 23040	âI cannot do it, General. I cannot, because the law is stronger than
 23041	I,â and he raised his foot to the stirrup.
 23042	
 23043	The general bowed his head respectfully, and the monarch mounted and
 23044	rode down the street at a gallop. Beside himself with enthusiasm,
 23045	RostÃ³v ran after him with the crowd.
 23046	
 23047	
 23048	
 23049	
 23050	
 23051	CHAPTER XXI
 23052	
 23053	The Emperor rode to the square where, facing one another, a battalion
 23054	of the PreobrazhÃ©nsk regiment stood on the right and a battalion of the
 23055	French Guards in their bearskin caps on the left.
 23056	
 23057	As the Tsar rode up to one flank of the battalions, which presented
 23058	arms, another group of horsemen galloped up to the opposite flank, and
 23059	at the head of them RostÃ³v recognized Napoleon. It could be no one
 23060	else. He came at a gallop, wearing a small hat, a blue uniform open over
 23061	a white vest, and the St. Andrew ribbon over his shoulder. He was riding
 23062	a very fine thoroughbred gray Arab horse with a crimson gold-embroidered
 23063	saddlecloth. On approaching Alexander he raised his hat, and as he did
 23064	so, RostÃ³v, with his cavalrymanâs eye, could not help noticing
 23065	that Napoleon did not sit well or firmly in the saddle. The battalions
 23066	shouted âHurrah!â and âVive lâEmpereur!â Napoleon said
 23067	something to Alexander, and both Emperors dismounted and took each
 23068	otherâs hands. Napoleonâs face wore an unpleasant and artificial
 23069	smile. Alexander was saying something affable to him.
 23070	
 23071	In spite of the trampling of the French gendarmesâ horses, which
 23072	were pushing back the crowd, RostÃ³v kept his eyes on every movement
 23073	of Alexander and Bonaparte. It struck him as a surprise that Alexander
 23074	treated Bonaparte as an equal and that the latter was quite at ease with
 23075	the Tsar, as if such relations with an Emperor were an everyday matter
 23076	to him.
 23077	
 23078	Alexander and Napoleon, with the long train of their suites, approached
 23079	the right flank of the PreobrazhÃ©nsk battalion and came straight up to
 23080	the crowd standing there. The crowd unexpectedly found itself so close
 23081	to the Emperors that RostÃ³v, standing in the front row, was afraid he
 23082	might be recognized.
 23083	
 23084	âSire, I ask your permission to present the Legion of Honor to the
 23085	bravest of your soldiers,â said a sharp, precise voice, articulating
 23086	every letter.
 23087	
 23088	This was said by the undersized Napoleon, looking up straight into
 23089	Alexanderâs eyes. Alexander listened attentively to what was said to
 23090	him and, bending his head, smiled pleasantly.
 23091	
 23092	âTo him who has borne himself most bravely in this last war,â added
 23093	Napoleon, accentuating each syllable, as with a composure and assurance
 23094	exasperating to RostÃ³v, he ran his eyes over the Russian ranks drawn
 23095	up before him, who all presented arms with their eyes fixed on their
 23096	Emperor.
 23097	
 23098	âWill Your Majesty allow me to consult the colonel?â said Alexander
 23099	and took a few hasty steps toward Prince KozlÃ³vski, the commander of
 23100	the battalion.
 23101	
 23102	Bonaparte meanwhile began taking the glove off his small white hand,
 23103	tore it in doing so, and threw it away. An aide-de-camp behind him
 23104	rushed forward and picked it up.
 23105	
 23106	âTo whom shall it be given?â the Emperor Alexander asked KozlÃ³vski,
 23107	in Russian in a low voice.
 23108	
 23109	âTo whomever Your Majesty commands.â
 23110	
 23111	The Emperor knit his brows with dissatisfaction and, glancing back,
 23112	remarked:
 23113	
 23114	âBut we must give him an answer.â
 23115	
 23116	KozlÃ³vski scanned the ranks resolutely and included RostÃ³v in his
 23117	scrutiny.
 23118	
 23119	âCan it be me?â thought RostÃ³v.
 23120	
 23121	âLÃ¡zarev!â the colonel called, with a frown, and LÃ¡zarev, the
 23122	first soldier in the rank, stepped briskly forward.
 23123	
 23124	âWhere are you off to? Stop here!â voices whispered to LÃ¡zarev who
 23125	did not know where to go. LÃ¡zarev stopped, casting a sidelong look at
 23126	his colonel in alarm. His face twitched, as often happens to soldiers
 23127	called before the ranks.
 23128	
 23129	Napoleon slightly turned his head, and put his plump little hand out
 23130	behind him as if to take something. The members of his suite, guessing
 23131	at once what he wanted, moved about and whispered as they passed
 23132	something from one to another, and a pageâthe same one RostÃ³v
 23133	had seen the previous evening at BorÃ­sââran forward and, bowing
 23134	respectfully over the outstretched hand and not keeping it waiting a
 23135	moment, laid in it an Order on a red ribbon. Napoleon, without looking,
 23136	pressed two fingers together and the badge was between them. Then he
 23137	approached LÃ¡zarev (who rolled his eyes and persistently gazed at his
 23138	own monarch), looked round at the Emperor Alexander to imply that what
 23139	he was now doing was done for the sake of his ally, and the small white
 23140	hand holding the Order touched one of LÃ¡zarevâs buttons. It was as if
 23141	Napoleon knew that it was only necessary for his hand to deign to touch
 23142	that soldierâs breast for the soldier to be forever happy, rewarded,
 23143	and distinguished from everyone else in the world. Napoleon merely laid
 23144	the cross on LÃ¡zarevâs breast and, dropping his hand, turned toward
 23145	Alexander as though sure that the cross would adhere there. And it
 23146	really did.
 23147	
 23148	Officious hands, Russian and French, immediately seized the cross and
 23149	fastened it to the uniform. LÃ¡zarev glanced morosely at the little
 23150	man with white hands who was doing something to him and, still standing
 23151	motionless presenting arms, looked again straight into Alexanderâs
 23152	eyes, as if asking whether he should stand there, or go away, or do
 23153	something else. But receiving no orders, he remained for some time in
 23154	that rigid position.
 23155	
 23156	The Emperors remounted and rode away. The PreobrazhÃ©nsk battalion,
 23157	breaking rank, mingled with the French Guards and sat down at the tables
 23158	prepared for them.
 23159	
 23160	LÃ¡zarev sat in the place of honor. Russian and French officers embraced
 23161	him, congratulated him, and pressed his hands. Crowds of officers and
 23162	civilians drew near merely to see him. A rumble of Russian and French
 23163	voices and laughter filled the air round the tables in the square.
 23164	Two officers with flushed faces, looking cheerful and happy, passed by
 23165	RostÃ³v.
 23166	
 23167	âWhat dâyou think of the treat? All on silver plate,â one of them
 23168	was saying. âHave you seen LÃ¡zarev?â
 23169	
 23170	âI have.â
 23171	
 23172	âTomorrow, I hear, the PreobrazhÃ©nskis will give them a dinner.â
 23173	
 23174	âYes, but what luck for LÃ¡zarev! Twelve hundred francsâ pension for
 23175	life.â
 23176	
 23177	âHereâs a cap, lads!â shouted a PreobrazhÃ©nsk soldier, donning a
 23178	shaggy French cap.
 23179	
 23180	âItâs a fine thing! First-rate!â
 23181	
 23182	âHave you heard the password?â asked one Guardsâ officer of
 23183	another. âThe day before yesterday it was âNapolÃ©on, France,
 23184	bravoureâ; yesterday, âAlexandre, Russie, grandeur.â One day our
 23185	Emperor gives it and next day Napoleon. Tomorrow our Emperor will send
 23186	a St. Georgeâs Cross to the bravest of the French Guards. It has to be
 23187	done. He must respond in kind.â
 23188	
 23189	BorÃ­s, too, with his friend ZhilÃ­nski, came to see the PreobrazhÃ©nsk
 23190	banquet. On his way back, he noticed RostÃ³v standing by the corner of a
 23191	house.
 23192	
 23193	âRostÃ³v! How dâyou do? We missed one another,â he said, and could
 23194	not refrain from asking what was the matter, so strangely dismal and
 23195	troubled was RostÃ³vâs face.
 23196	
 23197	âNothing, nothing,â replied RostÃ³v.
 23198	
 23199	âYouâll call round?â
 23200	
 23201	âYes, I will.â
 23202	
 23203	RostÃ³v stood at that corner for a long time, watching the feast from a
 23204	distance. In his mind, a painful process was going on which he could
 23205	not bring to a conclusion. Terrible doubts rose in his soul. Now he
 23206	remembered DenÃ­sov with his changed expression, his submission, and the
 23207	whole hospital, with arms and legs torn off and its dirt and disease. So
 23208	vividly did he recall that hospital stench of dead flesh that he
 23209	looked round to see where the smell came from. Next he thought of that
 23210	self-satisfied Bonaparte, with his small white hand, who was now an
 23211	Emperor, liked and respected by Alexander. Then why those severed
 23212	arms and legs and those dead men?... Then again he thought of LÃ¡zarev
 23213	rewarded and DenÃ­sov punished and unpardoned. He caught himself
 23214	harboring such strange thoughts that he was frightened.
 23215	
 23216	The smell of the food the PreobrazhÃ©nskis were eating and a sense of
 23217	hunger recalled him from these reflections; he had to get something to
 23218	eat before going away. He went to a hotel he had noticed that morning.
 23219	There he found so many people, among them officers who, like himself,
 23220	had come in civilian clothes, that he had difficulty in getting a
 23221	dinner. Two officers of his own division joined him. The conversation
 23222	naturally turned on the peace. The officers, his comrades, like most of
 23223	the army, were dissatisfied with the peace concluded after the battle of
 23224	Friedland. They said that had we held out a little longer Napoleon would
 23225	have been done for, as his troops had neither provisions nor ammunition.
 23226	Nicholas ate and drank (chiefly the latter) in silence. He finished a
 23227	couple of bottles of wine by himself. The process in his mind went on
 23228	tormenting him without reaching a conclusion. He feared to give way to
 23229	his thoughts, yet could not get rid of them. Suddenly, on one of the
 23230	officersâ saying that it was humiliating to look at the French,
 23231	RostÃ³v began shouting with uncalled-for wrath, and therefore much to
 23232	the surprise of the officers:
 23233	
 23234	âHow can you judge whatâs best?â he cried, the blood suddenly
 23235	rushing to his face. âHow can you judge the Emperorâs actions? What
 23236	right have we to argue? We cannot comprehend either the Emperorâs aims
 23237	or his actions!â
 23238	
 23239	âBut I never said a word about the Emperor!â said the officer,
 23240	justifying himself, and unable to understand RostÃ³vâs outburst,
 23241	except on the supposition that he was drunk.
 23242	
 23243	But RostÃ³v did not listen to him.
 23244	
 23245	âWe are not diplomatic officials, we are soldiers and nothing more,â
 23246	he went on. âIf we are ordered to die, we must die. If weâre
 23247	punished, it means that we have deserved it, itâs not for us to judge.
 23248	If the Emperor pleases to recognize Bonaparte as Emperor and to conclude
 23249	an alliance with him, it means that that is the right thing to do. If
 23250	once we begin judging and arguing about everything, nothing sacred
 23251	will be left! That way we shall be saying there is no Godânothing!â
 23252	shouted Nicholas, banging the tableâvery little to the point as it
 23253	seemed to his listeners, but quite relevantly to the course of his own
 23254	thoughts.
 23255	
 23256	âOur business is to do our duty, to fight and not to think! Thatâs
 23257	all....â said he.
 23258	
 23259	âAnd to drink,â said one of the officers, not wishing to quarrel.
 23260	
 23261	âYes, and to drink,â assented Nicholas. âHullo there! Another
 23262	bottle!â he shouted.
 23263	
 23264	In 1808 the Emperor Alexander went to Erfurt for a fresh interview with
 23265	the Emperor Napoleon, and in the upper circles of Petersburg there was
 23266	much talk of the grandeur of this important meeting.

 23273	
 23274	In 1809 the intimacy between âthe worldâs two arbiters,â as
 23275	Napoleon and Alexander were called, was such that when Napoleon declared
 23276	war on Austria a Russian corps crossed the frontier to co-operate with
 23277	our old enemy Bonaparte against our old ally the Emperor of Austria, and
 23278	in court circles the possibility of marriage between Napoleon and one
 23279	of Alexanderâs sisters was spoken of. But besides considerations of
 23280	foreign policy, the attention of Russian society was at that time keenly
 23281	directed on the internal changes that were being undertaken in all the
 23282	departments of government.
 23283	
 23284	Life meanwhileâreal life, with its essential interests of health and
 23285	sickness, toil and rest, and its intellectual interests in thought,
 23286	science, poetry, music, love, friendship, hatred, and passionsâwent on
 23287	as usual, independently of and apart from political friendship or enmity
 23288	with Napoleon Bonaparte and from all the schemes of reconstruction.

 23300	CHAPTER I
 23301	
 23302	Prince Andrew had spent two years continuously in the country.
 23303	
 23304	All the plans Pierre had attempted on his estatesâand constantly
 23305	changing from one thing to another had never accomplishedâwere carried
 23306	out by Prince Andrew without display and without perceptible difficulty.
 23307	
 23308	He had in the highest degree a practical tenacity which Pierre lacked,
 23309	and without fuss or strain on his part this set things going.
 23310	
 23311	On one of his estates the three hundred serfs were liberated and became
 23312	free agricultural laborersâthis being one of the first examples of
 23313	the kind in Russia. On other estates the serfsâ compulsory labor was
 23314	commuted for a quitrent. A trained midwife was engaged for BoguchÃ¡rovo
 23315	at his expense, and a priest was paid to teach reading and writing to
 23316	the children of the peasants and household serfs.
 23317	
 23318	Prince Andrew spent half his time at Bald Hills with his father and his
 23319	son, who was still in the care of nurses. The other half he spent in
 23320	âBoguchÃ¡rovo Cloister,â as his father called Prince Andrewâs
 23321	estate. Despite the indifference to the affairs of the world he had
 23322	expressed to Pierre, he diligently followed all that went on, received
 23323	many books, and to his surprise noticed that when he or his father had
 23324	visitors from Petersburg, the very vortex of life, these people lagged
 23325	behind himselfâwho never left the countryâin knowledge of what was
 23326	happening in home and foreign affairs.
 23327	
 23328	Besides being occupied with his estates and reading a great variety of
 23329	books, Prince Andrew was at this time busy with a critical survey of
 23330	our last two unfortunate campaigns, and with drawing up a proposal for a
 23331	reform of the army rules and regulations.
 23332	
 23333	In the spring of 1809 he went to visit the RyazÃ¡n estates which had
 23334	been inherited by his son, whose guardian he was.
 23335	
 23336	Warmed by the spring sunshine he sat in the calÃ¨che looking at the new
 23337	grass, the first leaves on the birches, and the first puffs of white
 23338	spring clouds floating across the clear blue sky. He was not thinking of
 23339	anything, but looked absent-mindedly and cheerfully from side to side.
 23340	
 23341	They crossed the ferry where he had talked with Pierre the year before.
 23342	They went through the muddy village, past threshing floors and green
 23343	fields of winter rye, downhill where snow still lodged near the bridge,
 23344	uphill where the clay had been liquefied by the rain, past strips of
 23345	stubble land and bushes touched with green here and there, and into a
 23346	birch forest growing on both sides of the road. In the forest it was
 23347	almost hot, no wind could be felt. The birches with their sticky green
 23348	leaves were motionless, and lilac-colored flowers and the first blades
 23349	of green grass were pushing up and lifting last yearâs leaves. The
 23350	coarse evergreen color of the small fir trees scattered here and there
 23351	among the birches was an unpleasant reminder of winter. On entering the
 23352	forest the horses began to snort and sweated visibly.
 23353	
 23354	Peter the footman made some remark to the coachman; the latter assented.
 23355	But apparently the coachmanâs sympathy was not enough for Peter, and
 23356	he turned on the box toward his master.
 23357	
 23358	âHow pleasant it is, your excellency!â he said with a respectful
 23359	smile.
 23360	
 23361	âWhat?â
 23362	
 23363	âItâs pleasant, your excellency!â
 23364	
 23365	âWhat is he talking about?â thought Prince Andrew. âOh, the
 23366	spring, I suppose,â he thought as he turned round. âYes, really
 23367	everything is green already.... How early! The birches and cherry and
 23368	alders too are coming out.... But the oaks show no sign yet. Ah, here is
 23369	one oak!â
 23370	
 23371	At the edge of the road stood an oak. Probably ten times the age of the
 23372	birches that formed the forest, it was ten times as thick and twice as
 23373	tall as they. It was an enormous tree, its girth twice as great as a
 23374	man could embrace, and evidently long ago some of its branches had been
 23375	broken off and its bark scarred. With its huge ungainly limbs sprawling
 23376	unsymmetrically, and its gnarled hands and fingers, it stood an aged,
 23377	stern, and scornful monster among the smiling birch trees. Only the
 23378	dead-looking evergreen firs dotted about in the forest, and this oak,
 23379	refused to yield to the charm of spring or notice either the spring or
 23380	the sunshine.
 23381	
 23382	âSpring, love, happiness!â this oak seemed to say. âAre you not
 23383	weary of that stupid, meaningless, constantly repeated fraud? Always the
 23384	same and always a fraud? There is no spring, no sun, no happiness! Look
 23385	at those cramped dead firs, ever the same, and at me too, sticking out
 23386	my broken and barked fingers just where they have grown, whether from my
 23387	back or my sides: as they have grown so I stand, and I do not believe in
 23388	your hopes and your lies.â
 23389	
 23390	As he passed through the forest Prince Andrew turned several times to
 23391	look at that oak, as if expecting something from it. Under the oak,
 23392	too, were flowers and grass, but it stood among them scowling, rigid,
 23393	misshapen, and grim as ever.
 23394	
 23395	âYes, the oak is right, a thousand times right,â thought Prince
 23396	Andrew. âLet othersâthe youngâyield afresh to that fraud, but we
 23397	know life, our life is finished!â
 23398	
 23399	A whole sequence of new thoughts, hopeless but mournfully pleasant, rose
 23400	in his soul in connection with that tree. During this journey he, as
 23401	it were, considered his life afresh and arrived at his old conclusion,
 23402	restful in its hopelessness: that it was not for him to begin anything
 23403	anewâbut that he must live out his life, content to do no harm, and
 23404	not disturbing himself or desiring anything.
 23405	
 23406	
 23407	
 23408	
 23409	
 23410	CHAPTER II
 23411	
 23412	Prince Andrew had to see the Marshal of the Nobility for the district
 23413	in connection with the affairs of the RyazÃ¡n estate of which he was
 23414	trustee. This Marshal was Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v, and in the middle of May
 23415	Prince Andrew went to visit him.
 23416	
 23417	It was now hot spring weather. The whole forest was already clothed in
 23418	green. It was dusty and so hot that on passing near water one longed to
 23419	bathe.
 23420	
 23421	Prince Andrew, depressed and preoccupied with the business about which
 23422	he had to speak to the Marshal, was driving up the avenue in the grounds
 23423	of the RostÃ³vsâ house at OtrÃ¡dnoe. He heard merry girlish cries
 23424	behind some trees on the right and saw a group of girls running to cross
 23425	the path of his calÃ¨che. Ahead of the rest and nearer to him ran a
 23426	dark-haired, remarkably slim, pretty girl in a yellow chintz dress, with
 23427	a white handkerchief on her head from under which loose locks of hair
 23428	escaped. The girl was shouting something but, seeing that he was a
 23429	stranger, ran back laughing without looking at him.
 23430	
 23431	Suddenly, he did not know why, he felt a pang. The day was so beautiful,
 23432	the sun so bright, everything around so gay, but that slim pretty girl
 23433	did not know, or wish to know, of his existence and was contented and
 23434	cheerful in her own separateâprobably foolishâbut bright and happy
 23435	life. âWhat is she so glad about? What is she thinking of? Not of
 23436	the military regulations or of the arrangement of the RyazÃ¡n serfsâ
 23437	quitrents. Of what is she thinking? Why is she so happy?â Prince
 23438	Andrew asked himself with instinctive curiosity.
 23439	
 23440	In 1809 Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v was living at OtrÃ¡dnoe just as he had done
 23441	in former years, that is, entertaining almost the whole province with
 23442	hunts, theatricals, dinners, and music. He was glad to see Prince
 23443	Andrew, as he was to see any new visitor, and insisted on his staying
 23444	the night.
 23445	
 23446	During the dull day, in the course of which he was entertained by
 23447	his elderly hosts and by the more important of the visitors (the old
 23448	countâs house was crowded on account of an approaching name day),
 23449	Prince Andrew repeatedly glanced at NatÃ¡sha, gay and laughing among the
 23450	younger members of the company, and asked himself each time, âWhat is
 23451	she thinking about? Why is she so glad?â
 23452	
 23453	That night, alone in new surroundings, he was long unable to sleep. He
 23454	read awhile and then put out his candle, but relit it. It was hot in the
 23455	room, the inside shutters of which were closed. He was cross with the
 23456	stupid old man (as he called RostÃ³v), who had made him stay by assuring
 23457	him that some necessary documents had not yet arrived from town, and he
 23458	was vexed with himself for having stayed.
 23459	
 23460	He got up and went to the window to open it. As soon as he opened the
 23461	shutters the moonlight, as if it had long been watching for this, burst
 23462	into the room. He opened the casement. The night was fresh, bright, and
 23463	very still. Just before the window was a row of pollard trees, looking
 23464	black on one side and with a silvery light on the other. Beneath the
 23465	trees grew some kind of lush, wet, bushy vegetation with silver-lit
 23466	leaves and stems here and there. Farther back beyond the dark trees a
 23467	roof glittered with dew, to the right was a leafy tree with brilliantly
 23468	white trunk and branches, and above it shone the moon, nearly at its
 23469	full, in a pale, almost starless, spring sky. Prince Andrew leaned his
 23470	elbows on the window ledge and his eyes rested on that sky.
 23471	
 23472	His room was on the first floor. Those in the rooms above were also
 23473	awake. He heard female voices overhead.
 23474	
 23475	âJust once more,â said a girlish voice above him which Prince Andrew
 23476	recognized at once.
 23477	
 23478	âBut when are you coming to bed?â replied another voice.
 23479	
 23480	âI wonât, I canât sleep, whatâs the use? Come now for the last
 23481	time.â
 23482	
 23483	Two girlish voices sang a musical passageâthe end of some song.
 23484	
 23485	âOh, how lovely! Now go to sleep, and thereâs an end of it.â
 23486	
 23487	âYou go to sleep, but I canât,â said the first voice, coming
 23488	nearer to the window. She was evidently leaning right out, for the
 23489	rustle of her dress and even her breathing could be heard. Everything
 23490	was stone-still, like the moon and its light and the shadows. Prince
 23491	Andrew, too, dared not stir, for fear of betraying his unintentional
 23492	presence.
 23493	
 23494	âSÃ³nya! SÃ³nya!â he again heard the first speaker. âOh, how can
 23495	you sleep? Only look how glorious it is! Ah, how glorious! Do wake up,
 23496	SÃ³nya!â she said almost with tears in her voice. âThere never,
 23497	never was such a lovely night before!â
 23498	
 23499	SÃ³nya made some reluctant reply.
 23500	
 23501	âDo just come and see what a moon!... Oh, how lovely! Come here....
 23502	Darling, sweetheart, come here! There, you see? I feel like sitting down
 23503	on my heels, putting my arms round my knees like this, straining tight,
 23504	as tight as possible, and flying away! Like this....â
 23505	
 23506	âTake care, youâll fall out.â
 23507	
 23508	He heard the sound of a scuffle and SÃ³nyaâs disapproving voice:
 23509	âItâs past one oâclock.â
 23510	
 23511	âOh, you only spoil things for me. All right, go, go!â
 23512	
 23513	Again all was silent, but Prince Andrew knew she was still sitting
 23514	there. From time to time he heard a soft rustle and at times a sigh.
 23515	
 23516	âO God, O God! What does it mean?â she suddenly exclaimed. âTo bed
 23517	then, if it must be!â and she slammed the casement.
 23518	
 23519	âFor her I might as well not exist!â thought Prince Andrew while he
 23520	listened to her voice, for some reason expecting yet fearing that she
 23521	might say something about him. âThere she is again! As if it were on
 23522	purpose,â thought he.
 23523	
 23524	In his soul there suddenly arose such an unexpected turmoil of youthful
 23525	thoughts and hopes, contrary to the whole tenor of his life, that unable
 23526	to explain his condition to himself he lay down and fell asleep at once.
 23527	
 23528	
 23529	
 23530	
 23531	
 23532	CHAPTER III
 23533	
 23534	Next morning, having taken leave of no one but the count, and not
 23535	waiting for the ladies to appear, Prince Andrew set off for home.
 23536	
 23537	It was already the beginning of June when on his return journey he drove
 23538	into the birch forest where the gnarled old oak had made so strange and
 23539	memorable an impression on him. In the forest the harness bells sounded
 23540	yet more muffled than they had done six weeks before, for now all was
 23541	thick, shady, and dense, and the young firs dotted about in the forest
 23542	did not jar on the general beauty but, lending themselves to the mood
 23543	around, were delicately green with fluffy young shoots.
 23544	
 23545	The whole day had been hot. Somewhere a storm was gathering, but only
 23546	a small cloud had scattered some raindrops lightly, sprinkling the road
 23547	and the sappy leaves. The left side of the forest was dark in the shade,
 23548	the right side glittered in the sunlight, wet and shiny and scarcely
 23549	swayed by the breeze. Everything was in blossom, the nightingales
 23550	trilled, and their voices reverberated now near, now far away.
 23551	
 23552	âYes, here in this forest was that oak with which I agreed,â thought
 23553	Prince Andrew. âBut where is it?â he again wondered, gazing at
 23554	the left side of the road, and without recognizing it he looked with
 23555	admiration at the very oak he sought. The old oak, quite transfigured,
 23556	spreading out a canopy of sappy dark-green foliage, stood rapt and
 23557	slightly trembling in the rays of the evening sun. Neither gnarled
 23558	fingers nor old scars nor old doubts and sorrows were any of them in
 23559	evidence now. Through the hard century-old bark, even where there were
 23560	no twigs, leaves had sprouted such as one could hardly believe the old
 23561	veteran could have produced.
 23562	
 23563	âYes, it is the same oak,â thought Prince Andrew, and all at once he
 23564	was seized by an unreasoning springtime feeling of joy and renewal. All
 23565	the best moments of his life suddenly rose to his memory. Austerlitz
 23566	with the lofty heavens, his wifeâs dead reproachful face, Pierre at
 23567	the ferry, that girl thrilled by the beauty of the night, and that night
 23568	itself and the moon, and... all this rushed suddenly to his mind.
 23569	
 23570	âNo, life is not over at thirty-one!â Prince Andrew suddenly decided
 23571	finally and decisively. âIt is not enough for me to know what I have
 23572	in meâeveryone must know it: Pierre, and that young girl who wanted to
 23573	fly away into the sky, everyone must know me, so that my life may not be
 23574	lived for myself alone while others live so apart from it, but so that
 23575	it may be reflected in them all, and they and I may live in harmony!â
 23576	
 23577	
 23578	On reaching home Prince Andrew decided to go to Petersburg that autumn
 23579	and found all sorts of reasons for this decision. A whole series of
 23580	sensible and logical considerations showing it to be essential for him
 23581	to go to Petersburg, and even to re-enter the service, kept springing
 23582	up in his mind. He could not now understand how he could ever even have
 23583	doubted the necessity of taking an active share in life, just as a month
 23584	before he had not understood how the idea of leaving the quiet country
 23585	could ever enter his head. It now seemed clear to him that all his
 23586	experience of life must be senselessly wasted unless he applied it to
 23587	some kind of work and again played an active part in life. He did not
 23588	even remember how formerly, on the strength of similar wretched logical
 23589	arguments, it had seemed obvious that he would be degrading himself if
 23590	he now, after the lessons he had had in life, allowed himself to believe
 23591	in the possibility of being useful and in the possibility of happiness
 23592	or love. Now reason suggested quite the opposite. After that journey
 23593	to RyazÃ¡n he found the country dull; his former pursuits no longer
 23594	interested him, and often when sitting alone in his study he got up,
 23595	went to the mirror, and gazed a long time at his own face. Then he would
 23596	turn away to the portrait of his dead Lise, who with hair curled Ã  la
 23597	grecque looked tenderly and gaily at him out of the gilt frame. She
 23598	did not now say those former terrible words to him, but looked simply,
 23599	merrily, and inquisitively at him. And Prince Andrew, crossing his
 23600	arms behind him, long paced the room, now frowning, now smiling, as
 23601	he reflected on those irrational, inexpressible thoughts, secret as a
 23602	crime, which altered his whole life and were connected with Pierre, with
 23603	fame, with the girl at the window, the oak, and womanâs beauty
 23604	and love. And if anyone came into his room at such moments he was
 23605	particularly cold, stern, and above all unpleasantly logical.
 23606	
 23607	âMy dear,â Princess Mary entering at such a moment would say,
 23608	âlittle Nicholas canât go out today, itâs very cold.â
 23609	
 23610	âIf it were hot,â Prince Andrew would reply at such times very dryly
 23611	to his sister, âhe could go out in his smock, but as it is cold he
 23612	must wear warm clothes, which were designed for that purpose. That is
 23613	what follows from the fact that it is cold; and not that a child who
 23614	needs fresh air should remain at home,â he would add with extreme
 23615	logic, as if punishing someone for those secret illogical emotions that
 23616	stirred within him.
 23617	
 23618	At such moments Princess Mary would think how intellectual work dries
 23619	men up.
 23620	
 23621	
 23622	
 23623	
 23624	
 23625	CHAPTER IV
 23626	
 23627	Prince Andrew arrived in Petersburg in August, 1809. It was the time
 23628	when the youthful SperÃ¡nski was at the zenith of his fame and his
 23629	reforms were being pushed forward with the greatest energy. That same
 23630	August the Emperor was thrown from his calÃ¨che, injured his leg, and
 23631	remained three weeks at Peterhof, receiving SperÃ¡nski every day and no
 23632	one else. At that time the two famous decrees were being prepared
 23633	that so agitated societyâabolishing court ranks and introducing
 23634	examinations to qualify for the grades of Collegiate Assessor and
 23635	State Councilorâand not merely these but a whole state constitution,
 23636	intended to change the existing order of government in Russia: legal,
 23637	administrative, and financial, from the Council of State down to the
 23638	district tribunals. Now those vague liberal dreams with which the
 23639	Emperor Alexander had ascended the throne, and which he had tried to put
 23640	into effect with the aid of his associates, CzartorÃ½ski, NovosÃ­ltsev,
 23641	KochubÃ©y, and StrÃ³gonovâwhom he himself in jest had called his
 23642	ComitÃ© de salut publicâwere taking shape and being realized.
 23643	
 23644	Now all these men were replaced by SperÃ¡nski on the civil side, and
 23645	ArakchÃ©ev on the military. Soon after his arrival Prince Andrew, as a
 23646	gentleman of the chamber, presented himself at court and at a levee. The
 23647	Emperor, though he met him twice, did not favor him with a single word.
 23648	It had always seemed to Prince Andrew before that he was antipathetic
 23649	to the Emperor and that the latter disliked his face and personality
 23650	generally, and in the cold, repellent glance the Emperor gave him, he
 23651	now found further confirmation of this surmise. The courtiers explained
 23652	the Emperorâs neglect of him by His Majestyâs displeasure at
 23653	BolkÃ³nskiâs not having served since 1805.
 23654	
 23655	âI know myself that one cannot help oneâs sympathies and
 23656	antipathies,â thought Prince Andrew, âso it will not do to present
 23657	my proposal for the reform of the army regulations to the Emperor
 23658	personally, but the project will speak for itself.â
 23659	
 23660	He mentioned what he had written to an old field marshal, a friend
 23661	of his fatherâs. The field marshal made an appointment to see him,
 23662	received him graciously, and promised to inform the Emperor. A few
 23663	days later Prince Andrew received notice that he was to go to see the
 23664	Minister of War, Count ArakchÃ©ev.
 23665	
 23666	
 23667	On the appointed day Prince Andrew entered Count ArakchÃ©evâs waiting
 23668	room at nine in the morning.
 23669	
 23670	He did not know ArakchÃ©ev personally, had never seen him, and all he
 23671	had heard of him inspired him with but little respect for the man.
 23672	
 23673	âHe is Minister of War, a man trusted by the Emperor, and I need not
 23674	concern myself about his personal qualities: he has been commissioned to
 23675	consider my project, so he alone can get it adopted,â thought Prince
 23676	Andrew as he waited among a number of important and unimportant people
 23677	in Count ArakchÃ©evâs waiting room.
 23678	
 23679	During his service, chiefly as an adjutant, Prince Andrew had seen the
 23680	anterooms of many important men, and the different types of such rooms
 23681	were well known to him. Count ArakchÃ©evâs anteroom had quite a
 23682	special character. The faces of the unimportant people awaiting their
 23683	turn for an audience showed embarrassment and servility; the faces of
 23684	those of higher rank expressed a common feeling of awkwardness, covered
 23685	by a mask of unconcern and ridicule of themselves, their situation, and
 23686	the person for whom they were waiting. Some walked thoughtfully up and
 23687	down, others whispered and laughed. Prince Andrew heard the nickname
 23688	âSÃ­la AndrÃ©evichâ and the words, âUncle will give it to us
 23689	hot,â in reference to Count ArakchÃ©ev. One general (an important
 23690	personage), evidently feeling offended at having to wait so long, sat
 23691	crossing and uncrossing his legs and smiling contemptuously to himself.
 23692	
 23693	But the moment the door opened one feeling alone appeared on all
 23694	facesâthat of fear. Prince Andrew for the second time asked the
 23695	adjutant on duty to take in his name, but received an ironical look and
 23696	was told that his turn would come in due course. After some others had
 23697	been shown in and out of the ministerâs room by the adjutant on duty,
 23698	an officer who struck Prince Andrew by his humiliated and frightened air
 23699	was admitted at that terrible door. This officerâs audience lasted a
 23700	long time. Then suddenly the grating sound of a harsh voice was heard
 23701	from the other side of the door, and the officerâwith pale face and
 23702	trembling lipsâcame out and passed through the waiting room, clutching
 23703	his head.
 23704	
 23705	After this Prince Andrew was conducted to the door and the officer on
 23706	duty said in a whisper, âTo the right, at the window.â
 23707	
 23708	Prince Andrew entered a plain tidy room and saw at the table a man of
 23709	forty with a long waist, a long closely cropped head, deep wrinkles,
 23710	scowling brows above dull greenish-hazel eyes and an overhanging red
 23711	nose. ArakchÃ©ev turned his head toward him without looking at him.
 23712	
 23713	âWhat is your petition?â asked ArakchÃ©ev.
 23714	
 23715	âI am not petitioning, your excellency,â returned Prince Andrew
 23716	quietly.
 23717	
 23718	ArakchÃ©evâs eyes turned toward him.
 23719	
 23720	âSit down,â said he. âPrince BolkÃ³nski?â
 23721	
 23722	âI am not petitioning about anything. His Majesty the Emperor has
 23723	deigned to send your excellency a project submitted by me...â
 23724	
 23725	âYou see, my dear sir, I have read your project,â interrupted
 23726	ArakchÃ©ev, uttering only the first words amiably and thenâagain
 23727	without looking at Prince Andrewârelapsing gradually into a tone of
 23728	grumbling contempt. âYou are proposing new military laws? There are
 23729	many laws but no one to carry out the old ones. Nowadays everybody
 23730	designs laws, it is easier writing than doing.â
 23731	
 23732	âI came at His Majesty the Emperorâs wish to learn from your
 23733	excellency how you propose to deal with the memorandum I have
 23734	presented,â said Prince Andrew politely.
 23735	
 23736	âI have endorsed a resolution on your memorandum and sent it to the
 23737	committee. I do not approve of it,â said ArakchÃ©ev, rising and taking
 23738	a paper from his writing table. âHere!â and he handed it to Prince
 23739	Andrew.
 23740	
 23741	Across the paper was scrawled in pencil, without capital letters,
 23742	misspelled, and without punctuation: âUnsoundly constructed because
 23743	resembles an imitation of the French military code and from the Articles
 23744	of War needlessly deviating.â
 23745	
 23746	âTo what committee has the memorandum been referred?â inquired
 23747	Prince Andrew.
 23748	
 23749	âTo the Committee on Army Regulations, and I have recommended that
 23750	your honor should be appointed a member, but without a salary.â
 23751	
 23752	Prince Andrew smiled.
 23753	
 23754	âI donât want one.â
 23755	
 23756	âA member without salary,â repeated ArakchÃ©ev. âI have the
 23757	honor... Eh! Call the next one! Who else is there?â he shouted, bowing
 23758	to Prince Andrew.
 23759	
 23760	
 23761	
 23762	
 23763	
 23764	CHAPTER V
 23765	
 23766	While waiting for the announcement of his appointment to the committee
 23767	Prince Andrew looked up his former acquaintances, particularly those he
 23768	knew to be in power and whose aid he might need. In Petersburg he now
 23769	experienced the same feeling he had had on the eve of a battle, when
 23770	troubled by anxious curiosity and irresistibly attracted to the ruling
 23771	circles where the future, on which the fate of millions depended, was
 23772	being shaped. From the irritation of the older men, the curiosity of the
 23773	uninitiated, the reserve of the initiated, the hurry and preoccupation
 23774	of everyone, and the innumerable committees and commissions of whose
 23775	existence he learned every day, he felt that now, in 1809, here in
 23776	Petersburg a vast civil conflict was in preparation, the commander in
 23777	chief of which was a mysterious person he did not know, but who was
 23778	supposed to be a man of geniusâSperÃ¡nski. And this movement of
 23779	reconstruction of which Prince Andrew had a vague idea, and SperÃ¡nski
 23780	its chief promoter, began to interest him so keenly that the question
 23781	of the army regulations quickly receded to a secondary place in his
 23782	consciousness.
 23783	
 23784	Prince Andrew was most favorably placed to secure good reception in the
 23785	highest and most diverse Petersburg circles of the day. The reforming
 23786	party cordially welcomed and courted him, in the first place because
 23787	he was reputed to be clever and very well read, and secondly because by
 23788	liberating his serfs he had obtained the reputation of being a liberal.
 23789	The party of the old and dissatisfied, who censured the innovations,
 23790	turned to him expecting his sympathy in their disapproval of the
 23791	reforms, simply because he was the son of his father. The feminine
 23792	society world welcomed him gladly, because he was rich, distinguished, a
 23793	good match, and almost a newcomer, with a halo of romance on account
 23794	of his supposed death and the tragic loss of his wife. Besides this
 23795	the general opinion of all who had known him previously was that he had
 23796	greatly improved during these last five years, having softened and grown
 23797	more manly, lost his former affectation, pride, and contemptuous irony,
 23798	and acquired the serenity that comes with years. People talked about
 23799	him, were interested in him, and wanted to meet him.
 23800	
 23801	The day after his interview with Count ArakchÃ©ev, Prince Andrew spent
 23802	the evening at Count KochubÃ©yâs. He told the count of his interview
 23803	with SÃ­la AndrÃ©evich (KochubÃ©y spoke of ArakchÃ©ev by that nickname
 23804	with the same vague irony Prince Andrew had noticed in the Minister of
 23805	Warâs anteroom).
 23806	
 23807	âMon cher, even in this case you canât do without Michael
 23808	MikhÃ¡ylovich SperÃ¡nski. He manages everything. Iâll speak to him. He
 23809	has promised to come this evening.â
 23810	
 23811	âWhat has SperÃ¡nski to do with the army regulations?â asked Prince
 23812	Andrew.
 23813	
 23814	KochubÃ©y shook his head smilingly, as if surprised at BolkÃ³nskiâs
 23815	simplicity.
 23816	
 23817	âWe were talking to him about you a few days ago,â KochubÃ©y
 23818	continued, âand about your freed plowmen.â
 23819	
 23820	âOh, is it you, Prince, who have freed your serfs?â said an old man
 23821	of Catherineâs day, turning contemptuously toward BolkÃ³nski.
 23822	
 23823	âIt was a small estate that brought in no profit,â replied Prince
 23824	Andrew, trying to extenuate his action so as not to irritate the old man
 23825	uselessly.
 23826	
 23827	âAfraid of being late...â said the old man, looking at KochubÃ©y.
 23828	
 23829	âThereâs one thing I donât understand,â he continued. âWho
 23830	will plow the land if they are set free? It is easy to write laws, but
 23831	difficult to rule.... Just the same as nowâI ask you, Countâwho will
 23832	be heads of the departments when everybody has to pass examinations?â
 23833	
 23834	âThose who pass the examinations, I suppose,â replied KochubÃ©y,
 23835	crossing his legs and glancing round.
 23836	
 23837	âWell, I have PryÃ¡nichnikov serving under me, a splendid man, a
 23838	priceless man, but heâs sixty. Is he to go up for examination?â
 23839	
 23840	âYes, thatâs a difficulty, as education is not at all general,
 23841	but...â
 23842	
 23843	Count KochubÃ©y did not finish. He rose, took Prince Andrew by the arm,
 23844	and went to meet a tall, bald, fair man of about forty with a large open
 23845	forehead and a long face of unusual and peculiar whiteness, who was
 23846	just entering. The newcomer wore a blue swallow-tail coat with a
 23847	cross suspended from his neck and a star on his left breast. It was
 23848	SperÃ¡nski. Prince Andrew recognized him at once, and felt a throb
 23849	within him, as happens at critical moments of life. Whether it was from
 23850	respect, envy, or anticipation, he did not know. SperÃ¡nskiâs whole
 23851	figure was of a peculiar type that made him easily recognizable. In
 23852	the society in which Prince Andrew lived he had never seen anyone who
 23853	together with awkward and clumsy gestures possessed such calmness and
 23854	self-assurance; he had never seen so resolute yet gentle an expression
 23855	as that in those half-closed, rather humid eyes, or so firm a smile that
 23856	expressed nothing; nor had he heard such a refined, smooth, soft
 23857	voice; above all he had never seen such delicate whiteness of face or
 23858	handsâhands which were broad, but very plump, soft, and white. Such
 23859	whiteness and softness Prince Andrew had only seen on the faces of
 23860	soldiers who had been long in hospital. This was SperÃ¡nski, Secretary
 23861	of State, reporter to the Emperor and his companion at Erfurt, where he
 23862	had more than once met and talked with Napoleon.
 23863	
 23864	SperÃ¡nski did not shift his eyes from one face to another as people
 23865	involuntarily do on entering a large company and was in no hurry to
 23866	speak. He spoke slowly, with assurance that he would be listened to, and
 23867	he looked only at the person with whom he was conversing.
 23868	
 23869	Prince Andrew followed SperÃ¡nskiâs every word and movement with
 23870	particular attention. As happens to some people, especially to men
 23871	who judge those near to them severely, he always on meeting
 23872	anyone newâespecially anyone whom, like SperÃ¡nski, he knew by
 23873	reputationâexpected to discover in him the perfection of human
 23874	qualities.
 23875	
 23876	SperÃ¡nski told KochubÃ©y he was sorry he had been unable to come sooner
 23877	as he had been detained at the palace. He did not say that the Emperor
 23878	had kept him, and Prince Andrew noticed this affectation of modesty.
 23879	When KochubÃ©y introduced Prince Andrew, SperÃ¡nski slowly turned
 23880	his eyes to BolkÃ³nski with his customary smile and looked at him in
 23881	silence.
 23882	
 23883	âI am very glad to make your acquaintance. I had heard of you, as
 23884	everyone has,â he said after a pause.
 23885	
 23886	KochubÃ©y said a few words about the reception ArakchÃ©ev had given
 23887	BolkÃ³nski. SperÃ¡nski smiled more markedly.
 23888	
 23889	âThe chairman of the Committee on Army Regulations is my good friend
 23890	Monsieur MagnÃ­tski,â he said, fully articulating every word and
 23891	syllable, âand if you like I can put you in touch with him.â He
 23892	paused at the full stop. âI hope you will find him sympathetic and
 23893	ready to co-operate in promoting all that is reasonable.â
 23894	
 23895	A circle soon formed round SperÃ¡nski, and the old man who had talked
 23896	about his subordinate PryÃ¡nichnikov addressed a question to him.
 23897	
 23898	Prince Andrew without joining in the conversation watched every movement
 23899	of SperÃ¡nskiâs: this man, not long since an insignificant divinity
 23900	student, who now, BolkÃ³nski thought, held in his handsâthose plump
 23901	white handsâthe fate of Russia. Prince Andrew was struck by the
 23902	extraordinarily disdainful composure with which SperÃ¡nski answered
 23903	the old man. He appeared to address condescending words to him from
 23904	an immeasurable height. When the old man began to speak too loud,
 23905	SperÃ¡nski smiled and said he could not judge of the advantage or
 23906	disadvantage of what pleased the sovereign.
 23907	
 23908	Having talked for a little while in the general circle, SperÃ¡nski rose
 23909	and coming up to Prince Andrew took him along to the other end of the
 23910	room. It was clear that he thought it necessary to interest himself in
 23911	BolkÃ³nski.
 23912	
 23913	âI had no chance to talk with you, Prince, during the animated
 23914	conversation in which that venerable gentleman involved me,â he said
 23915	with a mildly contemptuous smile, as if intimating by that smile that he
 23916	and Prince Andrew understood the insignificance of the people with whom
 23917	he had just been talking. This flattered Prince Andrew. âI have known
 23918	of you for a long time: first from your action with regard to your
 23919	serfs, a first example, of which it is very desirable that there should
 23920	be more imitators; and secondly because you are one of those gentlemen
 23921	of the chamber who have not considered themselves offended by the new
 23922	decree concerning the ranks allotted to courtiers, which is causing so
 23923	much gossip and tittle-tattle.â
 23924	
 23925	âNo,â said Prince Andrew, âmy father did not wish me to take
 23926	advantage of the privilege. I began the service from the lower grade.â
 23927	
 23928	âYour father, a man of the last century, evidently stands above our
 23929	contemporaries who so condemn this measure which merely re-establishes
 23930	natural justice.â
 23931	
 23932	âI think, however, that these condemnations have some ground,â
 23933	returned Prince Andrew, trying to resist SperÃ¡nskiâs influence, of
 23934	which he began to be conscious. He did not like to agree with him in
 23935	everything and felt a wish to contradict. Though he usually spoke easily
 23936	and well, he felt a difficulty in expressing himself now while talking
 23937	with SperÃ¡nski. He was too much absorbed in observing the famous
 23938	manâs personality.
 23939	
 23940	âGrounds of personal ambition maybe,â SperÃ¡nski put in quietly.
 23941	
 23942	âAnd of state interest to some extent,â said Prince Andrew.
 23943	
 23944	âWhat do you mean?â asked SperÃ¡nski quietly, lowering his eyes.
 23945	
 23946	âI am an admirer of Montesquieu,â replied Prince Andrew, âand
 23947	his idea that le principe des monarchies est lâhonneur me paraÃ®t
 23948	incontestable. Certains droits et privilÃ¨ges de la noblesse me
 23949	paraissent Ãªtre des moyens de soutenir ce sentiment.â *
 23950	
 23951	     * âThe principle of monarchies is honor seems to me
 23952	     incontestable. Certain rights and privileges for the
 23953	     aristocracy appear to me a means of maintaining that
 23954	     sentiment.â
 23955	
 23956	
 23957	The smile vanished from SperÃ¡nskiâs white face, which was much
 23958	improved by the change. Probably Prince Andrewâs thought interested
 23959	him.
 23960	
 23961	âSi vous envisagez la question sous ce point de vue,â * he began,
 23962	pronouncing French with evident difficulty, and speaking even slower
 23963	than in Russian but quite calmly.
 23964	
 23965	    * âIf you regard the question from that point of view.â
 23966	
 23967	
 23968	SperÃ¡nski went on to say that honor, lâhonneur, cannot be upheld by
 23969	privileges harmful to the service; that honor, lâhonneur, is either a
 23970	negative concept of not doing what is blameworthy or it is a source of
 23971	emulation in pursuit of commendation and rewards, which recognize it.
 23972	His arguments were concise, simple, and clear.
 23973	
 23974	âAn institution upholding honor, the source of emulation, is one
 23975	similar to the LÃ©gion dâhonneur of the great Emperor Napoleon, not
 23976	harmful but helpful to the success of the service, but not a class or
 23977	court privilege.â
 23978	
 23979	âI do not dispute that, but it cannot be denied that court privileges
 23980	have attained the same end,â returned Prince Andrew. âEvery courtier
 23981	considers himself bound to maintain his position worthily.â
 23982	
 23983	âYet you do not care to avail yourself of the privilege, Prince,â
 23984	said SperÃ¡nski, indicating by a smile that he wished to finish amiably
 23985	an argument which was embarrassing for his companion. âIf you will
 23986	do me the honor of calling on me on Wednesday,â he added, âI will,
 23987	after talking with MagnÃ­tski, let you know what may interest you, and
 23988	shall also have the pleasure of a more detailed chat with you.â
 23989	
 23990	Closing his eyes, he bowed Ã  la franÃ§aise, without taking leave, and
 23991	trying to attract as little attention as possible, he left the room.
 23992	
 23993	
 23994	
 23995	
 23996	
 23997	CHAPTER VI
 23998	
 23999	During the first weeks of his stay in Petersburg Prince Andrew felt the
 24000	whole trend of thought he had formed during his life of seclusion quite
 24001	overshadowed by the trifling cares that engrossed him in that city.
 24002	
 24003	On returning home in the evening he would jot down in his notebook four
 24004	or five necessary calls or appointments for certain hours. The mechanism
 24005	of life, the arrangement of the day so as to be in time everywhere,
 24006	absorbed the greater part of his vital energy. He did nothing, did
 24007	not even think or find time to think, but only talked, and talked
 24008	successfully, of what he had thought while in the country.
 24009	
 24010	He sometimes noticed with dissatisfaction that he repeated the same
 24011	remark on the same day in different circles. But he was so busy for
 24012	whole days together that he had no time to notice that he was thinking
 24013	of nothing.
 24014	
 24015	As he had done on their first meeting at KochubÃ©yâs, SperÃ¡nski
 24016	produced a strong impression on Prince Andrew on the Wednesday, when he
 24017	received him tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte at his own house and talked to him long and
 24018	confidentially.
 24019	
 24020	To BolkÃ³nski so many people appeared contemptible and insignificant
 24021	creatures, and he so longed to find in someone the living ideal of that
 24022	perfection toward which he strove, that he readily believed that in
 24023	SperÃ¡nski he had found this ideal of a perfectly rational and virtuous
 24024	man. Had SperÃ¡nski sprung from the same class as himself and possessed
 24025	the same breeding and traditions, BolkÃ³nski would soon have discovered
 24026	his weak, human, unheroic sides; but as it was, SperÃ¡nskiâs strange
 24027	and logical turn of mind inspired him with respect all the more because
 24028	he did not quite understand him. Moreover, SperÃ¡nski, either because he
 24029	appreciated the otherâs capacity or because he considered it necessary
 24030	to win him to his side, showed off his dispassionate calm reasonableness
 24031	before Prince Andrew and flattered him with that subtle flattery which
 24032	goes hand in hand with self-assurance and consists in a tacit assumption
 24033	that oneâs companion is the only man besides oneself capable of
 24034	understanding the folly of the rest of mankind and the reasonableness
 24035	and profundity of oneâs own ideas.
 24036	
 24037	During their long conversation on Wednesday evening, SperÃ¡nski more
 24038	than once remarked: âWe regard everything that is above the common
 24039	level of rooted custom...â or, with a smile: âBut we want the wolves
 24040	to be fed and the sheep to be safe...â or: âThey cannot understand
 24041	this...â and all in a way that seemed to say: âWe, you and I,
 24042	understand what they are and who we are.â
 24043	
 24044	This first long conversation with SperÃ¡nski only strengthened in Prince
 24045	Andrew the feeling he had experienced toward him at their first meeting.
 24046	He saw in him a remarkable, clear-thinking man of vast intellect who by
 24047	his energy and persistence had attained power, which he was using solely
 24048	for the welfare of Russia. In Prince Andrewâs eyes SperÃ¡nski was the
 24049	man he would himself have wished to beâone who explained all the facts
 24050	of life reasonably, considered important only what was rational, and
 24051	was capable of applying the standard of reason to everything. Everything
 24052	seemed so simple and clear in SperÃ¡nskiâs exposition that Prince
 24053	Andrew involuntarily agreed with him about everything. If he replied and
 24054	argued, it was only because he wished to maintain his independence and
 24055	not submit to SperÃ¡nskiâs opinions entirely. Everything was right
 24056	and everything was as it should be: only one thing disconcerted Prince
 24057	Andrew. This was SperÃ¡nskiâs cold, mirrorlike look, which did not
 24058	allow one to penetrate to his soul, and his delicate white hands, which
 24059	Prince Andrew involuntarily watched as one does watch the hands of
 24060	those who possess power. This mirrorlike gaze and those delicate hands
 24061	irritated Prince Andrew, he knew not why. He was unpleasantly
 24062	struck, too, by the excessive contempt for others that he observed in
 24063	SperÃ¡nski, and by the diversity of lines of argument he used to
 24064	support his opinions. He made use of every kind of mental device, except
 24065	analogy, and passed too boldly, it seemed to Prince Andrew, from one
 24066	to another. Now he would take up the position of a practical man and
 24067	condemn dreamers; now that of a satirist, and laugh ironically at his
 24068	opponents; now grow severely logical, or suddenly rise to the realm of
 24069	metaphysics. (This last resource was one he very frequently employed.)
 24070	He would transfer a question to metaphysical heights, pass on to
 24071	definitions of space, time, and thought, and, having deduced the
 24072	refutation he needed, would again descend to the level of the original
 24073	discussion.
 24074	
 24075	In general the trait of SperÃ¡nskiâs mentality which struck Prince
 24076	Andrew most was his absolute and unshakable belief in the power and
 24077	authority of reason. It was evident that the thought could never occur
 24078	to him which to Prince Andrew seemed so natural, namely, that it is
 24079	after all impossible to express all one thinks; and that he had never
 24080	felt the doubt, âIs not all I think and believe nonsense?â And
 24081	it was just this peculiarity of SperÃ¡nskiâs mind that particularly
 24082	attracted Prince Andrew.
 24083	
 24084	During the first period of their acquaintance BolkÃ³nski felt a
 24085	passionate admiration for him similar to that which he had once felt for
 24086	Bonaparte. The fact that SperÃ¡nski was the son of a village priest,
 24087	and that stupid people might meanly despise him on account of his
 24088	humble origin (as in fact many did), caused Prince Andrew to cherish his
 24089	sentiment for him the more, and unconsciously to strengthen it.
 24090	
 24091	On that first evening BolkÃ³nski spent with him, having mentioned the
 24092	Commission for the Revision of the Code of Laws, SperÃ¡nski told him
 24093	sarcastically that the Commission had existed for a hundred and fifty
 24094	years, had cost millions, and had done nothing except that Rosenkampf
 24095	had stuck labels on the corresponding paragraphs of the different codes.
 24096	
 24097	âAnd that is all the state has for the millions it has spent,â said
 24098	he. âWe want to give the Senate new juridical powers, but we have no
 24099	laws. That is why it is a sin for men like you, Prince, not to serve in
 24100	these times!â
 24101	
 24102	Prince Andrew said that for that work an education in jurisprudence was
 24103	needed which he did not possess.
 24104	
 24105	âBut nobody possesses it, so what would you have? It is a vicious
 24106	circle from which we must break a way out.â
 24107	
 24108	A week later Prince Andrew was a member of the Committee on Army
 24109	Regulations andâwhat he had not at all expectedâwas chairman of a
 24110	section of the committee for the revision of the laws. At SperÃ¡nskiâs
 24111	request he took the first part of the Civil Code that was being drawn up
 24112	and, with the aid of the Code NapolÃ©on and the Institutes of Justinian,
 24113	he worked at formulating the section on Personal Rights.

 24119	CHAPTER VII
 24120	
 24121	Nearly two years before this, in 1808, Pierre on returning to Petersburg
 24122	after visiting his estates had involuntarily found himself in a leading
 24123	position among the Petersburg Freemasons. He arranged dining and funeral
 24124	lodge meetings, enrolled new members, and busied himself uniting various
 24125	lodges and acquiring authentic charters. He gave money for the erection
 24126	of temples and supplemented as far as he could the collection of alms,
 24127	in regard to which the majority of members were stingy and irregular.
 24128	He supported almost singlehanded a poorhouse the order had founded in
 24129	Petersburg.
 24130	
 24131	His life meanwhile continued as before, with the same infatuations and
 24132	dissipations. He liked to dine and drink well, and though he considered
 24133	it immoral and humiliating could not resist the temptations of the
 24134	bachelor circles in which he moved.
 24135	
 24136	Amid the turmoil of his activities and distractions, however, Pierre at
 24137	the end of a year began to feel that the more firmly he tried to rest
 24138	upon it, the more Masonic ground on which he stood gave way under him.
 24139	At the same time he felt that the deeper the ground sank under him the
 24140	closer bound he involuntarily became to the order. When he had joined
 24141	the Freemasons he had experienced the feeling of one who confidently
 24142	steps onto the smooth surface of a bog. When he put his foot down it
 24143	sank in. To make quite sure of the firmness of the ground, he put
 24144	his other foot down and sank deeper still, became stuck in it, and
 24145	involuntarily waded knee-deep in the bog.
 24146	
 24147	Joseph AlexÃ©evich was not in Petersburgâhe had of late stood aside
 24148	from the affairs of the Petersburg lodges, and lived almost entirely in
 24149	Moscow. All the members of the lodges were men Pierre knew in ordinary
 24150	life, and it was difficult for him to regard them merely as Brothers in
 24151	Freemasonry and not as Prince B. or IvÃ¡n VasÃ­levich D., whom he knew
 24152	in society mostly as weak and insignificant men. Under the Masonic
 24153	aprons and insignia he saw the uniforms and decorations at which they
 24154	aimed in ordinary life. Often after collecting alms, and reckoning up
 24155	twenty to thirty rubles received for the most part in promises from a
 24156	dozen members, of whom half were as well able to pay as himself, Pierre
 24157	remembered the Masonic vow in which each Brother promised to devote
 24158	all his belongings to his neighbor, and doubts on which he tried not to
 24159	dwell arose in his soul.
 24160	
 24161	He divided the Brothers he knew into four categories. In the first he
 24162	put those who did not take an active part in the affairs of the lodges
 24163	or in human affairs, but were exclusively occupied with the mystical
 24164	science of the order: with questions of the threefold designation of
 24165	God, the three primordial elementsâsulphur, mercury, and saltâor
 24166	the meaning of the square and all the various figures of the temple of
 24167	Solomon. Pierre respected this class of Brothers to which the elder ones
 24168	chiefly belonged, including, Pierre thought, Joseph AlexÃ©evich himself,
 24169	but he did not share their interests. His heart was not in the mystical
 24170	aspect of Freemasonry.
 24171	
 24172	In the second category Pierre reckoned himself and others like him,
 24173	seeking and vacillating, who had not yet found in Freemasonry a straight
 24174	and comprehensible path, but hoped to do so.
 24175	
 24176	In the third category he included those Brothers (the majority) who saw
 24177	nothing in Freemasonry but the external forms and ceremonies, and prized
 24178	the strict performance of these forms without troubling about their
 24179	purport or significance. Such were Willarski and even the Grand Master
 24180	of the principal lodge.
 24181	
 24182	Finally, to the fourth category also a great many Brothers belonged,
 24183	particularly those who had lately joined. These according to Pierreâs
 24184	observations were men who had no belief in anything, nor desire for
 24185	anything, but joined the Freemasons merely to associate with the wealthy
 24186	young Brothers who were influential through their connections or rank,
 24187	and of whom there were very many in the lodge.
 24188	
 24189	Pierre began to feel dissatisfied with what he was doing. Freemasonry,
 24190	at any rate as he saw it here, sometimes seemed to him based merely
 24191	on externals. He did not think of doubting Freemasonry itself, but
 24192	suspected that Russian Masonry had taken a wrong path and deviated
 24193	from its original principles. And so toward the end of the year he went
 24194	abroad to be initiated into the higher secrets of the order.
 24195	
 24196	In the summer of 1809 Pierre returned to Petersburg. Our Freemasons knew
 24197	from correspondence with those abroad that BezÃºkhov had obtained the
 24198	confidence of many highly placed persons, had been initiated into many
 24199	mysteries, had been raised to a higher grade, and was bringing back with
 24200	him much that might conduce to the advantage of the Masonic cause
 24201	in Russia. The Petersburg Freemasons all came to see him, tried to
 24202	ingratiate themselves with him, and it seemed to them all that he was
 24203	preparing something for them and concealing it.
 24204	
 24205	A solemn meeting of the lodge of the second degree was convened, at
 24206	which Pierre promised to communicate to the Petersburg Brothers what
 24207	he had to deliver to them from the highest leaders of their order. The
 24208	meeting was a full one. After the usual ceremonies Pierre rose and began
 24209	his address.
 24210	
 24211	âDear Brothers,â he began, blushing and stammering, with a written
 24212	speech in his hand, âit is not sufficient to observe our mysteries in
 24213	the seclusion of our lodgeâwe must actâact! We are drowsing, but we
 24214	must act.â Pierre raised his notebook and began to read.
 24215	
 24216	âFor the dissemination of pure truth and to secure the triumph of
 24217	virtue,â he read, âwe must cleanse men from prejudice, diffuse
 24218	principles in harmony with the spirit of the times, undertake the
 24219	education of the young, unite ourselves in indissoluble bonds with the
 24220	wisest men, boldly yet prudently overcome superstitions, infidelity, and
 24221	folly, and form of those devoted to us a body linked together by unity
 24222	of purpose and possessed of authority and power.
 24223	
 24224	âTo attain this end we must secure a preponderance of virtue over vice
 24225	and must endeavor to secure that the honest man may, even in this world,
 24226	receive a lasting reward for his virtue. But in these great endeavors we
 24227	are gravely hampered by the political institutions of today. What is
 24228	to be done in these circumstances? To favor revolutions, overthrow
 24229	everything, repel force by force?... No! We are very far from that.
 24230	Every violent reform deserves censure, for it quite fails to remedy
 24231	evil while men remain what they are, and also because wisdom needs no
 24232	violence.
 24233	
 24234	âThe whole plan of our order should be based on the idea of
 24235	preparing men of firmness and virtue bound together by unity of
 24236	convictionâaiming at the punishment of vice and folly, and patronizing
 24237	talent and virtue: raising worthy men from the dust and attaching
 24238	them to our Brotherhood. Only then will our order have the power
 24239	unobtrusively to bind the hands of the protectors of disorder and to
 24240	control them without their being aware of it. In a word, we must found a
 24241	form of government holding universal sway, which should be diffused over
 24242	the whole world without destroying the bonds of citizenship, and beside
 24243	which all other governments can continue in their customary course and
 24244	do everything except what impedes the great aim of our order, which
 24245	is to obtain for virtue the victory over vice. This aim was that of
 24246	Christianity itself. It taught men to be wise and good and for their
 24247	own benefit to follow the example and instruction of the best and wisest
 24248	men.
 24249	
 24250	âAt that time, when everything was plunged in darkness, preaching
 24251	alone was of course sufficient. The novelty of Truth endowed her with
 24252	special strength, but now we need much more powerful methods. It is
 24253	now necessary that man, governed by his senses, should find in virtue
 24254	a charm palpable to those senses. It is impossible to eradicate the
 24255	passions; but we must strive to direct them to a noble aim, and it is
 24256	therefore necessary that everyone should be able to satisfy his passions
 24257	within the limits of virtue. Our order should provide means to that end.
 24258	
 24259	âAs soon as we have a certain number of worthy men in every state,
 24260	each of them again training two others and all being closely united,
 24261	everything will be possible for our order, which has already in secret
 24262	accomplished much for the welfare of mankind.â
 24263	
 24264	This speech not only made a strong impression, but created excitement in
 24265	the lodge. The majority of the Brothers, seeing in it dangerous designs
 24266	of Illuminism, * met it with a coldness that surprised Pierre. The Grand
 24267	Master began answering him, and Pierre began developing his views with
 24268	more and more warmth. It was long since there had been so stormy a
 24269	meeting. Parties were formed, some accusing Pierre of Illuminism, others
 24270	supporting him. At that meeting he was struck for the first time by
 24271	the endless variety of menâs minds, which prevents a truth from ever
 24272	presenting itself identically to two persons. Even those members
 24273	who seemed to be on his side understood him in their own way with
 24274	limitations and alterations he could not agree to, as what he always
 24275	wanted most was to convey his thought to others just as he himself
 24276	understood it.
 24277	
 24278	     * The Illuminati sought to substitute republican for
 24279	     monarchical institutions.
 24280	
 24281	At the end of the meeting the Grand Master with irony and ill-will
 24282	reproved BezÃºkhov for his vehemence and said it was not love of virtue
 24283	alone, but also a love of strife that had moved him in the dispute.
 24284	Pierre did not answer him and asked briefly whether his proposal would
 24285	be accepted. He was told that it would not, and without waiting for the
 24286	usual formalities he left the lodge and went home.
 24287	
 24288	
 24289	
 24290	
 24291	
 24292	CHAPTER VIII
 24293	
 24294	Again Pierre was overtaken by the depression he so dreaded. For three
 24295	days after the delivery of his speech at the lodge he lay on a sofa at
 24296	home receiving no one and going nowhere.
 24297	
 24298	It was just then that he received a letter from his wife, who implored
 24299	him to see her, telling him how grieved she was about him and how she
 24300	wished to devote her whole life to him.
 24301	
 24302	At the end of the letter she informed him that in a few days she would
 24303	return to Petersburg from abroad.
 24304	
 24305	Following this letter one of the Masonic Brothers whom Pierre respected
 24306	less than the others forced his way in to see him and, turning the
 24307	conversation upon Pierreâs matrimonial affairs, by way of fraternal
 24308	advice expressed the opinion that his severity to his wife was wrong
 24309	and that he was neglecting one of the first rules of Freemasonry by not
 24310	forgiving the penitent.
 24311	
 24312	At the same time his mother-in-law, Prince VasÃ­liâs wife, sent to
 24313	him imploring him to come if only for a few minutes to discuss a most
 24314	important matter. Pierre saw that there was a conspiracy against him and
 24315	that they wanted to reunite him with his wife, and in the mood he then
 24316	was, this was not even unpleasant to him. Nothing mattered to him.
 24317	Nothing in life seemed to him of much importance, and under the
 24318	influence of the depression that possessed him he valued neither his
 24319	liberty nor his resolution to punish his wife.
 24320	
 24321	âNo one is right and no one is to blame; so she too is not to
 24322	blame,â he thought.
 24323	
 24324	If he did not at once give his consent to a reunion with his wife, it
 24325	was only because in his state of depression he did not feel able to take
 24326	any step. Had his wife come to him, he would not have turned her away.
 24327	Compared to what preoccupied him, was it not a matter of indifference
 24328	whether he lived with his wife or not?
 24329	
 24330	Without replying either to his wife or his mother-in-law, Pierre late
 24331	one night prepared for a journey and started for Moscow to see Joseph
 24332	AlexÃ©evich. This is what he noted in his diary:
 24333	
 24334	Moscow, 17th November
 24335	
 24336	I have just returned from my benefactor, and hasten to write down what I
 24337	have experienced. Joseph AlexÃ©evich is living poorly and has for three
 24338	years been suffering from a painful disease of the bladder. No one has
 24339	ever heard him utter a groan or a word of complaint. From morning till
 24340	late at night, except when he eats his very plain food, he is working
 24341	at science. He received me graciously and made me sit down on the bed
 24342	on which he lay. I made the sign of the Knights of the East and of
 24343	Jerusalem, and he responded in the same manner, asking me with a mild
 24344	smile what I had learned and gained in the Prussian and Scottish lodges.
 24345	I told him everything as best I could, and told him what I had proposed
 24346	to our Petersburg lodge, of the bad reception I had encountered, and of
 24347	my rupture with the Brothers. Joseph AlexÃ©evich, having remained silent
 24348	and thoughtful for a good while, told me his view of the matter, which
 24349	at once lit up for me my whole past and the future path I should follow.
 24350	He surprised me by asking whether I remembered the threefold aim of
 24351	the order: (1) The preservation and study of the mystery. (2) The
 24352	purification and reformation of oneself for its reception, and (3) The
 24353	improvement of the human race by striving for such purification. Which
 24354	is the principal aim of these three? Certainly self-reformation and
 24355	self-purification. Only to this aim can we always strive independently
 24356	of circumstances. But at the same time just this aim demands the
 24357	greatest efforts of us; and so, led astray by pride, losing sight of
 24358	this aim, we occupy ourselves either with the mystery which in our
 24359	impurity we are unworthy to receive, or seek the reformation of
 24360	the human race while ourselves setting an example of baseness and
 24361	profligacy. Illuminism is not a pure doctrine, just because it is
 24362	attracted by social activity and puffed up by pride. On this ground
 24363	Joseph AlexÃ©evich condemned my speech and my whole activity, and in the
 24364	depth of my soul I agreed with him. Talking of my family affairs he said
 24365	to me, âthe chief duty of a true Mason, as I have told you, lies in
 24366	perfecting himself. We often think that by removing all the difficulties
 24367	of our life we shall more quickly reach our aim, but on the contrary,
 24368	my dear sir, it is only in the midst of worldly cares that we can attain
 24369	our three chief aims: (1) Self-knowledgeâfor man can only know himself
 24370	by comparison, (2) Self-perfecting, which can only be attained by
 24371	conflict, and (3) The attainment of the chief virtueâlove of death.
 24372	Only the vicissitudes of life can show us its vanity and develop our
 24373	innate love of death or of rebirth to a new life.â These words are all
 24374	the more remarkable because, in spite of his great physical sufferings,
 24375	Joseph AlexÃ©evich is never weary of life though he loves death, for
 24376	whichâin spite of the purity and loftiness of his inner manâhe does
 24377	not yet feel himself sufficiently prepared. My benefactor then explained
 24378	to me fully the meaning of the Great Square of creation and pointed out
 24379	to me that the numbers three and seven are the basis of everything. He
 24380	advised me not to avoid intercourse with the Petersburg Brothers, but
 24381	to take up only second-grade posts in the lodge, to try, while
 24382	diverting the Brothers from pride, to turn them toward the true path
 24383	self-knowledge and self-perfecting. Besides this he advised me for
 24384	myself personally above all to keep a watch over myself, and to that end
 24385	he gave me a notebook, the one I am now writing in and in which I will
 24386	in future note down all my actions.
 24387	
 24388	Petersburg, 23rd November
 24389	
 24390	I am again living with my wife. My mother-in-law came to me in tears and
 24391	said that HÃ©lÃ¨ne was here and that she implored me to hear her; that
 24392	she was innocent and unhappy at my desertion, and much more. I knew
 24393	that if I once let myself see her I should not have strength to go on
 24394	refusing what she wanted. In my perplexity I did not know whose aid and
 24395	advice to seek. Had my benefactor been here he would have told me what
 24396	to do. I went to my room and reread Joseph AlexÃ©evichâs letters and
 24397	recalled my conversations with him, and deduced from it all that I
 24398	ought not to refuse a supplicant, and ought to reach a helping hand to
 24399	everyoneâespecially to one so closely bound to meâand that I must
 24400	bear my cross. But if I forgive her for the sake of doing right, then
 24401	let union with her have only a spiritual aim. That is what I decided,
 24402	and what I wrote to Joseph AlexÃ©evich. I told my wife that I begged her
 24403	to forget the past, to forgive me whatever wrong I may have done her,
 24404	and that I had nothing to forgive. It gave me joy to tell her this. She
 24405	need not know how hard it was for me to see her again. I have settled on
 24406	the upper floor of this big house and am experiencing a happy feeling of
 24407	regeneration.

 24415	At that time, as always happens, the highest society that met at court
 24416	and at the grand balls was divided into several circles, each with its
 24417	own particular tone. The largest of these was the French circle of the
 24418	Napoleonic alliance, the circle of Count RumyÃ¡ntsev and Caulaincourt.
 24419	In this group HÃ©lÃ¨ne, as soon as she had settled in Petersburg with
 24420	her husband, took a very prominent place. She was visited by the members
 24421	of the French embassy and by many belonging to that circle and noted for
 24422	their intellect and polished manners.
 24423	
 24424	HÃ©lÃ¨ne had been at Erfurt during the famous meeting of the Emperors
 24425	and had brought from there these connections with the Napoleonic
 24426	notabilities. At Erfurt her success had been brilliant. Napoleon himself
 24427	had noticed her in the theater and said of her: âCâest un superbe
 24428	animal.â * Her success as a beautiful and elegant woman did not
 24429	surprise Pierre, for she had become even handsomer than before. What did
 24430	surprise him was that during these last two years his wife had succeeded
 24431	in gaining the reputation âdâ une femme charmante, aussi spirituelle
 24432	que belle.â *(2) The distinguished Prince de Ligne wrote her
 24433	eight-page letters. BilÃ­bin saved up his epigrams to produce them
 24434	in Countess BezÃºkhovaâs presence. To be received in the Countess
 24435	BezÃºkhovaâs salon was regarded as a diploma of intellect. Young men
 24436	read books before attending HÃ©lÃ¨neâs evenings, to have something to
 24437	say in her salon, and secretaries of the embassy, and even ambassadors,
 24438	confided diplomatic secrets to her, so that in a way HÃ©lÃ¨ne was a
 24439	power. Pierre, who knew she was very stupid, sometimes attended, with a
 24440	strange feeling of perplexity and fear, her evenings and dinner parties,
 24441	where politics, poetry, and philosophy were discussed. At these parties
 24442	his feelings were like those of a conjuror who always expects his trick
 24443	to be found out at any moment. But whether because stupidity was just
 24444	what was needed to run such a salon, or because those who were deceived
 24445	found pleasure in the deception, at any rate it remained unexposed and
 24446	HÃ©lÃ¨ne BezÃºkhovaâs reputation as a lovely and clever woman became
 24447	so firmly established that she could say the emptiest and stupidest
 24448	things and everybody would go into raptures over every word of hers
 24449	and look for a profound meaning in it of which she herself had no
 24450	conception.
 24451	
 24452	     * âThatâs a superb animal.â
 24453	
 24454	     * (2) âOf a charming woman, as witty as she is lovely.â
 24455	
 24456	
 24457	Pierre was just the husband needed for a brilliant society woman. He was
 24458	that absent-minded crank, a grand seigneur husband who was in no oneâs
 24459	way, and far from spoiling the high tone and general impression of the
 24460	drawing room, he served, by the contrast he presented to her, as an
 24461	advantageous background to his elegant and tactful wife. Pierre during
 24462	the last two years, as a result of his continual absorption in abstract
 24463	interests and his sincere contempt for all else, had acquired in his
 24464	wifeâs circle, which did not interest him, that air of unconcern,
 24465	indifference, and benevolence toward all, which cannot be acquired
 24466	artificially and therefore inspires involuntary respect. He entered
 24467	his wifeâs drawing room as one enters a theater, was acquainted with
 24468	everybody, equally pleased to see everyone, and equally indifferent to
 24469	them all. Sometimes he joined in a conversation which interested him
 24470	and, regardless of whether any âgentlemen of the embassyâ were
 24471	present or not, lispingly expressed his views, which were sometimes not
 24472	at all in accord with the accepted tone of the moment. But the general
 24473	opinion concerning the queer husband of âthe most distinguished woman
 24474	in Petersburgâ was so well established that no one took his freaks
 24475	seriously.
 24476	
 24477	Among the many young men who frequented her house every day, BorÃ­s
 24478	DrubetskÃ³y, who had already achieved great success in the service, was
 24479	the most intimate friend of the BezÃºkhov household since HÃ©lÃ¨neâs
 24480	return from Erfurt. HÃ©lÃ¨ne spoke of him as âmon pageâ and treated
 24481	him like a child. Her smile for him was the same as for everybody,
 24482	but sometimes that smile made Pierre uncomfortable. Toward him BorÃ­s
 24483	behaved with a particularly dignified and sad deference. This shade
 24484	of deference also disturbed Pierre. He had suffered so painfully three
 24485	years before from the mortification to which his wife had subjected him
 24486	that he now protected himself from the danger of its repetition, first
 24487	by not being a husband to his wife, and secondly by not allowing himself
 24488	to suspect.
 24489	
 24490	âNo, now that she has become a bluestocking she has finally renounced
 24491	her former infatuations,â he told himself. âThere has never been
 24492	an instance of a bluestocking being carried away by affairs of the
 24493	heartââa statement which, though gathered from an unknown source,
 24494	he believed implicitly. Yet strange to say BorÃ­sâ presence in his
 24495	wifeâs drawing room (and he was almost always there) had a physical
 24496	effect upon Pierre; it constricted his limbs and destroyed the
 24497	unconsciousness and freedom of his movements.
 24498	
 24499	âWhat a strange antipathy,â thought Pierre, âyet I used to like
 24500	him very much.â
 24501	
 24502	In the eyes of the world Pierre was a great gentleman, the rather blind
 24503	and absurd husband of a distinguished wife, a clever crank who did
 24504	nothing but harmed nobody and was a first-rate, good-natured fellow. But
 24505	a complex and difficult process of internal development was taking place
 24506	all this time in Pierreâs soul, revealing much to him and causing him
 24507	many spiritual doubts and joys.
 24508

 24513	CHAPTER X
 24514	
 24515	Pierre went on with his diary, and this is what he wrote in it during
 24516	that time:
 24517	
 24518	
 24519	24th November
 24520	
 24521	Got up at eight, read the Scriptures, then went to my duties. (By Joseph
 24522	AlexÃ©evichâs advice Pierre had entered the service of the state and
 24523	served on one of the committees.) Returned home for dinner and dined
 24524	aloneâthe countess had many visitors I do not like. I ate and drank
 24525	moderately and after dinner copied out some passages for the Brothers.
 24526	In the evening I went down to the countess and told a funny story about
 24527	B., and only remembered that I ought not to have done so when everybody
 24528	laughed loudly at it.
 24529	
 24530	I am going to bed with a happy and tranquil mind. Great God, help me to
 24531	walk in Thy paths, (1) to conquer anger by calmness and deliberation,
 24532	(2) to vanquish lust by self-restraint and repulsion, (3) to withdraw
 24533	from worldliness, but not avoid (a) the service of the state, (b) family
 24534	duties, (c) relations with my friends, and the management of my affairs.
 24535	
 24536	
 24537	27th November
 24538	
 24539	I got up late. On waking I lay long in bed yielding to sloth. O God,
 24540	help and strengthen me that I may walk in Thy ways! Read the Scriptures,
 24541	but without proper feeling. Brother UrÃºsov came and we talked about
 24542	worldly vanities. He told me of the Emperorâs new projects. I began
 24543	to criticize them, but remembered my rules and my benefactorâs
 24544	wordsâthat a true Freemason should be a zealous worker for the state
 24545	when his aid is required and a quiet onlooker when not called on to
 24546	assist. My tongue is my enemy. Brothers G. V. and O. visited me and we
 24547	had a preliminary talk about the reception of a new Brother. They laid
 24548	on me the duty of Rhetor. I feel myself weak and unworthy. Then our
 24549	talk turned to the interpretation of the seven pillars and steps of the
 24550	Temple, the seven sciences, the seven virtues, the seven vices, and the
 24551	seven gifts of the Holy Spirit. Brother O. was very eloquent. In the
 24552	evening the admission took place. The new decoration of the Premises
 24553	contributed much to the magnificence of the spectacle. It was BorÃ­s
 24554	DrubetskÃ³y who was admitted. I nominated him and was the Rhetor. A
 24555	strange feeling agitated me all the time I was alone with him in the
 24556	dark chamber. I caught myself harboring a feeling of hatred toward him
 24557	which I vainly tried to overcome. That is why I should really like
 24558	to save him from evil and lead him into the path of truth, but evil
 24559	thoughts of him did not leave me. It seemed to me that his object in
 24560	entering the Brotherhood was merely to be intimate and in favor with
 24561	members of our lodge. Apart from the fact that he had asked me several
 24562	times whether N. and S. were members of our lodge (a question to which I
 24563	could not reply) and that according to my observation he is incapable of
 24564	feeling respect for our holy order and is too preoccupied and satisfied
 24565	with the outer man to desire spiritual improvement, I had no cause to
 24566	doubt him, but he seemed to me insincere, and all the time I stood
 24567	alone with him in the dark temple it seemed to me that he was smiling
 24568	contemptuously at my words, and I wished really to stab his bare breast
 24569	with the sword I held to it. I could not be eloquent, nor could I
 24570	frankly mention my doubts to the Brothers and to the Grand Master. Great
 24571	Architect of Nature, help me to find the true path out of the labyrinth
 24572	of lies!
 24573	
 24574	
 24575	After this, three pages were left blank in the diary, and then the
 24576	following was written:
 24577	
 24578	
 24579	I have had a long and instructive talk alone with Brother V., who
 24580	advised me to hold fast by Brother A. Though I am unworthy, much was
 24581	revealed to me. Adonai is the name of the creator of the world. Elohim
 24582	is the name of the ruler of all. The third name is the name unutterable
 24583	which means the All. Talks with Brother V. strengthen, refresh, and
 24584	support me in the path of virtue. In his presence doubt has no place.
 24585	The distinction between the poor teachings of mundane science and our
 24586	sacred all-embracing teaching is clear to me. Human sciences dissect
 24587	everything to comprehend it, and kill everything to examine it. In the
 24588	holy science of our order all is one, all is known in its entirety and
 24589	life. The Trinityâthe three elements of matterâare sulphur, mercury,
 24590	and salt. Sulphur is of an oily and fiery nature; in combination with
 24591	salt by its fiery nature it arouses a desire in the latter by means
 24592	of which it attracts mercury, seizes it, holds it, and in combination
 24593	produces other bodies. Mercury is a fluid, volatile, spiritual essence.
 24594	Christ, the Holy Spirit, Him!...
 24595	
 24596	
 24597	3rd December
 24598	
 24599	Awoke late, read the Scriptures but was apathetic. Afterwards went and
 24600	paced up and down the large hall. I wished to meditate, but instead my
 24601	imagination pictured an occurrence of four years ago, when DÃ³lokhov,
 24602	meeting me in Moscow after our duel, said he hoped I was enjoying
 24603	perfect peace of mind in spite of my wifeâs absence. At the time I
 24604	gave him no answer. Now I recalled every detail of that meeting and in
 24605	my mind gave him the most malevolent and bitter replies. I recollected
 24606	myself and drove away that thought only when I found myself glowing with
 24607	anger, but I did not sufficiently repent. Afterwards BorÃ­s DrubetskÃ³y
 24608	came and began relating various adventures. His coming vexed me from the
 24609	first, and I said something disagreeable to him. He replied. I flared
 24610	up and said much that was unpleasant and even rude to him. He became
 24611	silent, and I recollected myself only when it was too late. My God, I
 24612	cannot get on with him at all. The cause of this is my egotism. I set
 24613	myself above him and so become much worse than he, for he is lenient
 24614	to my rudeness while I on the contrary nourish contempt for him. O God,
 24615	grant that in his presence I may rather see my own vileness, and behave
 24616	so that he too may benefit. After dinner I fell asleep and as I was
 24617	drowsing off I clearly heard a voice saying in my left ear, âThy
 24618	day!â
 24619	
 24620	I dreamed that I was walking in the dark and was suddenly surrounded by
 24621	dogs, but I went on undismayed. Suddenly a smallish dog seized my left
 24622	thigh with its teeth and would not let go. I began to throttle it with
 24623	my hands. Scarcely had I torn it off before another, a bigger one, began
 24624	biting me. I lifted it up, but the higher I lifted it the bigger and
 24625	heavier it grew. And suddenly Brother A. came and, taking my arm, led
 24626	me to a building to enter which we had to pass along a narrow plank.
 24627	I stepped on it, but it bent and gave way and I began to clamber up a
 24628	fence which I could scarcely reach with my hands. After much effort I
 24629	dragged myself up, so that my leg hung down on one side and my body on
 24630	the other. I looked round and saw Brother A. standing on the fence and
 24631	pointing me to a broad avenue and garden, and in the garden was a large
 24632	and beautiful building. I woke up. O Lord, great Architect of Nature,
 24633	help me to tear from myself these dogsâmy passions especially the
 24634	last, which unites in itself the strength of all the former ones, and
 24635	aid me to enter that temple of virtue to a vision of which I attained in
 24636	my dream.
 24637	
 24638	
 24639	7th December
 24640	
 24641	I dreamed that Joseph AlexÃ©evich was sitting in my house, and that I
 24642	was very glad and wished to entertain him. It seemed as if I chattered
 24643	incessantly with other people and suddenly remembered that this could
 24644	not please him, and I wished to come close to him and embrace him. But
 24645	as soon as I drew near I saw that his face had changed and grown young,
 24646	and he was quietly telling me something about the teaching of our order,
 24647	but so softly that I could not hear it. Then it seemed that we all left
 24648	the room and something strange happened. We were sitting or lying on
 24649	the floor. He was telling me something, and I wished to show him my
 24650	sensibility, and not listening to what he was saying I began picturing
 24651	to myself the condition of my inner man and the grace of God sanctifying
 24652	me. And tears came into my eyes, and I was glad he noticed this. But he
 24653	looked at me with vexation and jumped up, breaking off his remarks. I
 24654	felt abashed and asked whether what he had been saying did not concern
 24655	me; but he did not reply, gave me a kind look, and then we suddenly
 24656	found ourselves in my bedroom where there is a double bed. He lay down
 24657	on the edge of it and I burned with longing to caress him and lie down
 24658	too. And he said, âTell me frankly what is your chief temptation? Do
 24659	you know it? I think you know it already.â Abashed by this question,
 24660	I replied that sloth was my chief temptation. He shook his head
 24661	incredulously; and even more abashed, I said that though I was living
 24662	with my wife as he advised, I was not living with her as her husband. To
 24663	this he replied that one should not deprive a wife of oneâs embraces
 24664	and gave me to understand that that was my duty. But I replied that
 24665	I should be ashamed to do it, and suddenly everything vanished. And I
 24666	awoke and found in my mind the text from the Gospel: âThe life was
 24667	the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness
 24668	comprehended it not.â Joseph AlexÃ©evichâs face had looked young
 24669	and bright. That day I received a letter from my benefactor in which he
 24670	wrote about âconjugal duties.â
 24671	
 24672	
 24673	9th December
 24674	
 24675	I had a dream from which I awoke with a throbbing heart. I saw that
 24676	I was in Moscow in my house, in the big sitting room, and Joseph
 24677	AlexÃ©evich came in from the drawing room. I seemed to know at once that
 24678	the process of regeneration had already taken place in him, and I rushed
 24679	to meet him. I embraced him and kissed his hands, and he said, âHast
 24680	thou noticed that my face is different?â I looked at him, still
 24681	holding him in my arms, and saw that his face was young, but that he
 24682	had no hair on his head and his features were quite changed. And I said,
 24683	âI should have known you had I met you by chance,â and I thought to
 24684	myself, âAm I telling the truth?â And suddenly I saw him lying like
 24685	a dead body; then he gradually recovered and went with me into my study
 24686	carrying a large book of sheets of drawing paper; I said, âI drew
 24687	that,â and he answered by bowing his head. I opened the book, and on
 24688	all the pages there were excellent drawings. And in my dream I knew
 24689	that these drawings represented the love adventures of the soul with its
 24690	beloved. And on its pages I saw a beautiful representation of a maiden
 24691	in transparent garments and with a transparent body, flying up to the
 24692	clouds. And I seemed to know that this maiden was nothing else than a
 24693	representation of the Song of Songs. And looking at those drawings I
 24694	dreamed I felt that I was doing wrong, but could not tear myself away
 24695	from them. Lord, help me! My God, if Thy forsaking me is Thy doing, Thy
 24696	will be done; but if I am myself the cause, teach me what I should do! I
 24697	shall perish of my debauchery if Thou utterly desertest me!
 24698	
 24699	
 24700	
 24701	
 24702	
 24703	CHAPTER XI
 24704	
 24705	The RostÃ³vsâ monetary affairs had not improved during the two years
 24706	they had spent in the country.
 24707	
 24708	Though Nicholas RostÃ³v had kept firmly to his resolution and was still
 24709	serving modestly in an obscure regiment, spending comparatively little,
 24710	the way of life at OtrÃ¡dnoeâMÃ­tenkaâs management of affairs, in
 24711	particularâwas such that the debts inevitably increased every year.
 24712	The only resource obviously presenting itself to the old count was to
 24713	apply for an official post, so he had come to Petersburg to look for one
 24714	and also, as he said, to let the lassies enjoy themselves for the last
 24715	time.
 24716	
 24717	Soon after their arrival in Petersburg Berg proposed to VÃ©ra and was
 24718	accepted.
 24719	
 24720	Though in Moscow the RostÃ³vs belonged to the best society without
 24721	themselves giving it a thought, yet in Petersburg their circle of
 24722	acquaintances was a mixed and indefinite one. In Petersburg they were
 24723	provincials, and the very people they had entertained in Moscow without
 24724	inquiring to what set they belonged, here looked down on them.
 24725	
 24726	The RostÃ³vs lived in the same hospitable way in Petersburg as in
 24727	Moscow, and the most diverse people met at their suppers. Country
 24728	neighbors from OtrÃ¡dnoe, impoverished old squires and their daughters,
 24729	PerÃ³nskaya a maid of honor, Pierre BezÃºkhov, and the son of their
 24730	district postmaster who had obtained a post in Petersburg. Among the
 24731	men who very soon became frequent visitors at the RostÃ³vsâ house in
 24732	Petersburg were BorÃ­s, Pierre whom the count had met in the street and
 24733	dragged home with him, and Berg who spent whole days at the RostÃ³vsâ
 24734	and paid the eldest daughter, Countess VÃ©ra, the attentions a young man
 24735	pays when he intends to propose.
 24736	
 24737	Not in vain had Berg shown everybody his right hand wounded at
 24738	Austerlitz and held a perfectly unnecessary sword in his left. He
 24739	narrated that episode so persistently and with so important an air that
 24740	everyone believed in the merit and usefulness of his deed, and he had
 24741	obtained two decorations for Austerlitz.
 24742	
 24743	In the Finnish war he also managed to distinguish himself. He had picked
 24744	up the scrap of a grenade that had killed an aide-de-camp standing near
 24745	the commander in chief and had taken it to his commander. Just as he had
 24746	done after Austerlitz, he related this occurrence at such length and
 24747	so insistently that everyone again believed it had been necessary to do
 24748	this, and he received two decorations for the Finnish war also. In
 24749	1809 he was a captain in the Guards, wore medals, and held some special
 24750	lucrative posts in Petersburg.
 24751	
 24752	Though some skeptics smiled when told of Bergâs merits, it could not
 24753	be denied that he was a painstaking and brave officer, on excellent
 24754	terms with his superiors, and a moral young man with a brilliant career
 24755	before him and an assured position in society.
 24756	
 24757	Four years before, meeting a German comrade in the stalls of a Moscow
 24758	theater, Berg had pointed out VÃ©ra RostÃ³va to him and had said in
 24759	German, âdas soll mein Weib werden,â * and from that moment had
 24760	made up his mind to marry her. Now in Petersburg, having considered the
 24761	RostÃ³vsâ position and his own, he decided that the time had come to
 24762	propose.
 24763	
 24764	    * âThat girl shall be my wife.â
 24765	
 24766	
 24767	Bergâs proposal was at first received with a perplexity that was not
 24768	flattering to him. At first it seemed strange that the son of an obscure
 24769	Livonian gentleman should propose marriage to a Countess RostÃ³va; but
 24770	Bergâs chief characteristic was such a naÃ¯ve and good natured egotism
 24771	that the RostÃ³vs involuntarily came to think it would be a good thing,
 24772	since he himself was so firmly convinced that it was good, indeed
 24773	excellent. Moreover, the RostÃ³vsâ affairs were seriously embarrassed,
 24774	as the suitor could not but know; and above all, VÃ©ra was twenty-four,
 24775	had been taken out everywhere, and though she was certainly good-looking
 24776	and sensible, no one up to now had proposed to her. So they gave their
 24777	consent.
 24778	
 24779	âYou see,â said Berg to his comrade, whom he called âfriendâ
 24780	only because he knew that everyone has friends, âyou see, I have
 24781	considered it all, and should not marry if I had not thought it all out
 24782	or if it were in any way unsuitable. But on the contrary, my papa and
 24783	mamma are now provided forâI have arranged that rent for them in the
 24784	Baltic Provincesâand I can live in Petersburg on my pay, and with
 24785	her fortune and my good management we can get along nicely. I am not
 24786	marrying for moneyâI consider that dishonorableâbut a wife should
 24787	bring her share and a husband his. I have my position in the service,
 24788	she has connections and some means. In our times that is worth
 24789	something, isnât it? But above all, she is a handsome, estimable girl,
 24790	and she loves me....â
 24791	
 24792	Berg blushed and smiled.
 24793	
 24794	âAnd I love her, because her character is sensible and very good.
 24795	Now the other sister, though they are the same family, is quite
 24796	differentâan unpleasant character and has not the same intelligence.
 24797	She is so... you know?... Unpleasant... But my fiancÃ©e!... Well, you
 24798	will be coming,â he was going to say, âto dine,â but changed his
 24799	mind and said âto take tea with us,â and quickly doubling up his
 24800	tongue he blew a small round ring of tobacco smoke, perfectly embodying
 24801	his dream of happiness.
 24802	
 24803	After the first feeling of perplexity aroused in the parents by Bergâs
 24804	proposal, the holiday tone of joyousness usual at such times took
 24805	possession of the family, but the rejoicing was external and insincere.
 24806	In the familyâs feeling toward this wedding a certain awkwardness
 24807	and constraint was evident, as if they were ashamed of not having loved
 24808	VÃ©ra sufficiently and of being so ready to get her off their hands. The
 24809	old count felt this most. He would probably have been unable to state
 24810	the cause of his embarrassment, but it resulted from the state of his
 24811	affairs. He did not know at all how much he had, what his debts amounted
 24812	to, or what dowry he could give VÃ©ra. When his daughters were born
 24813	he had assigned to each of them, for her dowry, an estate with three
 24814	hundred serfs; but one of these estates had already been sold, and the
 24815	other was mortgaged and the interest so much in arrears that it would
 24816	have to be sold, so that it was impossible to give it to VÃ©ra. Nor had
 24817	he any money.
 24818	
 24819	Berg had already been engaged a month, and only a week remained before
 24820	the wedding, but the count had not yet decided in his own mind the
 24821	question of the dowry, nor spoken to his wife about it. At one time the
 24822	count thought of giving her the RyazÃ¡n estate or of selling a forest,
 24823	at another time of borrowing money on a note of hand. A few days before
 24824	the wedding Berg entered the countâs study early one morning and, with
 24825	a pleasant smile, respectfully asked his future father-in-law to let
 24826	him know what VÃ©raâs dowry would be. The count was so disconcerted by
 24827	this long-foreseen inquiry that without consideration he gave the first
 24828	reply that came into his head. âI like your being businesslike about
 24829	it.... I like it. You shall be satisfied....â
 24830	
 24831	And patting Berg on the shoulder he got up, wishing to end the
 24832	conversation. But Berg, smiling pleasantly, explained that if he did not
 24833	know for certain how much VÃ©ra would have and did not receive at least
 24834	part of the dowry in advance, he would have to break matters off.
 24835	
 24836	âBecause, consider, Countâif I allowed myself to marry now
 24837	without having definite means to maintain my wife, I should be acting
 24838	badly....â
 24839	
 24840	The conversation ended by the count, who wished to be generous and to
 24841	avoid further importunity, saying that he would give a note of hand
 24842	for eighty thousand rubles. Berg smiled meekly, kissed the count on the
 24843	shoulder, and said that he was very grateful, but that it was impossible
 24844	for him to arrange his new life without receiving thirty thousand in
 24845	ready money. âOr at least twenty thousand, Count,â he added, âand
 24846	then a note of hand for only sixty thousand.â
 24847	
 24848	âYes, yes, all right!â said the count hurriedly. âOnly excuse me,
 24849	my dear fellow, Iâll give you twenty thousand and a note of hand for
 24850	eighty thousand as well. Yes, yes! Kiss me.â
 24851	
 24852	
 24853	
 24854	
 24855	
 24856	CHAPTER XII
 24857	
 24858	NatÃ¡sha was sixteen and it was the year 1809, the very year to which
 24859	she had counted on her fingers with BorÃ­s after they had kissed four
 24860	years ago. Since then she had not seen him. Before SÃ³nya and her
 24861	mother, if BorÃ­s happened to be mentioned, she spoke quite freely of
 24862	that episode as of some childish, long-forgotten matter that was not
 24863	worth mentioning. But in the secret depths of her soul the question
 24864	whether her engagement to BorÃ­s was a jest or an important, binding
 24865	promise tormented her.
 24866	
 24867	Since BorÃ­s left Moscow in 1805 to join the army he had not seen the
 24868	RostÃ³vs. He had been in Moscow several times, and had passed near
 24869	OtrÃ¡dnoe, but had never been to see them.
 24870	
 24871	Sometimes it occurred to NatÃ¡sha that he did not wish to see her, and
 24872	this conjecture was confirmed by the sad tone in which her elders spoke
 24873	of him.
 24874	
 24875	âNowadays old friends are not remembered,â the countess would say
 24876	when BorÃ­s was mentioned.
 24877	
 24878	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna also had of late visited them less frequently, seemed
 24879	to hold herself with particular dignity, and always spoke rapturously
 24880	and gratefully of the merits of her son and the brilliant career on
 24881	which he had entered. When the RostÃ³vs came to Petersburg BorÃ­s called
 24882	on them.
 24883	
 24884	He drove to their house in some agitation. The memory of NatÃ¡sha was
 24885	his most poetic recollection. But he went with the firm intention of
 24886	letting her and her parents feel that the childish relations between
 24887	himself and NatÃ¡sha could not be binding either on her or on him. He
 24888	had a brilliant position in society thanks to his intimacy with Countess
 24889	BezÃºkhova, a brilliant position in the service thanks to the patronage
 24890	of an important personage whose complete confidence he enjoyed, and he
 24891	was beginning to make plans for marrying one of the richest heiresses in
 24892	Petersburg, plans which might very easily be realized. When he entered
 24893	the RostÃ³vsâ drawing room NatÃ¡sha was in her own room. When she
 24894	heard of his arrival she almost ran into the drawing room, flushed and
 24895	beaming with a more than cordial smile.
 24896	
 24897	BorÃ­s remembered NatÃ¡sha in a short dress, with dark eyes shining from
 24898	under her curls and boisterous, childish laughter, as he had known her
 24899	four years before; and so he was taken aback when quite a different
 24900	NatÃ¡sha entered, and his face expressed rapturous astonishment. This
 24901	expression on his face pleased NatÃ¡sha.
 24902	
 24903	âWell, do you recognize your little madcap playmate?â asked the
 24904	countess.
 24905	
 24906	BorÃ­s kissed NatÃ¡shaâs hand and said that he was astonished at the
 24907	change in her.
 24908	
 24909	âHow handsome you have grown!â
 24910	
 24911	âI should think so!â replied NatÃ¡shaâs laughing eyes.
 24912	
 24913	âAnd is Papa older?â she asked.
 24914	
 24915	NatÃ¡sha sat down and, without joining in BorÃ­sâ conversation with
 24916	the countess, silently and minutely studied her childhoodâs suitor. He
 24917	felt the weight of that resolute and affectionate scrutiny and glanced
 24918	at her occasionally.
 24919	
 24920	BorÃ­sâ uniform, spurs, tie, and the way his hair was brushed were all
 24921	comme il faut and in the latest fashion. This NatÃ¡sha noticed at once.
 24922	He sat rather sideways in the armchair next to the countess, arranging
 24923	with his right hand the cleanest of gloves that fitted his left hand
 24924	like a skin, and he spoke with a particularly refined compression of his
 24925	lips about the amusements of the highest Petersburg society, recalling
 24926	with mild irony old times in Moscow and Moscow acquaintances. It was
 24927	not accidentally, NatÃ¡sha felt, that he alluded, when speaking of the
 24928	highest aristocracy, to an ambassadorâs ball he had attended, and to
 24929	invitations he had received from N.N. and S.S.
 24930	
 24931	All this time NatÃ¡sha sat silent, glancing up at him from under her
 24932	brows. This gaze disturbed and confused BorÃ­s more and more. He looked
 24933	round more frequently toward her, and broke off in what he was saying.
 24934	He did not stay more than ten minutes, then rose and took his leave. The
 24935	same inquisitive, challenging, and rather mocking eyes still looked
 24936	at him. After his first visit BorÃ­s said to himself that NatÃ¡sha
 24937	attracted him just as much as ever, but that he must not yield to that
 24938	feeling, because to marry her, a girl almost without fortune, would
 24939	mean ruin to his career, while to renew their former relations without
 24940	intending to marry her would be dishonorable. BorÃ­s made up his mind
 24941	to avoid meeting NatÃ¡sha, but despite that resolution he called again
 24942	a few days later and began calling often and spending whole days at the
 24943	RostÃ³vsâ. It seemed to him that he ought to have an explanation with
 24944	NatÃ¡sha and tell her that the old times must be forgotten, that in
 24945	spite of everything... she could not be his wife, that he had no means,
 24946	and they would never let her marry him. But he failed to do so and felt
 24947	awkward about entering on such an explanation. From day to day he
 24948	became more and more entangled. It seemed to her mother and SÃ³nya that
 24949	NatÃ¡sha was in love with BorÃ­s as of old. She sang him his favorite
 24950	songs, showed him her album, making him write in it, did not allow him
 24951	to allude to the past, letting it be understood how delightful was the
 24952	present; and every day he went away in a fog, without having said what
 24953	he meant to, and not knowing what he was doing or why he came, or how
 24954	it would all end. He left off visiting HÃ©lÃ¨ne and received reproachful
 24955	notes from her every day, and yet he continued to spend whole days with
 24956	the RostÃ³vs.
 24957	
 24958	
 24959	
 24960	
 24961	
 24962	CHAPTER XIII
 24963	
 24964	One night when the old countess, in nightcap and dressing jacket,
 24965	without her false curls, and with her poor little knob of hair showing
 24966	under her white cotton cap, knelt sighing and groaning on a rug and
 24967	bowing to the ground in prayer, her door creaked and NatÃ¡sha, also in
 24968	a dressing jacket with slippers on her bare feet and her hair in
 24969	curlpapers, ran in. The countessâher prayerful mood dispelledâlooked
 24970	round and frowned. She was finishing her last prayer: âCan it be that
 24971	this couch will be my grave?â NatÃ¡sha, flushed and eager, seeing
 24972	her mother in prayer, suddenly checked her rush, half sat down, and
 24973	unconsciously put out her tongue as if chiding herself. Seeing that
 24974	her mother was still praying she ran on tiptoe to the bed and, rapidly
 24975	slipping one little foot against the other, pushed off her slippers and
 24976	jumped onto the bed the countess had feared might become her grave. This
 24977	couch was high, with a feather bed and five pillows each smaller than
 24978	the one below. NatÃ¡sha jumped on it, sank into the feather bed, rolled
 24979	over to the wall, and began snuggling up the bedclothes as she settled
 24980	down, raising her knees to her chin, kicking out and laughing almost
 24981	inaudibly, now covering herself up head and all, and now peeping at her
 24982	mother. The countess finished her prayers and came to the bed with a
 24983	stern face, but seeing, that NatÃ¡shaâs head was covered, she smiled
 24984	in her kind, weak way.
 24985	
 24986	âNow then, now then!â said she.
 24987	
 24988	âMamma, can we have a talk? Yes?â said NatÃ¡sha. âNow, just one on
 24989	your throat and another... thatâll do!â And seizing her mother round
 24990	the neck, she kissed her on the throat. In her behavior to her mother
 24991	NatÃ¡sha seemed rough, but she was so sensitive and tactful that however
 24992	she clasped her mother she always managed to do it without hurting her
 24993	or making her feel uncomfortable or displeased.
 24994	
 24995	âWell, what is it tonight?â said the mother, having arranged her
 24996	pillows and waited until NatÃ¡sha, after turning over a couple of times,
 24997	had settled down beside her under the quilt, spread out her arms, and
 24998	assumed a serious expression.
 24999	
 25000	These visits of NatÃ¡shaâs at night before the count returned from his
 25001	club were one of the greatest pleasures of both mother, and daughter.
 25002	
 25003	âWhat is it tonight?âBut I have to tell you...â
 25004	
 25005	NatÃ¡sha put her hand on her motherâs mouth.
 25006	
 25007	âAbout BorÃ­s... I know,â she said seriously; âthatâs what I
 25008	have come about. Donât say itâI know. No, do tell me!â and she
 25009	removed her hand. âTell me, Mamma! Heâs nice?â
 25010	
 25011	âNatÃ¡sha, you are sixteen. At your age I was married. You say BorÃ­s
 25012	is nice. He is very nice, and I love him like a son. But what then?...
 25013	What are you thinking about? You have quite turned his head, I can see
 25014	that....â
 25015	
 25016	As she said this the countess looked round at her daughter. NatÃ¡sha
 25017	was lying looking steadily straight before her at one of the mahogany
 25018	sphinxes carved on the corners of the bedstead, so that the countess
 25019	only saw her daughterâs face in profile. That face struck her by its
 25020	peculiarly serious and concentrated expression.
 25021	
 25022	NatÃ¡sha was listening and considering.
 25023	
 25024	âWell, what then?â said she.
 25025	
 25026	âYou have quite turned his head, and why? What do you want of him? You
 25027	know you canât marry him.â
 25028	
 25029	âWhy not?â said NatÃ¡sha, without changing her position.
 25030	
 25031	âBecause he is young, because he is poor, because he is a relation...
 25032	and because you yourself donât love him.â
 25033	
 25034	âHow do you know?â
 25035	
 25036	âI know. It is not right, darling!â
 25037	
 25038	âBut if I want to...â said NatÃ¡sha.
 25039	
 25040	âLeave off talking nonsense,â said the countess.
 25041	
 25042	âBut if I want to...â
 25043	
 25044	âNatÃ¡sha, I am in earnest...â
 25045	
 25046	NatÃ¡sha did not let her finish. She drew the countessâ large hand to
 25047	her, kissed it on the back and then on the palm, then again turned it
 25048	over and began kissing first one knuckle, then the space between the
 25049	knuckles, then the next knuckle, whispering, âJanuary, February,
 25050	March, April, May. Speak, Mamma, why donât you say anything? Speak!â
 25051	said she, turning to her mother, who was tenderly gazing at her daughter
 25052	and in that contemplation seemed to have forgotten all she had wished to
 25053	say.
 25054	
 25055	âIt wonât do, my love! Not everyone will understand this friendship
 25056	dating from your childish days, and to see him so intimate with you may
 25057	injure you in the eyes of other young men who visit us, and above all
 25058	it torments him for nothing. He may already have found a suitable and
 25059	wealthy match, and now heâs half crazy.â
 25060	
 25061	âCrazy?â repeated NatÃ¡sha.
 25062	
 25063	âIâll tell you some things about myself. I had a cousin...â
 25064	
 25065	âI know! Cyril MatvÃ©ich... but he is old.â
 25066	
 25067	âHe was not always old. But this is what Iâll do, NatÃ¡sha, Iâll
 25068	have a talk with BorÃ­s. He need not come so often....â
 25069	
 25070	âWhy not, if he likes to?â
 25071	
 25072	âBecause I know it will end in nothing....â
 25073	
 25074	âHow can you know? No, Mamma, donât speak to him! What nonsense!â
 25075	said NatÃ¡sha in the tone of one being deprived of her property.
 25076	âWell, I wonât marry, but let him come if he enjoys it and I enjoy
 25077	it.â NatÃ¡sha smiled and looked at her mother. âNot to marry, but
 25078	just so,â she added.
 25079	
 25080	âHow so, my pet?â
 25081	
 25082	âJust so. Thereâs no need for me to marry him. But... just so.â
 25083	
 25084	âJust so, just so,â repeated the countess, and shaking all over, she
 25085	went off into a good humored, unexpected, elderly laugh.
 25086	
 25087	âDonât laugh, stop!â cried NatÃ¡sha. âYouâre shaking the whole
 25088	bed! Youâre awfully like me, just such another giggler.... Wait...â
 25089	and she seized the countessâ hands and kissed a knuckle of the little
 25090	finger, saying, âJune,â and continued, kissing, âJuly, August,â
 25091	on the other hand. âBut, Mamma, is he very much in love? What do you
 25092	think? Was anybody ever so much in love with you? And heâs very nice,
 25093	very, very nice. Only not quite my tasteâhe is so narrow, like the
 25094	dining-room clock.... Donât you understand? Narrow, you knowâgray,
 25095	light gray...â
 25096	
 25097	âWhat rubbish youâre talking!â said the countess.
 25098	
 25099	NatÃ¡sha continued: âDonât you really understand? Nicholas would
 25100	understand.... BezÃºkhov, now, is blue, dark-blue and red, and he is
 25101	square.â
 25102	
 25103	âYou flirt with him too,â said the countess, laughing.
 25104	
 25105	âNo, he is a Freemason, I have found out. He is fine, dark-blue and
 25106	red.... How can I explain it to you?â
 25107	
 25108	âLittle countess!â the countâs voice called from behind the door.
 25109	âYouâre not asleep?â NatÃ¡sha jumped up, snatched up her slippers,
 25110	and ran barefoot to her own room.
 25111	
 25112	It was a long time before she could sleep. She kept thinking that no one
 25113	could understand all that she understood and all there was in her.
 25114	
 25115	âSÃ³nya?â she thought, glancing at that curled-up, sleeping little
 25116	kitten with her enormous plait of hair. âNo, how could she? Sheâs
 25117	virtuous. She fell in love with Nicholas and does not wish to know
 25118	anything more. Even Mamma does not understand. It is wonderful how
 25119	clever I am and how... charming she is,â she went on, speaking
 25120	of herself in the third person, and imagining it was some very wise
 25121	manâthe wisest and best of menâwho was saying it of her. âThere
 25122	is everything, everything in her,â continued this man. âShe is
 25123	unusually intelligent, charming... and then she is pretty, uncommonly
 25124	pretty, and agileâshe swims and rides splendidly... and her voice! One
 25125	can really say itâs a wonderful voice!â
 25126	
 25127	She hummed a scrap from her favorite opera by Cherubini, threw herself
 25128	on her bed, laughed at the pleasant thought that she would immediately
 25129	fall asleep, called DunyÃ¡sha the maid to put out the candle, and before
 25130	DunyÃ¡sha had left the room had already passed into yet another happier
 25131	world of dreams, where everything was as light and beautiful as in
 25132	reality, and even more so because it was different.
 25133	
 25134	Next day the countess called BorÃ­s aside and had a talk with him, after
 25135	which he ceased coming to the RostÃ³vsâ.
 25136	
 25137	
 25138	
 25139	
 25140	
 25141	CHAPTER XIV
 25142	
 25143	On the thirty-first of December, New Yearâs Eve, 1809 - 10 an old
 25144	grandee of Catherineâs day was giving a ball and midnight supper. The
 25145	diplomatic corps and the Emperor himself were to be present.
 25146	
 25147	The grandeeâs well-known mansion on the English Quay glittered with
 25148	innumerable lights. Police were stationed at the brightly lit entrance
 25149	which was carpeted with red baize, and not only gendarmes but dozens of
 25150	police officers and even the police master himself stood at the porch.
 25151	Carriages kept driving away and fresh ones arriving, with red-liveried
 25152	footmen and footmen in plumed hats. From the carriages emerged men
 25153	wearing uniforms, stars, and ribbons, while ladies in satin and ermine
 25154	cautiously descended the carriage steps which were let down for them
 25155	with a clatter, and then walked hurriedly and noiselessly over the baize
 25156	at the entrance.
 25157	
 25158	Almost every time a new carriage drove up a whisper ran through the
 25159	crowd and caps were doffed.
 25160	
 25161	âThe Emperor?... No, a minister... prince... ambassador. Donât you
 25162	see the plumes?...â was whispered among the crowd.
 25163	
 25164	One person, better dressed than the rest, seemed to know everyone and
 25165	mentioned by name the greatest dignitaries of the day.
 25166	
 25167	A third of the visitors had already arrived, but the RostÃ³vs, who were
 25168	to be present, were still hurrying to get dressed.
 25169	
 25170	There had been many discussions and preparations for this ball in the
 25171	RostÃ³v family, many fears that the invitation would not arrive, that
 25172	the dresses would not be ready, or that something would not be arranged
 25173	as it should be.
 25174	
 25175	MÃ¡rya IgnÃ¡tevna PerÃ³nskaya, a thin and shallow maid of honor at
 25176	the court of the Dowager Empress, who was a friend and relation of the
 25177	countess and piloted the provincial RostÃ³vs in Petersburg high society,
 25178	was to accompany them to the ball.
 25179	
 25180	They were to call for her at her house in the Taurida Gardens at ten
 25181	oâclock, but it was already five minutes to ten, and the girls were
 25182	not yet dressed.
 25183	
 25184	NatÃ¡sha was going to her first grand ball. She had got up at eight that
 25185	morning and had been in a fever of excitement and activity all day. All
 25186	her powers since morning had been concentrated on ensuring that they
 25187	allâshe herself, Mamma, and SÃ³nyaâshould be as well dressed as
 25188	possible. SÃ³nya and her mother put themselves entirely in her hands.
 25189	The countess was to wear a claret-colored velvet dress, and the two
 25190	girls white gauze over pink silk slips, with roses on their bodices and
 25191	their hair dressed Ã  la grecque.
 25192	
 25193	Everything essential had already been done; feet, hands, necks, and
 25194	ears washed, perfumed, and powdered, as befits a ball; the openwork
 25195	silk stockings and white satin shoes with ribbons were already on; the
 25196	hairdressing was almost done. SÃ³nya was finishing dressing and so was
 25197	the countess, but NatÃ¡sha, who had bustled about helping them all, was
 25198	behindhand. She was still sitting before a looking-glass with a dressing
 25199	jacket thrown over her slender shoulders. SÃ³nya stood ready dressed in
 25200	the middle of the room and, pressing the head of a pin till it hurt her
 25201	dainty finger, was fixing on a last ribbon that squeaked as the pin went
 25202	through it.
 25203	
 25204	âThatâs not the way, thatâs not the way, SÃ³nya!â cried NatÃ¡sha
 25205	turning her head and clutching with both hands at her hair which the
 25206	maid who was dressing it had not time to release. âThat bow is not
 25207	right. Come here!â
 25208	
 25209	SÃ³nya sat down and NatÃ¡sha pinned the ribbon on differently.
 25210	
 25211	âAllow me, Miss! I canât do it like that,â said the maid who was
 25212	holding NatÃ¡shaâs hair.
 25213	
 25214	âOh, dear! Well then, wait. Thatâs right, SÃ³nya.â
 25215	
 25216	âArenât you ready? It is nearly ten,â came the countessâ voice.
 25217	
 25218	âDirectly! Directly! And you, Mamma?â
 25219	
 25220	âI have only my cap to pin on.â
 25221	
 25222	âDonât do it without me!â called NatÃ¡sha. âYou wonât do it
 25223	right.â
 25224	
 25225	âBut itâs already ten.â
 25226	
 25227	They had decided to be at the ball by half-past ten, and NatÃ¡sha had
 25228	still to get dressed and they had to call at the Taurida Gardens.
 25229	
 25230	When her hair was done, NatÃ¡sha, in her short petticoat from under
 25231	which her dancing shoes showed, and in her motherâs dressing jacket,
 25232	ran up to SÃ³nya, scrutinized her, and then ran to her mother. Turning
 25233	her motherâs head this way and that, she fastened on the cap and,
 25234	hurriedly kissing her gray hair, ran back to the maids who were turning
 25235	up the hem of her skirt.
 25236	
 25237	The cause of the delay was NatÃ¡shaâs skirt, which was too long.
 25238	Two maids were turning up the hem and hurriedly biting off the ends of
 25239	thread. A third with pins in her mouth was running about between the
 25240	countess and SÃ³nya, and a fourth held the whole of the gossamer garment
 25241	up high on one uplifted hand.
 25242	
 25243	âMÃ¡vra, quicker, darling!â
 25244	
 25245	âGive me my thimble, Miss, from there...â
 25246	
 25247	âWhenever will you be ready?â asked the count coming to the door.
 25248	âHere is some scent. PerÃ³nskaya must be tired of waiting.â
 25249	
 25250	âItâs ready, Miss,â said the maid, holding up the shortened gauze
 25251	dress with two fingers, and blowing and shaking something off it, as if
 25252	by this to express a consciousness of the airiness and purity of what
 25253	she held.
 25254	
 25255	NatÃ¡sha began putting on the dress.
 25256	
 25257	âIn a minute! In a minute! Donât come in, Papa!â she cried to her
 25258	father as he opened the doorâspeaking from under the filmy skirt which
 25259	still covered her whole face.
 25260	
 25261	SÃ³nya slammed the door to. A minute later they let the count in. He was
 25262	wearing a blue swallow-tail coat, shoes and stockings, and was perfumed
 25263	and his hair pomaded.
 25264	
 25265	âOh, Papa! how nice you look! Charming!â cried NatÃ¡sha, as she
 25266	stood in the middle of the room smoothing out the folds of the gauze.
 25267	
 25268	âIf you please, Miss! allow me,â said the maid, who on her knees was
 25269	pulling the skirt straight and shifting the pins from one side of her
 25270	mouth to the other with her tongue.
 25271	
 25272	âSay what you like,â exclaimed SÃ³nya, in a despairing voice as she
 25273	looked at NatÃ¡sha, âsay what you like, itâs still too long.â
 25274	
 25275	NatÃ¡sha stepped back to look at herself in the pier glass. The dress
 25276	was too long.
 25277	
 25278	âReally, madam, it is not at all too long,â said MÃ¡vra, crawling on
 25279	her knees after her young lady.
 25280	
 25281	âWell, if itâs too long weâll tack it up... weâll tack it up
 25282	in one minute,â said the resolute DunyÃ¡sha taking a needle that was
 25283	stuck on the front of her little shawl and, still kneeling on the floor,
 25284	set to work once more.
 25285	
 25286	At that moment, with soft steps, the countess came in shyly, in her cap
 25287	and velvet gown.
 25288	
 25289	âOo-oo, my beauty!â exclaimed the count, âshe looks better than
 25290	any of you!â
 25291	
 25292	He would have embraced her but, blushing, she stepped aside fearing to
 25293	be rumpled.
 25294	
 25295	âMamma, your cap, more to this side,â said NatÃ¡sha. âIâll
 25296	arrange it,â and she rushed forward so that the maids who were tacking
 25297	up her skirt could not move fast enough and a piece of gauze was torn
 25298	off.
 25299	
 25300	âOh goodness! What has happened? Really it was not my fault!â
 25301	
 25302	âNever mind, Iâll run it up, it wonât show,â said DunyÃ¡sha.
 25303	
 25304	âWhat a beautyâa very queen!â said the nurse as she came to the
 25305	door. âAnd SÃ³nya! They are lovely!â
 25306	
 25307	At a quarter past ten they at last got into their carriages and started.
 25308	But they had still to call at the Taurida Gardens.
 25309	
 25310	PerÃ³nskaya was quite ready. In spite of her age and plainness she
 25311	had gone through the same process as the RostÃ³vs, but with less
 25312	flurryâfor to her it was a matter of routine. Her ugly old body was
 25313	washed, perfumed, and powdered in just the same way. She had washed
 25314	behind her ears just as carefully, and when she entered her drawing
 25315	room in her yellow dress, wearing her badge as maid of honor, her old
 25316	ladyâs maid was as full of rapturous admiration as the RostÃ³vsâ
 25317	servants had been.
 25318	
 25319	She praised the RostÃ³vsâ toilets. They praised her taste and toilet,
 25320	and at eleven oâclock, careful of their coiffures and dresses, they
 25321	settled themselves in their carriages and drove off.
 25322	
 25323	
 25324	
 25325	
 25326	
 25327	CHAPTER XV
 25328	
 25329	NatÃ¡sha had not had a moment free since early morning and had not once
 25330	had time to think of what lay before her.
 25331	
 25332	In the damp chill air and crowded closeness of the swaying carriage, she
 25333	for the first time vividly imagined what was in store for her there at
 25334	the ball, in those brightly lighted roomsâwith music, flowers, dances,
 25335	the Emperor, and all the brilliant young people of Petersburg. The
 25336	prospect was so splendid that she hardly believed it would come true,
 25337	so out of keeping was it with the chill darkness and closeness of the
 25338	carriage. She understood all that awaited her only when, after stepping
 25339	over the red baize at the entrance, she entered the hall, took off her
 25340	fur cloak, and, beside SÃ³nya and in front of her mother, mounted the
 25341	brightly illuminated stairs between the flowers. Only then did she
 25342	remember how she must behave at a ball, and tried to assume the majestic
 25343	air she considered indispensable for a girl on such an occasion. But,
 25344	fortunately for her, she felt her eyes growing misty, she saw nothing
 25345	clearly, her pulse beat a hundred to the minute, and the blood throbbed
 25346	at her heart. She could not assume that pose, which would have made her
 25347	ridiculous, and she moved on almost fainting from excitement and trying
 25348	with all her might to conceal it. And this was the very attitude that
 25349	became her best. Before and behind them other visitors were entering,
 25350	also talking in low tones and wearing ball dresses. The mirrors on the
 25351	landing reflected ladies in white, pale-blue, and pink dresses, with
 25352	diamonds and pearls on their bare necks and arms.
 25353	
 25354	NatÃ¡sha looked in the mirrors and could not distinguish her reflection
 25355	from the others. All was blended into one brilliant procession.
 25356	On entering the ballroom the regular hum of voices, footsteps, and
 25357	greetings deafened NatÃ¡sha, and the light and glitter dazzled her still
 25358	more. The host and hostess, who had already been standing at the door
 25359	for half an hour repeating the same words to the various arrivals,
 25360	âCharmÃ© de vous voir,â * greeted the RostÃ³vs and PerÃ³nskaya in
 25361	the same manner.
 25362	
 25363	    * âDelighted to see you.â
 25364	
 25365	
 25366	The two girls in their white dresses, each with a rose in her
 25367	black hair, both curtsied in the same way, but the hostessâ eye
 25368	involuntarily rested longer on the slim NatÃ¡sha. She looked at her
 25369	and gave her alone a special smile in addition to her usual smile as
 25370	hostess. Looking at her she may have recalled the golden, irrecoverable
 25371	days of her own girlhood and her own first ball. The host also followed
 25372	NatÃ¡sha with his eyes and asked the count which was his daughter.
 25373	
 25374	âCharming!â said he, kissing the tips of his fingers.
 25375	
 25376	In the ballroom guests stood crowding at the entrance doors awaiting
 25377	the Emperor. The countess took up a position in one of the front rows
 25378	of that crowd. NatÃ¡sha heard and felt that several people were asking
 25379	about her and looking at her. She realized that those noticing her liked
 25380	her, and this observation helped to calm her.
 25381	
 25382	âThere are some like ourselves and some worse,â she thought.
 25383	
 25384	PerÃ³nskaya was pointing out to the countess the most important people
 25385	at the ball.
 25386	
 25387	âThat is the Dutch ambassador, do you see? That gray-haired man,â
 25388	she said, indicating an old man with a profusion of silver-gray curly
 25389	hair, who was surrounded by ladies laughing at something he said.
 25390	
 25391	âAh, here she is, the Queen of Petersburg, Countess BezÃºkhova,â
 25392	said PerÃ³nskaya, indicating HÃ©lÃ¨ne who had just entered. âHow
 25393	lovely! She is quite equal to MÃ¡rya AntÃ³novna. See how the men, young
 25394	and old, pay court to her. Beautiful and clever... they say Prince
 25395	ââ is quite mad about her. But see, those two, though not
 25396	good-looking, are even more run after.â
 25397	
 25398	She pointed to a lady who was crossing the room followed by a very plain
 25399	daughter.
 25400	
 25401	âShe is a splendid match, a millionairess,â said PerÃ³nskaya. âAnd
 25402	look, here come her suitors.â
 25403	
 25404	âThat is BezÃºkhovaâs brother, Anatole KurÃ¡gin,â she said,
 25405	indicating a handsome officer of the Horse Guards who passed by them
 25406	with head erect, looking at something over the heads of the ladies.
 25407	âHeâs handsome, isnât he? I hear they will marry him to that rich
 25408	girl. But your cousin, DrubetskÃ³y, is also very attentive to her. They
 25409	say she has millions. Oh yes, thatâs the French ambassador himself!â
 25410	she replied to the countessâ inquiry about Caulaincourt. âLooks as
 25411	if he were a king! All the same, the French are charming, very charming.
 25412	No one more charming in society. Ah, here she is! Yes, she is still the
 25413	most beautiful of them all, our MÃ¡rya AntÃ³novna! And how simply she
 25414	is dressed! Lovely! And that stout one in spectacles is the universal
 25415	Freemason,â she went on, indicating Pierre. âPut him beside his wife
 25416	and he looks a regular buffoon!â
 25417	
 25418	Pierre, swaying his stout body, advanced, making way through the crowd
 25419	and nodding to right and left as casually and good-naturedly as if he
 25420	were passing through a crowd at a fair. He pushed through, evidently
 25421	looking for someone.
 25422	
 25423	NatÃ¡sha looked joyfully at the familiar face of Pierre, âthe
 25424	buffoon,â as PerÃ³nskaya had called him, and knew he was looking for
 25425	them, and for her in particular. He had promised to be at the ball and
 25426	introduce partners to her.
 25427	
 25428	But before he reached them Pierre stopped beside a very handsome, dark
 25429	man of middle height, and in a white uniform, who stood by a window
 25430	talking to a tall man wearing stars and a ribbon. NatÃ¡sha at once
 25431	recognized the shorter and younger man in the white uniform: it was
 25432	BolkÃ³nski, who seemed to her to have grown much younger, happier, and
 25433	better-looking.
 25434	
 25435	âThereâs someone else we knowâBolkÃ³nski, do you see, Mamma?â
 25436	said NatÃ¡sha, pointing out Prince Andrew. âYou remember, he stayed a
 25437	night with us at OtrÃ¡dnoe.â
 25438	
 25439	âOh, you know him?â said PerÃ³nskaya. âI canât bear him. Il fait
 25440	Ã  prÃ©sent la pluie et le beau temps. * Heâs too proud for anything.
 25441	Takes after his father. And heâs hand in glove with SperÃ¡nski,
 25442	writing some project or other. Just look how he treats the ladies!
 25443	Thereâs one talking to him and he has turned away,â she said,
 25444	pointing at him. âIâd give it to him if he treated me as he does
 25445	those ladies.â
 25446	
 25447	    * âHe is all the rage just now.â
 25448	
 25449	
 25450	
 25451	
 25452	
 25453	
 25454	CHAPTER XVI
 25455	
 25456	Suddenly everybody stirred, began talking, and pressed forward and then
 25457	back, and between the two rows, which separated, the Emperor entered to
 25458	the sounds of music that had immediately struck up. Behind him walked
 25459	his host and hostess. He walked in rapidly, bowing to right and left
 25460	as if anxious to get the first moments of the reception over. The band
 25461	played the polonaise in vogue at that time on account of the words that
 25462	had been set to it, beginning: âAlexander, Elisaveta, all our hearts
 25463	you ravish quite...â The Emperor passed on to the drawing room, the
 25464	crowd made a rush for the doors, and several persons with excited faces
 25465	hurried there and back again. Then the crowd hastily retired from
 25466	the drawing room door, at which the Emperor reappeared talking to the
 25467	hostess. A young man, looking distraught, pounced down on the ladies,
 25468	asking them to move aside. Some ladies, with faces betraying complete
 25469	forgetfulness of all the rules of decorum, pushed forward to the
 25470	detriment of their toilets. The men began to choose partners and take
 25471	their places for the polonaise.
 25472	
 25473	Everyone moved back, and the Emperor came smiling out of the drawing
 25474	room leading his hostess by the hand but not keeping time to the
 25475	music. The host followed with MÃ¡rya AntÃ³novna NarÃ½shkina; then
 25476	came ambassadors, ministers, and various generals, whom PerÃ³nskaya
 25477	diligently named. More than half the ladies already had partners
 25478	and were taking up, or preparing to take up, their positions for the
 25479	polonaise. NatÃ¡sha felt that she would be left with her mother and
 25480	SÃ³nya among a minority of women who crowded near the wall, not having
 25481	been invited to dance. She stood with her slender arms hanging down,
 25482	her scarcely defined bosom rising and falling regularly, and with
 25483	bated breath and glittering, frightened eyes gazed straight before
 25484	her, evidently prepared for the height of joy or misery. She was
 25485	not concerned about the Emperor or any of those great people whom
 25486	PerÃ³nskaya was pointing outâshe had but one thought: âIs it
 25487	possible no one will ask me, that I shall not be among the first to
 25488	dance? Is it possible that not one of all these men will notice me?
 25489	They do not even seem to see me, or if they do they look as if they
 25490	were saying, âAh, sheâs not the one Iâm after, so itâs not worth
 25491	looking at her!â No, itâs impossible,â she thought. âThey must
 25492	know how I long to dance, how splendidly I dance, and how they would
 25493	enjoy dancing with me.â
 25494	
 25495	The strains of the polonaise, which had continued for a considerable
 25496	time, had begun to sound like a sad reminiscence to NatÃ¡shaâs ears.
 25497	She wanted to cry. PerÃ³nskaya had left them. The count was at the
 25498	other end of the room. She and the countess and SÃ³nya were standing by
 25499	themselves as in the depths of a forest amid that crowd of strangers,
 25500	with no one interested in them and not wanted by anyone. Prince Andrew
 25501	with a lady passed by, evidently not recognizing them. The handsome
 25502	Anatole was smilingly talking to a partner on his arm and looked at
 25503	NatÃ¡sha as one looks at a wall. BorÃ­s passed them twice and each time
 25504	turned away. Berg and his wife, who were not dancing, came up to them.
 25505	
 25506	This family gathering seemed humiliating to NatÃ¡shaâas if there were
 25507	nowhere else for the family to talk but here at the ball. She did not
 25508	listen to or look at VÃ©ra, who was telling her something about her own
 25509	green dress.
 25510	
 25511	At last the Emperor stopped beside his last partner (he had danced
 25512	with three) and the music ceased. A worried aide-de-camp ran up to the
 25513	RostÃ³vs requesting them to stand farther back, though as it was they
 25514	were already close to the wall, and from the gallery resounded the
 25515	distinct, precise, enticingly rhythmical strains of a waltz. The Emperor
 25516	looked smilingly down the room. A minute passed but no one had yet begun
 25517	dancing. An aide-de-camp, the Master of Ceremonies, went up to Countess
 25518	BezÃºkhova and asked her to dance. She smilingly raised her hand and
 25519	laid it on his shoulder without looking at him. The aide-de-camp, an
 25520	adept in his art, grasping his partner firmly round her waist, with
 25521	confident deliberation started smoothly, gliding first round the edge of
 25522	the circle, then at the corner of the room he caught HÃ©lÃ¨neâs
 25523	left hand and turned her, the only sound audible, apart from the
 25524	ever-quickening music, being the rhythmic click of the spurs on his
 25525	rapid, agile feet, while at every third beat his partnerâs velvet
 25526	dress spread out and seemed to flash as she whirled round. NatÃ¡sha
 25527	gazed at them and was ready to cry because it was not she who was
 25528	dancing that first turn of the waltz.
 25529	
 25530	Prince Andrew, in the white uniform of a cavalry colonel, wearing
 25531	stockings and dancing shoes, stood looking animated and bright in the
 25532	front row of the circle not far from the RostÃ³vs. Baron Firhoff was
 25533	talking to him about the first sitting of the Council of State to be
 25534	held next day. Prince Andrew, as one closely connected with SperÃ¡nski
 25535	and participating in the work of the legislative commission, could give
 25536	reliable information about that sitting, concerning which various rumors
 25537	were current. But not listening to what Firhoff was saying, he was
 25538	gazing now at the sovereign and now at the men intending to dance who
 25539	had not yet gathered courage to enter the circle.
 25540	
 25541	Prince Andrew was watching these men abashed by the Emperorâs
 25542	presence, and the women who were breathlessly longing to be asked to
 25543	dance.
 25544	
 25545	Pierre came up to him and caught him by the arm.
 25546	
 25547	âYou always dance. I have a protÃ©gÃ©e, the young RostÃ³va, here. Ask
 25548	her,â he said.
 25549	
 25550	âWhere is she?â asked BolkÃ³nski. âExcuse me!â he added, turning
 25551	to the baron, âwe will finish this conversation elsewhereâat a ball
 25552	one must dance.â He stepped forward in the direction Pierre indicated.
 25553	The despairing, dejected expression of NatÃ¡shaâs face caught his eye.
 25554	He recognized her, guessed her feelings, saw that it was her dÃ©but,
 25555	remembered her conversation at the window, and with an expression of
 25556	pleasure on his face approached Countess RostÃ³va.
 25557	
 25558	âAllow me to introduce you to my daughter,â said the countess, with
 25559	heightened color.
 25560	
 25561	âI have the pleasure of being already acquainted, if the countess
 25562	remembers me,â said Prince Andrew with a low and courteous bow quite
 25563	belying PerÃ³nskayaâs remarks about his rudeness, and approaching
 25564	NatÃ¡sha he held out his arm to grasp her waist before he had completed
 25565	his invitation. He asked her to waltz. That tremulous expression on
 25566	NatÃ¡shaâs face, prepared either for despair or rapture, suddenly
 25567	brightened into a happy, grateful, childlike smile.
 25568	
 25569	âI have long been waiting for you,â that frightened happy little
 25570	girl seemed to say by the smile that replaced the threatened tears, as
 25571	she raised her hand to Prince Andrewâs shoulder. They were the second
 25572	couple to enter the circle. Prince Andrew was one of the best dancers of
 25573	his day and NatÃ¡sha danced exquisitely. Her little feet in their white
 25574	satin dancing shoes did their work swiftly, lightly, and independently
 25575	of herself, while her face beamed with ecstatic happiness. Her slender
 25576	bare arms and neck were not beautifulâcompared to HÃ©lÃ¨neâs her
 25577	shoulders looked thin and her bosom undeveloped. But HÃ©lÃ¨ne seemed, as
 25578	it were, hardened by a varnish left by the thousands of looks that had
 25579	scanned her person, while NatÃ¡sha was like a girl exposed for the first
 25580	time, who would have felt very much ashamed had she not been assured
 25581	that this was absolutely necessary.
 25582	
 25583	Prince Andrew liked dancing, and wishing to escape as quickly as
 25584	possible from the political and clever talk which everyone addressed
 25585	to him, wishing also to break up the circle of restraint he disliked,
 25586	caused by the Emperorâs presence, he danced, and had chosen NatÃ¡sha
 25587	because Pierre pointed her out to him and because she was the first
 25588	pretty girl who caught his eye; but scarcely had he embraced that
 25589	slender supple figure and felt her stirring so close to him and smiling
 25590	so near him than the wine of her charm rose to his head, and he
 25591	felt himself revived and rejuvenated when after leaving her he stood
 25592	breathing deeply and watching the other dancers.

 25598	CHAPTER XVII
 25599	
 25600	After Prince Andrew, BorÃ­s came up to ask NatÃ¡sha for a dance, and
 25601	then the aide-de-camp who had opened the ball, and several other young
 25602	men, so that, flushed and happy, and passing on her superfluous partners
 25603	to SÃ³nya, she did not cease dancing all the evening. She noticed and
 25604	saw nothing of what occupied everyone else. Not only did she fail to
 25605	notice that the Emperor talked a long time with the French ambassador,
 25606	and how particularly gracious he was to a certain lady, or that Prince
 25607	So-and-so and So-and-so did and said this and that, and that HÃ©lÃ¨ne
 25608	had great success and was honored by the special attention of So-and-so,
 25609	but she did not even see the Emperor, and only noticed that he had gone
 25610	because the ball became livelier after his departure. For one of the
 25611	merry cotillions before supper Prince Andrew was again her partner. He
 25612	reminded her of their first encounter in the OtrÃ¡dnoe avenue, and how
 25613	she had been unable to sleep that moonlight night, and told her how he
 25614	had involuntarily overheard her. NatÃ¡sha blushed at that recollection
 25615	and tried to excuse herself, as if there had been something to be
 25616	ashamed of in what Prince Andrew had overheard.
 25617	
 25618	Like all men who have grown up in society, Prince Andrew liked meeting
 25619	someone there not of the conventional society stamp. And such was
 25620	NatÃ¡sha, with her surprise, her delight, her shyness, and even her
 25621	mistakes in speaking French. With her he behaved with special care and
 25622	tenderness, sitting beside her and talking of the simplest and most
 25623	unimportant matters; he admired her shy grace. In the middle of the
 25624	cotillion, having completed one of the figures, NatÃ¡sha, still out of
 25625	breath, was returning to her seat when another dancer chose her. She was
 25626	tired and panting and evidently thought of declining, but immediately
 25627	put her hand gaily on the manâs shoulder, smiling at Prince Andrew.
 25628	
 25629	âIâd be glad to sit beside you and rest: Iâm tired; but you see
 25630	how they keep asking me, and Iâm glad of it, Iâm happy and I love
 25631	everybody, and you and I understand it all,â and much, much more was
 25632	said in her smile. When her partner left her NatÃ¡sha ran across the
 25633	room to choose two ladies for the figure.
 25634	
 25635	âIf she goes to her cousin first and then to another lady, she will be
 25636	my wife,â said Prince Andrew to himself quite to his own surprise, as
 25637	he watched her. She did go first to her cousin.
 25638	
 25639	âWhat rubbish sometimes enters oneâs head!â thought Prince Andrew,
 25640	âbut what is certain is that that girl is so charming, so original,
 25641	that she wonât be dancing here a month before she will be married....
 25642	Such as she are rare here,â he thought, as NatÃ¡sha, readjusting a
 25643	rose that was slipping on her bodice, settled herself beside him.
 25644	
 25645	When the cotillion was over the old count in his blue coat came up to
 25646	the dancers. He invited Prince Andrew to come and see them, and asked
 25647	his daughter whether she was enjoying herself. NatÃ¡sha did not answer
 25648	at once but only looked up with a smile that said reproachfully: âHow
 25649	can you ask such a question?â
 25650	
 25651	âI have never enjoyed myself so much before!â she said, and Prince
 25652	Andrew noticed how her thin arms rose quickly as if to embrace her
 25653	father and instantly dropped again. NatÃ¡sha was happier than she had
 25654	ever been in her life. She was at that height of bliss when one becomes
 25655	completely kind and good and does not believe in the possibility of
 25656	evil, unhappiness, or sorrow.
 25657	
 25658	At that ball Pierre for the first time felt humiliated by the position
 25659	his wife occupied in court circles. He was gloomy and absent-minded. A
 25660	deep furrow ran across his forehead, and standing by a window he stared
 25661	over his spectacles seeing no one.
 25662	
 25663	On her way to supper NatÃ¡sha passed him.
 25664	
 25665	Pierreâs gloomy, unhappy look struck her. She stopped in front of him.
 25666	She wished to help him, to bestow on him the superabundance of her own
 25667	happiness.
 25668	
 25669	âHow delightful it is, Count!â said she. âIsnât it?â
 25670	
 25671	Pierre smiled absent-mindedly, evidently not grasping what she said.
 25672	
 25673	âYes, I am very glad,â he said.
 25674	
 25675	âHow can people be dissatisfied with anything?â thought NatÃ¡sha.
 25676	âEspecially such a capital fellow as BezÃºkhov!â In NatÃ¡shaâs
 25677	eyes all the people at the ball alike were good, kind, and splendid
 25678	people, loving one another; none of them capable of injuring
 25679	anotherâand so they ought all to be happy.
 25680	
 25681	
 25682	
 25683	
 25684	
 25685	CHAPTER XVIII
 25686	
 25687	Next day Prince Andrew thought of the ball, but his mind did not dwell
 25688	on it long. âYes, it was a very brilliant ball,â and then... âYes,
 25689	that little RostÃ³va is very charming. Thereâs something fresh,
 25690	original, un-Petersburg-like about her that distinguishes her.â That
 25691	was all he thought about yesterdayâs ball, and after his morning tea
 25692	he set to work.
 25693	
 25694	But either from fatigue or want of sleep he was ill-disposed for work
 25695	and could get nothing done. He kept criticizing his own work, as he
 25696	often did, and was glad when he heard someone coming.
 25697	
 25698	The visitor was BÃ­tski, who served on various committees, frequented
 25699	all the societies in Petersburg, and a passionate devotee of the new
 25700	ideas and of SperÃ¡nski, and a diligent Petersburg newsmongerâone of
 25701	those men who choose their opinions like their clothes according to
 25702	the fashion, but who for that very reason appear to be the warmest
 25703	partisans. Hardly had he got rid of his hat before he ran into Prince
 25704	Andrewâs room with a preoccupied air and at once began talking. He
 25705	had just heard particulars of that morningâs sitting of the Council
 25706	of State opened by the Emperor, and he spoke of it enthusiastically. The
 25707	Emperorâs speech had been extraordinary. It had been a speech such as
 25708	only constitutional monarchs deliver. âThe Sovereign plainly said
 25709	that the Council and Senate are estates of the realm, he said that the
 25710	government must rest not on authority but on secure bases. The Emperor
 25711	said that the fiscal system must be reorganized and the accounts
 25712	published,â recounted BÃ­tski, emphasizing certain words and opening
 25713	his eyes significantly.
 25714	
 25715	âAh, yes! Todayâs events mark an epoch, the greatest epoch in our
 25716	history,â he concluded.
 25717	
 25718	Prince Andrew listened to the account of the opening of the Council of
 25719	State, which he had so impatiently awaited and to which he had attached
 25720	such importance, and was surprised that this event, now that it had
 25721	taken place, did not affect him, and even seemed quite insignificant. He
 25722	listened with quiet irony to BÃ­tskiâs enthusiastic account of it. A
 25723	very simple thought occurred to him: âWhat does it matter to me or to
 25724	BÃ­tski what the Emperor was pleased to say at the Council? Can all that
 25725	make me any happier or better?â
 25726	
 25727	And this simple reflection suddenly destroyed all the interest Prince
 25728	Andrew had felt in the impending reforms. He was going to dine that
 25729	evening at SperÃ¡nskiâs, âwith only a few friends,â as the host
 25730	had said when inviting him. The prospect of that dinner in the intimate
 25731	home circle of the man he so admired had greatly interested Prince
 25732	Andrew, especially as he had not yet seen SperÃ¡nski in his domestic
 25733	surroundings, but now he felt disinclined to go to it.
 25734	
 25735	At the appointed hour, however, he entered the modest house SperÃ¡nski
 25736	owned in the Taurida Gardens. In the parqueted dining room this small
 25737	house, remarkable for its extreme cleanliness (suggesting that of a
 25738	monastery), Prince Andrew, who was rather late, found the friendly
 25739	gathering of SperÃ¡nskiâs intimate acquaintances already assembled
 25740	at five oâclock. There were no ladies present except SperÃ¡nskiâs
 25741	little daughter (long-faced like her father) and her governess. The
 25742	other guests were Gervais, MagnÃ­tski, and StolÃ½pin. While still in
 25743	the anteroom Prince Andrew heard loud voices and a ringing staccato
 25744	laughâa laugh such as one hears on the stage. Someoneâit sounded
 25745	like SperÃ¡nskiâwas distinctly ejaculating ha-ha-ha. Prince Andrew
 25746	had never before heard SperÃ¡nskiâs famous laugh, and this ringing,
 25747	high-pitched laughter from a statesman made a strange impression on him.
 25748	
 25749	He entered the dining room. The whole company were standing between two
 25750	windows at a small table laid with hors-dâoeuvres. SperÃ¡nski, wearing
 25751	a gray swallow-tail coat with a star on the breast, and evidently still
 25752	the same waistcoat and high white stock he had worn at the meeting of
 25753	the Council of State, stood at the table with a beaming countenance. His
 25754	guests surrounded him. MagnÃ­tski, addressing himself to SperÃ¡nski,
 25755	was relating an anecdote, and SperÃ¡nski was laughing in advance at
 25756	what MagnÃ­tski was going to say. When Prince Andrew entered the room
 25757	MagnÃ­tskiâs words were again crowned by laughter. StolÃ½pin gave
 25758	a deep bass guffaw as he munched a piece of bread and cheese. Gervais
 25759	laughed softly with a hissing chuckle, and SperÃ¡nski in a high-pitched
 25760	staccato manner.
 25761	
 25762	Still laughing, SperÃ¡nski held out his soft white hand to Prince
 25763	Andrew.
 25764	
 25765	âVery pleased to see you, Prince,â he said. âOne moment...â he
 25766	went on, turning to MagnÃ­tski and interrupting his story. âWe have
 25767	agreed that this is a dinner for recreation, with not a word about
 25768	business!â and turning again to the narrator he began to laugh afresh.
 25769	
 25770	Prince Andrew looked at the laughing SperÃ¡nski with astonishment,
 25771	regret, and disillusionment. It seemed to him that this was not
 25772	SperÃ¡nski but someone else. Everything that had formerly appeared
 25773	mysterious and fascinating in SperÃ¡nski suddenly became plain and
 25774	unattractive.
 25775	
 25776	At dinner the conversation did not cease for a moment and seemed to
 25777	consist of the contents of a book of funny anecdotes. Before MagnÃ­tski
 25778	had finished his story someone else was anxious to relate something
 25779	still funnier. Most of the anecdotes, if not relating to the state
 25780	service, related to people in the service. It seemed that in this
 25781	company the insignificance of those people was so definitely accepted
 25782	that the only possible attitude toward them was one of good humored
 25783	ridicule. SperÃ¡nski related how at the Council that morning a deaf
 25784	dignitary, when asked his opinion, replied that he thought so too.
 25785	Gervais gave a long account of an official revision, remarkable for the
 25786	stupidity of everybody concerned. StolÃ½pin, stuttering, broke into
 25787	the conversation and began excitedly talking of the abuses that existed
 25788	under the former order of thingsâthreatening to give a serious turn
 25789	to the conversation. MagnÃ­tski starting quizzing StolÃ½pin about his
 25790	vehemence. Gervais intervened with a joke, and the talk reverted to its
 25791	former lively tone.
 25792	
 25793	Evidently SperÃ¡nski liked to rest after his labors and find amusement
 25794	in a circle of friends, and his guests, understanding his wish, tried
 25795	to enliven him and amuse themselves. But their gaiety seemed to Prince
 25796	Andrew mirthless and tiresome. SperÃ¡nskiâs high-pitched voice struck
 25797	him unpleasantly, and the incessant laughter grated on him like a false
 25798	note. Prince Andrew did not laugh and feared that he would be a damper
 25799	on the spirits of the company, but no one took any notice of his being
 25800	out of harmony with the general mood. They all seemed very gay.
 25801	
 25802	He tried several times to join in the conversation, but his remarks were
 25803	tossed aside each time like a cork thrown out of the water, and he could
 25804	not jest with them.
 25805	
 25806	There was nothing wrong or unseemly in what they said, it was witty and
 25807	might have been funny, but it lacked just that something which is the
 25808	salt of mirth, and they were not even aware that such a thing existed.
 25809	
 25810	After dinner SperÃ¡nskiâs daughter and her governess rose. He patted
 25811	the little girl with his white hand and kissed her. And that gesture,
 25812	too, seemed unnatural to Prince Andrew.
 25813	
 25814	The men remained at table over their portâEnglish fashion. In the
 25815	midst of a conversation that was started about Napoleonâs Spanish
 25816	affairs, which they all agreed in approving, Prince Andrew began to
 25817	express a contrary opinion. SperÃ¡nski smiled and, with an evident wish
 25818	to prevent the conversation from taking an unpleasant course, told a
 25819	story that had no connection with the previous conversation. For a few
 25820	moments all were silent.
 25821	
 25822	Having sat some time at table, SperÃ¡nski corked a bottle of wine and,
 25823	remarking, âNowadays good wine rides in a carriage and pair,â passed
 25824	it to the servant and got up. All rose and continuing to talk loudly
 25825	went into the drawing room. Two letters brought by a courier were handed
 25826	to SperÃ¡nski and he took them to his study. As soon as he had left
 25827	the room the general merriment stopped and the guests began to converse
 25828	sensibly and quietly with one another.
 25829	
 25830	âNow for the recitation!â said SperÃ¡nski on returning from
 25831	his study. âA wonderful talent!â he said to Prince Andrew, and
 25832	MagnÃ­tski immediately assumed a pose and began reciting some humorous
 25833	verses in French which he had composed about various well-known
 25834	Petersburg people. He was interrupted several times by applause. When
 25835	the verses were finished Prince Andrew went up to SperÃ¡nski and took
 25836	his leave.
 25837	
 25838	âWhere are you off to so early?â asked SperÃ¡nski.
 25839	
 25840	âI promised to go to a reception.â
 25841	
 25842	They said no more. Prince Andrew looked closely into those mirrorlike,
 25843	impenetrable eyes, and felt that it had been ridiculous of him to have
 25844	expected anything from SperÃ¡nski and from any of his own activities
 25845	connected with him, or ever to have attributed importance to what
 25846	SperÃ¡nski was doing. That precise, mirthless laughter rang in Prince
 25847	Andrewâs ears long after he had left the house.
 25848	
 25849	When he reached home Prince Andrew began thinking of his life in
 25850	Petersburg during those last four months as if it were something new. He
 25851	recalled his exertions and solicitations, and the history of his project
 25852	of army reform, which had been accepted for consideration and which they
 25853	were trying to pass over in silence simply because another, a very poor
 25854	one, had already been prepared and submitted to the Emperor. He thought
 25855	of the meetings of a committee of which Berg was a member. He remembered
 25856	how carefully and at what length everything relating to form and
 25857	procedure was discussed at those meetings, and how sedulously and
 25858	promptly all that related to the gist of the business was evaded. He
 25859	recalled his labors on the Legal Code, and how painstakingly he had
 25860	translated the articles of the Roman and French codes into Russian,
 25861	and he felt ashamed of himself. Then he vividly pictured to himself
 25862	BoguchÃ¡rovo, his occupations in the country, his journey to RyazÃ¡n;
 25863	he remembered the peasants and Dron the village elder, and mentally
 25864	applying to them the Personal Rights he had divided into paragraphs, he
 25865	felt astonished that he could have spent so much time on such useless
 25866	work.
 25867	
 25868	
 25869	
 25870	
 25871	
 25872	CHAPTER XIX
 25873	
 25874	Next day Prince Andrew called at a few houses he had not visited before,
 25875	and among them at the RostÃ³vsâ with whom he had renewed acquaintance
 25876	at the ball. Apart from considerations of politeness which demanded the
 25877	call, he wanted to see that original, eager girl who had left such a
 25878	pleasant impression on his mind, in her own home.
 25879	
 25880	NatÃ¡sha was one of the first to meet him. She was wearing a dark-blue
 25881	house dress in which Prince Andrew thought her even prettier than in
 25882	her ball dress. She and all the RostÃ³v family welcomed him as an old
 25883	friend, simply and cordially. The whole family, whom he had formerly
 25884	judged severely, now seemed to him to consist of excellent, simple,
 25885	and kindly people. The old countâs hospitality and good nature, which
 25886	struck one especially in Petersburg as a pleasant surprise, were such
 25887	that Prince Andrew could not refuse to stay to dinner. âYes,â
 25888	he thought, âthey are capital people, who of course have not the
 25889	slightest idea what a treasure they possess in NatÃ¡sha; but they are
 25890	kindly folk and form the best possible setting for this strikingly
 25891	poetic, charming girl, overflowing with life!â
 25892	
 25893	In NatÃ¡sha Prince Andrew was conscious of a strange world completely
 25894	alien to him and brimful of joys unknown to him, a different world,
 25895	that in the OtrÃ¡dnoe avenue and at the window that moonlight night
 25896	had already begun to disconcert him. Now this world disconcerted him no
 25897	longer and was no longer alien to him, but he himself having entered it
 25898	found in it a new enjoyment.
 25899	
 25900	After dinner NatÃ¡sha, at Prince Andrewâs request, went to the
 25901	clavichord and began singing. Prince Andrew stood by a window talking
 25902	to the ladies and listened to her. In the midst of a phrase he ceased
 25903	speaking and suddenly felt tears choking him, a thing he had thought
 25904	impossible for him. He looked at NatÃ¡sha as she sang, and something new
 25905	and joyful stirred in his soul. He felt happy and at the same time sad.
 25906	He had absolutely nothing to weep about yet he was ready to weep. What
 25907	about? His former love? The little princess? His disillusionments?...
 25908	His hopes for the future?... Yes and no. The chief reason was a sudden,
 25909	vivid sense of the terrible contrast between something infinitely great
 25910	and illimitable within him and that limited and material something that
 25911	he, and even she, was. This contrast weighed on and yet cheered him
 25912	while she sang.
 25913	
 25914	As soon as NatÃ¡sha had finished she went up to him and asked how he
 25915	liked her voice. She asked this and then became confused, feeling that
 25916	she ought not to have asked it. He smiled, looking at her, and said he
 25917	liked her singing as he liked everything she did.
 25918	
 25919	Prince Andrew left the RostÃ³vsâ late in the evening. He went to bed
 25920	from habit, but soon realized that he could not sleep. Having lit his
 25921	candle he sat up in bed, then got up, then lay down again not at all
 25922	troubled by his sleeplessness: his soul was as fresh and joyful as if he
 25923	had stepped out of a stuffy room into Godâs own fresh air. It did not
 25924	enter his head that he was in love with NatÃ¡sha; he was not thinking
 25925	about her, but only picturing her to himself, and in consequence all
 25926	life appeared in a new light. âWhy do I strive, why do I toil in this
 25927	narrow, confined frame, when life, all life with all its joys, is open
 25928	to me?â said he to himself. And for the first time for a very long
 25929	while he began making happy plans for the future. He decided that he
 25930	must attend to his sonâs education by finding a tutor and putting
 25931	the boy in his charge, then he ought to retire from the service and go
 25932	abroad, and see England, Switzerland and Italy. âI must use my freedom
 25933	while I feel so much strength and youth in me,â he said to himself.
 25934	âPierre was right when he said one must believe in the possibility of
 25935	happiness in order to be happy, and now I do believe in it. Let the dead
 25936	bury their dead, but while one has life one must live and be happy!â
 25937	thought he.
 25938	
 25939	
 25940	
 25941	
 25942	
 25943	CHAPTER XX
 25944	
 25945	One morning Colonel Berg, whom Pierre knew as he knew everybody in
 25946	Moscow and Petersburg, came to see him. Berg arrived in an immaculate
 25947	brand-new uniform, with his hair pomaded and brushed forward over his
 25948	temples as the Emperor Alexander wore his hair.
 25949	
 25950	âI have just been to see the countess, your wife. Unfortunately she
 25951	could not grant my request, but I hope, Count, I shall be more fortunate
 25952	with you,â he said with a smile.
 25953	
 25954	âWhat is it you wish, Colonel? I am at your service.â
 25955	
 25956	âI have now quite settled in my new rooms, Countâ (Berg said
 25957	this with perfect conviction that this information could not but be
 25958	agreeable), âand so I wish to arrange just a small party for my own
 25959	and my wifeâs friends.â (He smiled still more pleasantly.) âI
 25960	wished to ask the countess and you to do me the honor of coming to tea
 25961	and to supper.â
 25962	
 25963	Only Countess HÃ©lÃ¨ne, considering the society of such people as the
 25964	Bergs beneath her, could be cruel enough to refuse such an invitation.
 25965	Berg explained so clearly why he wanted to collect at his house a small
 25966	but select company, and why this would give him pleasure, and why though
 25967	he grudged spending money on cards or anything harmful, he was prepared
 25968	to run into some expense for the sake of good societyâthat Pierre
 25969	could not refuse, and promised to come.
 25970	
 25971	âBut donât be late, Count, if I may venture to ask; about ten
 25972	minutes to eight, please. We shall make up a rubber. Our general is
 25973	coming. He is very good to me. We shall have supper, Count. So you will
 25974	do me the favor.â
 25975	
 25976	Contrary to his habit of being late, Pierre on that day arrived at the
 25977	Bergsâ house, not at ten but at fifteen minutes to eight.
 25978	
 25979	Having prepared everything necessary for the party, the Bergs were ready
 25980	for their guestsâ arrival.
 25981	
 25982	In their new, clean, and light study with its small busts and pictures
 25983	and new furniture sat Berg and his wife. Berg, closely buttoned up in
 25984	his new uniform, sat beside his wife explaining to her that one always
 25985	could and should be acquainted with people above one, because only then
 25986	does one get satisfaction from acquaintances.
 25987	
 25988	âYou can get to know something, you can ask for something. See how I
 25989	managed from my first promotion.â (Berg measured his life not by years
 25990	but by promotions.) âMy comrades are still nobodies, while I am only
 25991	waiting for a vacancy to command a regiment, and have the happiness to
 25992	be your husband.â (He rose and kissed VÃ©raâs hand, and on the way
 25993	to her straightened out a turned-up corner of the carpet.) âAnd
 25994	how have I obtained all this? Chiefly by knowing how to choose my
 25995	aquaintances. It goes without saying that one must be conscientious and
 25996	methodical.â
 25997	
 25998	Berg smiled with a sense of his superiority over a weak woman, and
 25999	paused, reflecting that this dear wife of his was after all but a weak
 26000	woman who could not understand all that constitutes a manâs dignity,
 26001	what it was ein Mann zu sein. * VÃ©ra at the same time smiling with a
 26002	sense of superiority over her good, conscientious husband, who all the
 26003	same understood life wrongly, as according to VÃ©ra all men did. Berg,
 26004	judging by his wife, thought all women weak and foolish. VÃ©ra, judging
 26005	only by her husband and generalizing from that observation, supposed
 26006	that all men, though they understand nothing and are conceited and
 26007	selfish, ascribe common sense to themselves alone.
 26008	
 26009	    * To be a man.
 26010	
 26011	Berg rose and embraced his wife carefully, so as not to crush her lace
 26012	fichu for which he had paid a good price, kissing her straight on the
 26013	lips.
 26014	
 26015	âThe only thing is, we mustnât have children too soon,â he
 26016	continued, following an unconscious sequence of ideas.
 26017	
 26018	âYes,â answered VÃ©ra, âI donât at all want that. We must live
 26019	for society.â
 26020	
 26021	âPrincess YusÃºpova wore one exactly like this,â said Berg, pointing
 26022	to the fichu with a happy and kindly smile.
 26023	
 26024	Just then Count BezÃºkhov was announced. Husband and wife glanced at one
 26025	another, both smiling with self-satisfaction, and each mentally claiming
 26026	the honor of this visit.
 26027	
 26028	âThis is what comes of knowing how to make acquaintances,â thought
 26029	Berg. âThis is what comes of knowing how to conduct oneself.â
 26030	
 26031	âBut please donât interrupt me when I am entertaining the guests,â
 26032	said VÃ©ra, âbecause I know what interests each of them and what to
 26033	say to different people.â
 26034	
 26035	Berg smiled again.
 26036	
 26037	âIt canât be helped: men must sometimes have masculine
 26038	conversation,â said he.
 26039	
 26040	They received Pierre in their small, new drawing room, where it was
 26041	impossible to sit down anywhere without disturbing its symmetry,
 26042	neatness, and order; so it was quite comprehensible and not strange that
 26043	Berg, having generously offered to disturb the symmetry of an armchair
 26044	or of the sofa for his dear guest, but being apparently painfully
 26045	undecided on the matter himself, eventually left the visitor to settle
 26046	the question of selection. Pierre disturbed the symmetry by moving a
 26047	chair for himself, and Berg and VÃ©ra immediately began their evening
 26048	party, interrupting each other in their efforts to entertain their
 26049	guest.
 26050	
 26051	VÃ©ra, having decided in her own mind that Pierre ought to be
 26052	entertained with conversation about the French embassy, at once began
 26053	accordingly. Berg, having decided that masculine conversation was
 26054	required, interrupted his wifeâs remarks and touched on the question
 26055	of the war with Austria, and unconsciously jumped from the general
 26056	subject to personal considerations as to the proposals made him to take
 26057	part in the Austrian campaign and the reasons why he had declined them.
 26058	Though the conversation was very incoherent and VÃ©ra was angry at the
 26059	intrusion of the masculine element, both husband and wife felt with
 26060	satisfaction that, even if only one guest was present, their evening had
 26061	begun very well and was as like as two peas to every other evening party
 26062	with its talk, tea, and lighted candles.
 26063	
 26064	Before long BorÃ­s, Bergâs old comrade, arrived. There was a shade of
 26065	condescension and patronage in his treatment of Berg and VÃ©ra. After
 26066	BorÃ­s came a lady with the colonel, then the general himself, then the
 26067	RostÃ³vs, and the party became unquestionably exactly like all other
 26068	evening parties. Berg and VÃ©ra could not repress their smiles of
 26069	satisfaction at the sight of all this movement in their drawing room,
 26070	at the sound of the disconnected talk, the rustling of dresses, and the
 26071	bowing and scraping. Everything was just as everybody always has it,
 26072	especially so the general, who admired the apartment, patted Berg on the
 26073	shoulder, and with parental authority superintended the setting out of
 26074	the table for boston. The general sat down by Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v, who
 26075	was next to himself the most important guest. The old people sat with
 26076	the old, the young with the young, and the hostess at the tea table, on
 26077	which stood exactly the same kind of cakes in a silver cake basket as
 26078	the Panins had at their party. Everything was just as it was everywhere
 26079	else.
 26080	
 26081	
 26082	
 26083	
 26084	
 26085	CHAPTER XXI
 26086	
 26087	Pierre, as one of the principal guests, had to sit down to boston
 26088	with Count RostÃ³v, the general, and the colonel. At the card table he
 26089	happened to be directly facing NatÃ¡sha, and was struck by a curious
 26090	change that had come over her since the ball. She was silent, and not
 26091	only less pretty than at the ball, but only redeemed from plainness by
 26092	her look of gentle indifference to everything around.
 26093	
 26094	âWhatâs the matter with her?â thought Pierre, glancing at her.
 26095	She was sitting by her sister at the tea table, and reluctantly, without
 26096	looking at him, made some reply to BorÃ­s who sat down beside her. After
 26097	playing out a whole suit and to his partnerâs delight taking five
 26098	tricks, Pierre, hearing greetings and the steps of someone who had
 26099	entered the room while he was picking up his tricks, glanced again at
 26100	NatÃ¡sha.
 26101	
 26102	âWhat has happened to her?â he asked himself with still greater
 26103	surprise.
 26104	
 26105	Prince Andrew was standing before her, saying something to her with a
 26106	look of tender solicitude. She, having raised her head, was looking up
 26107	at him, flushed and evidently trying to master her rapid breathing. And
 26108	the bright glow of some inner fire that had been suppressed was again
 26109	alight in her. She was completely transformed and from a plain girl had
 26110	again become what she had been at the ball.
 26111	
 26112	Prince Andrew went up to Pierre, and the latter noticed a new and
 26113	youthful expression in his friendâs face.
 26114	
 26115	Pierre changed places several times during the game, sitting now with
 26116	his back to NatÃ¡sha and now facing her, but during the whole of the six
 26117	rubbers he watched her and his friend.
 26118	
 26119	âSomething very important is happening between them,â thought
 26120	Pierre, and a feeling that was both joyful and painful agitated him and
 26121	made him neglect the game.
 26122	
 26123	After six rubbers the general got up, saying that it was no use playing
 26124	like that, and Pierre was released. NatÃ¡sha on one side was talking
 26125	with SÃ³nya and BorÃ­s, and VÃ©ra with a subtle smile was saying
 26126	something to Prince Andrew. Pierre went up to his friend and, asking
 26127	whether they were talking secrets, sat down beside them. VÃ©ra, having
 26128	noticed Prince Andrewâs attentions to NatÃ¡sha, decided that at a
 26129	party, a real evening party, subtle allusions to the tender passion were
 26130	absolutely necessary and, seizing a moment when Prince Andrew was alone,
 26131	began a conversation with him about feelings in general and about her
 26132	sister. With so intellectual a guest as she considered Prince Andrew to
 26133	be, she felt that she had to employ her diplomatic tact.
 26134	
 26135	When Pierre went up to them he noticed that VÃ©ra was being carried away
 26136	by her self-satisfied talk, but that Prince Andrew seemed embarrassed, a
 26137	thing that rarely happened with him.
 26138	
 26139	âWhat do you think?â VÃ©ra was saying with an arch smile. âYou are
 26140	so discerning, Prince, and understand peopleâs characters so well at
 26141	a glance. What do you think of Natalie? Could she be constant in her
 26142	attachments? Could she, like other womenâ (VÃ©ra meant herself),
 26143	âlove a man once for all and remain true to him forever? That is what
 26144	I consider true love. What do you think, Prince?â
 26145	
 26146	âI know your sister too little,â replied Prince Andrew, with a
 26147	sarcastic smile under which he wished to hide his embarrassment, âto
 26148	be able to solve so delicate a question, and then I have noticed that
 26149	the less attractive a woman is the more constant she is likely to be,â
 26150	he added, and looked up at Pierre who was just approaching them.
 26151	
 26152	âYes, that is true, Prince. In our days,â continued
 26153	VÃ©raâmentioning âour daysâ as people of limited intelligence are
 26154	fond of doing, imagining that they have discovered and appraised the
 26155	peculiarities of âour daysâ and that human characteristics change
 26156	with the timesââin our days a girl has so much freedom that the
 26157	pleasure of being courted often stifles real feeling in her. And it must
 26158	be confessed that Natalie is very susceptible.â This return to
 26159	the subject of Natalie caused Prince Andrew to knit his brows with
 26160	discomfort: he was about to rise, but VÃ©ra continued with a still more
 26161	subtle smile:
 26162	
 26163	âI think no one has been more courted than she,â she went on, âbut
 26164	till quite lately she never cared seriously for anyone. Now you know,
 26165	Count,â she said to Pierre, âeven our dear cousin BorÃ­s, who,
 26166	between ourselves, was very far gone in the land of tenderness...â
 26167	(alluding to a map of love much in vogue at that time).
 26168	
 26169	Prince Andrew frowned and remained silent.
 26170	
 26171	âYou are friendly with BorÃ­s, arenât you?â asked VÃ©ra.
 26172	
 26173	âYes, I know him....â
 26174	
 26175	âI expect he has told you of his childish love for NatÃ¡sha?â
 26176	
 26177	âOh, there was childish love?â suddenly asked Prince Andrew,
 26178	blushing unexpectedly.
 26179	
 26180	âYes, you know between cousins intimacy often leads to love. Le
 26181	cousinage est un dangereux voisinage. * Donât you think so?â
 26182	
 26183	    * âCousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood.â
 26184	
 26185	
 26186	âOh, undoubtedly!â said Prince Andrew, and with sudden and unnatural
 26187	liveliness he began chaffing Pierre about the need to be very careful
 26188	with his fifty-year-old Moscow cousins, and in the midst of these
 26189	jesting remarks he rose, taking Pierre by the arm, and drew him aside.
 26190	
 26191	âWell?â asked Pierre, seeing his friendâs strange animation with
 26192	surprise, and noticing the glance he turned on NatÃ¡sha as he rose.
 26193	
 26194	âI must... I must have a talk with you,â said Prince Andrew. âYou
 26195	know that pair of womenâs gloves?â (He referred to the Masonic
 26196	gloves given to a newly initiated Brother to present to the woman he
 26197	loved.) âI... but no, I will talk to you later on,â and with a
 26198	strange light in his eyes and restlessness in his movements, Prince
 26199	Andrew approached NatÃ¡sha and sat down beside her. Pierre saw how
 26200	Prince Andrew asked her something and how she flushed as she replied.
 26201	
 26202	But at that moment Berg came to Pierre and began insisting that he
 26203	should take part in an argument between the general and the colonel on
 26204	the affairs in Spain.
 26205	
 26206	Berg was satisfied and happy. The smile of pleasure never left his face.
 26207	The party was very successful and quite like other parties he had
 26208	seen. Everything was similar: the ladiesâ subtle talk, the cards, the
 26209	general raising his voice at the card table, and the samovar and the tea
 26210	cakes; only one thing was lacking that he had always seen at the evening
 26211	parties he wished to imitate. They had not yet had a loud conversation
 26212	among the men and a dispute about something important and clever. Now
 26213	the general had begun such a discussion and so Berg drew Pierre to it.
 26214	
 26215	
 26216	
 26217	
 26218	
 26219	CHAPTER XXII
 26220	
 26221	Next day, having been invited by the count, Prince Andrew dined with the
 26222	RostÃ³vs and spent the rest of the day there.
 26223	
 26224	Everyone in the house realized for whose sake Prince Andrew came, and
 26225	without concealing it he tried to be with NatÃ¡sha all day. Not only in
 26226	the soul of the frightened yet happy and enraptured NatÃ¡sha, but in the
 26227	whole house, there was a feeling of awe at something important that was
 26228	bound to happen. The countess looked with sad and sternly serious eyes
 26229	at Prince Andrew when he talked to NatÃ¡sha and timidly started some
 26230	artificial conversation about trifles as soon as he looked her way.
 26231	SÃ³nya was afraid to leave NatÃ¡sha and afraid of being in the way when
 26232	she was with them. NatÃ¡sha grew pale, in a panic of expectation, when
 26233	she remained alone with him for a moment. Prince Andrew surprised her by
 26234	his timidity. She felt that he wanted to say something to her but could
 26235	not bring himself to do so.
 26236	
 26237	In the evening, when Prince Andrew had left, the countess went up to
 26238	NatÃ¡sha and whispered: âWell, what?â
 26239	
 26240	âMamma! For heavenâs sake donât ask me anything now! One canât
 26241	talk about that,â said NatÃ¡sha.
 26242	
 26243	But all the same that night NatÃ¡sha, now agitated and now frightened,
 26244	lay a long time in her motherâs bed gazing straight before her. She
 26245	told her how he had complimented her, how he told her he was going
 26246	abroad, asked her where they were going to spend the summer, and then
 26247	how he had asked her about BorÃ­s.
 26248	
 26249	âBut such a... such a... never happened to me before!â she said.
 26250	âOnly I feel afraid in his presence. I am always afraid when Iâm
 26251	with him. What does that mean? Does it mean that itâs the real thing?
 26252	Yes? Mamma, are you asleep?â
 26253	
 26254	âNo, my love; I am frightened myself,â answered her mother. âNow
 26255	go!â
 26256	
 26257	âAll the same I shanât sleep. What silliness, to sleep! Mummy!
 26258	Mummy! such a thing never happened to me before,â she said, surprised
 26259	and alarmed at the feeling she was aware of in herself. âAnd could we
 26260	ever have thought!...â
 26261	
 26262	It seemed to NatÃ¡sha that even at the time she first saw Prince Andrew
 26263	at OtrÃ¡dnoe she had fallen in love with him. It was as if she feared
 26264	this strange, unexpected happiness of meeting again the very man she had
 26265	then chosen (she was firmly convinced she had done so) and of finding
 26266	him, as it seemed, not indifferent to her.
 26267	
 26268	âAnd it had to happen that he should come specially to Petersburg
 26269	while we are here. And it had to happen that we should meet at that
 26270	ball. It is fate. Clearly it is fate that everything led up to this!
 26271	Already then, directly I saw him I felt something peculiar.â
 26272	
 26273	âWhat else did he say to you? What are those verses? Read them...â
 26274	said her mother, thoughtfully, referring to some verses Prince Andrew
 26275	had written in NatÃ¡shaâs album.
 26276	
 26277	âMamma, one need not be ashamed of his being a widower?â
 26278	
 26279	âDonât, NatÃ¡sha! Pray to God. âMarriages are made in
 26280	heaven,ââ said her mother.
 26281	
 26282	âDarling Mummy, how I love you! How happy I am!â cried NatÃ¡sha,
 26283	shedding tears of joy and excitement and embracing her mother.
 26284	
 26285	At that very time Prince Andrew was sitting with Pierre and telling him
 26286	of his love for NatÃ¡sha and his firm resolve to make her his wife.
 26287	
 26288	That day Countess HÃ©lÃ¨ne had a reception at her house. The French
 26289	ambassador was there, and a foreign prince of the blood who had of
 26290	late become a frequent visitor of hers, and many brilliant ladies and
 26291	gentlemen. Pierre, who had come downstairs, walked through the rooms and
 26292	struck everyone by his preoccupied, absent-minded, and morose air.
 26293	
 26294	Since the ball he had felt the approach of a fit of nervous depression
 26295	and had made desperate efforts to combat it. Since the intimacy of
 26296	his wife with the royal prince, Pierre had unexpectedly been made a
 26297	gentleman of the bedchamber, and from that time he had begun to feel
 26298	oppressed and ashamed in court society, and dark thoughts of the vanity
 26299	of all things human came to him oftener than before. At the same time
 26300	the feeling he had noticed between his protÃ©gÃ©e NatÃ¡sha and Prince
 26301	Andrew accentuated his gloom by the contrast between his own position
 26302	and his friendâs. He tried equally to avoid thinking about his wife,
 26303	and about NatÃ¡sha and Prince Andrew; and again everything seemed to him
 26304	insignificant in comparison with eternity; again the question: for what?
 26305	presented itself; and he forced himself to work day and night at Masonic
 26306	labors, hoping to drive away the evil spirit that threatened him. Toward
 26307	midnight, after he had left the countessâ apartments, he was sitting
 26308	upstairs in a shabby dressing gown, copying out the original transaction
 26309	of the Scottish lodge of Freemasons at a table in his low room cloudy
 26310	with tobacco smoke, when someone came in. It was Prince Andrew.
 26311	
 26312	âAh, itâs you!â said Pierre with a preoccupied, dissatisfied air.
 26313	âAnd I, you see, am hard at it.â He pointed to his manuscript book
 26314	with that air of escaping from the ills of life with which unhappy
 26315	people look at their work.
 26316	
 26317	Prince Andrew, with a beaming, ecstatic expression of renewed life on
 26318	his face, paused in front of Pierre and, not noticing his sad look,
 26319	smiled at him with the egotism of joy.
 26320	
 26321	âWell, dear heart,â said he, âI wanted to tell you about it
 26322	yesterday and I have come to do so today. I never experienced anything
 26323	like it before. I am in love, my friend!â
 26324	
 26325	Suddenly Pierre heaved a deep sigh and dumped his heavy person down on
 26326	the sofa beside Prince Andrew.
 26327	
 26328	âWith NatÃ¡sha RostÃ³va, yes?â said he.
 26329	
 26330	âYes, yes! Who else should it be? I should never have believed it,
 26331	but the feeling is stronger than I. Yesterday I tormented myself and
 26332	suffered, but I would not exchange even that torment for anything in
 26333	the world, I have not lived till now. At last I live, but I canât
 26334	live without her! But can she love me?... I am too old for her.... Why
 26335	donât you speak?â
 26336	
 26337	âI? I? What did I tell you?â said Pierre suddenly, rising and
 26338	beginning to pace up and down the room. âI always thought it.... That
 26339	girl is such a treasure... she is a rare girl.... My dear friend,
 26340	I entreat you, donât philosophize, donât doubt, marry, marry,
 26341	marry.... And I am sure there will not be a happier man than you.â
 26342	
 26343	âBut what of her?â
 26344	
 26345	âShe loves you.â
 26346	
 26347	âDonât talk rubbish...â said Prince Andrew, smiling and looking
 26348	into Pierreâs eyes.
 26349	
 26350	âShe does, I know,â Pierre cried fiercely.
 26351	
 26352	âBut do listen,â returned Prince Andrew, holding him by the
 26353	arm. âDo you know the condition I am in? I must talk about it to
 26354	someone.â
 26355	
 26356	âWell, go on, go on. I am very glad,â said Pierre, and his face
 26357	really changed, his brow became smooth, and he listened gladly to Prince
 26358	Andrew. Prince Andrew seemed, and really was, quite a different, quite
 26359	a new man. Where was his spleen, his contempt for life, his
 26360	disillusionment? Pierre was the only person to whom he made up his mind
 26361	to speak openly; and to him he told all that was in his soul. Now he
 26362	boldly and lightly made plans for an extended future, said he could not
 26363	sacrifice his own happiness to his fatherâs caprice, and spoke of how
 26364	he would either make his father consent to this marriage and love her,
 26365	or would do without his consent; then he marveled at the feeling that
 26366	had mastered him as at something strange, apart from and independent of
 26367	himself.
 26368	
 26369	âI should not have believed anyone who told me that I was capable of
 26370	such love,â said Prince Andrew. âIt is not at all the same feeling
 26371	that I knew in the past. The whole world is now for me divided into two
 26372	halves: one half is she, and there all is joy, hope, light: the
 26373	other half is everything where she is not, and there is all gloom and
 26374	darkness....â
 26375	
 26376	âDarkness and gloom,â reiterated Pierre: âyes, yes, I understand
 26377	that.â
 26378	
 26379	âI cannot help loving the light, it is not my fault. And I am very
 26380	happy! You understand me? I know you are glad for my sake.â
 26381	
 26382	âYes, yes,â Pierre assented, looking at his friend with a touched
 26383	and sad expression in his eyes. The brighter Prince Andrewâs lot
 26384	appeared to him, the gloomier seemed his own.
 26385	
 26386	
 26387	
 26388	
 26389	
 26390	CHAPTER XXIII
 26391	
 26392	Prince Andrew needed his fatherâs consent to his marriage, and to
 26393	obtain this he started for the country next day.
 26394	
 26395	His father received his sonâs communication with external composure,
 26396	but inward wrath. He could not comprehend how anyone could wish to
 26397	alter his life or introduce anything new into it, when his own life
 26398	was already ending. âIf only they would let me end my days as I want
 26399	to,â thought the old man, âthen they might do as they please.â
 26400	With his son, however, he employed the diplomacy he reserved for
 26401	important occasions and, adopting a quiet tone, discussed the whole
 26402	matter.
 26403	
 26404	In the first place the marriage was not a brilliant one as regards
 26405	birth, wealth, or rank. Secondly, Prince Andrew was no longer as young
 26406	as he had been and his health was poor (the old man laid special stress
 26407	on this), while she was very young. Thirdly, he had a son whom it would
 26408	be a pity to entrust to a chit of a girl. âFourthly and finally,â
 26409	the father said, looking ironically at his son, âI beg you to put it
 26410	off for a year: go abroad, take a cure, look out as you wanted to for
 26411	a German tutor for Prince Nicholas. Then if your love or passion or
 26412	obstinacyâas you pleaseâis still as great, marry! And thatâs my
 26413	last word on it. Mind, the last...â concluded the prince, in a tone
 26414	which showed that nothing would make him alter his decision.
 26415	
 26416	Prince Andrew saw clearly that the old man hoped that his feelings, or
 26417	his fiancÃ©eâs, would not stand a yearâs test, or that he (the old
 26418	prince himself) would die before then, and he decided to conform to his
 26419	fatherâs wishâto propose, and postpone the wedding for a year.
 26420	
 26421	Three weeks after the last evening he had spent with the RostÃ³vs,
 26422	Prince Andrew returned to Petersburg.
 26423	
 26424	
 26425	Next day after her talk with her mother NatÃ¡sha expected BolkÃ³nski all
 26426	day, but he did not come. On the second and third day it was the same.
 26427	Pierre did not come either and NatÃ¡sha, not knowing that Prince Andrew
 26428	had gone to see his father, could not explain his absence to herself.
 26429	
 26430	Three weeks passed in this way. NatÃ¡sha had no desire to go out
 26431	anywhere and wandered from room to room like a shadow, idle and
 26432	listless; she wept secretly at night and did not go to her mother in the
 26433	evenings. She blushed continually and was irritable. It seemed to her
 26434	that everybody knew about her disappointment and was laughing at her and
 26435	pitying her. Strong as was her inward grief, this wound to her vanity
 26436	intensified her misery.
 26437	
 26438	Once she came to her mother, tried to say something, and suddenly began
 26439	to cry. Her tears were those of an offended child who does not know why
 26440	it is being punished.
 26441	
 26442	The countess began to soothe NatÃ¡sha, who after first listening to her
 26443	motherâs words, suddenly interrupted her:
 26444	
 26445	âLeave off, Mamma! I donât think, and donât want to think about
 26446	it! He just came and then left off, left off....â
 26447	
 26448	Her voice trembled, and she again nearly cried, but recovered and went
 26449	on quietly:
 26450	
 26451	âAnd I donât at all want to get married. And I am afraid of him; I
 26452	have now become quite calm, quite calm.â
 26453	
 26454	The day after this conversation NatÃ¡sha put on the old dress which
 26455	she knew had the peculiar property of conducing to cheerfulness in the
 26456	mornings, and that day she returned to the old way of life which she had
 26457	abandoned since the ball. Having finished her morning tea she went to
 26458	the ballroom, which she particularly liked for its loud resonance, and
 26459	began singing her solfeggio. When she had finished her first exercise
 26460	she stood still in the middle of the room and sang a musical phrase that
 26461	particularly pleased her. She listened joyfully (as though she had not
 26462	expected it) to the charm of the notes reverberating, filling the
 26463	whole empty ballroom, and slowly dying away; and all at once she felt
 26464	cheerful. âWhatâs the good of making so much of it? Things are nice
 26465	as it is,â she said to herself, and she began walking up and down the
 26466	room, not stepping simply on the resounding parquet but treading with
 26467	each step from the heel to the toe (she had on a new and favorite pair
 26468	of shoes) and listening to the regular tap of the heel and creak of
 26469	the toe as gladly as she had to the sounds of her own voice. Passing a
 26470	mirror she glanced into it. âThere, thatâs me!â the expression of
 26471	her face seemed to say as she caught sight of herself. âWell, and very
 26472	nice too! I need nobody.â
 26473	
 26474	A footman wanted to come in to clear away something in the room but she
 26475	would not let him, and having closed the door behind him continued her
 26476	walk. That morning she had returned to her favorite moodâlove of,
 26477	and delight in, herself. âHow charming that NatÃ¡sha is!â she said
 26478	again, speaking as some third, collective, male person. âPretty,
 26479	a good voice, young, and in nobodyâs way if only they leave her in
 26480	peace.â But however much they left her in peace she could not now be
 26481	at peace, and immediately felt this.
 26482	
 26483	In the hall the porch door opened, and someone asked, âAt home?â and
 26484	then footsteps were heard. NatÃ¡sha was looking at the mirror, but did
 26485	not see herself. She listened to the sounds in the hall. When she saw
 26486	herself, her face was pale. It was he. She knew this for certain, though
 26487	she hardly heard his voice through the closed doors.
 26488	
 26489	Pale and agitated, NatÃ¡sha ran into the drawing room.
 26490	
 26491	âMamma! BolkÃ³nski has come!â she said. âMamma, it is awful, it is
 26492	unbearable! I donât want... to be tormented? What am I to do?...â
 26493	
 26494	Before the countess could answer, Prince Andrew entered the room with
 26495	an agitated and serious face. As soon as he saw NatÃ¡sha his face
 26496	brightened. He kissed the countessâ hand and NatÃ¡shaâs, and sat
 26497	down beside the sofa.
 26498	
 26499	âIt is long since we had the pleasure...â began the countess,
 26500	but Prince Andrew interrupted her by answering her intended question,
 26501	obviously in haste to say what he had to.
 26502	
 26503	âI have not been to see you all this time because I have been at my
 26504	fatherâs. I had to talk over a very important matter with him. I only
 26505	got back last night,â he said glancing at NatÃ¡sha; âI want to have
 26506	a talk with you, Countess,â he added after a momentâs pause.
 26507	
 26508	The countess lowered her eyes, sighing deeply.
 26509	
 26510	âI am at your disposal,â she murmured.
 26511	
 26512	NatÃ¡sha knew that she ought to go away, but was unable to do so:
 26513	something gripped her throat, and regardless of manners she stared
 26514	straight at Prince Andrew with wide-open eyes.
 26515	
 26516	âAt once? This instant!... No, it canât be!â she thought.
 26517	
 26518	Again he glanced at her, and that glance convinced her that she was not
 26519	mistaken. Yes, at once, that very instant, her fate would be decided.
 26520	
 26521	âGo, NatÃ¡sha! I will call you,â said the countess in a whisper.
 26522	
 26523	NatÃ¡sha glanced with frightened imploring eyes at Prince Andrew and at
 26524	her mother and went out.
 26525	
 26526	âI have come, Countess, to ask for your daughterâs hand,â said
 26527	Prince Andrew.
 26528	
 26529	The countessâ face flushed hotly, but she said nothing.
 26530	
 26531	âYour offer...â she began at last sedately. He remained silent,
 26532	looking into her eyes. âYour offer...â (she grew confused) âis
 26533	agreeable to us, and I accept your offer. I am glad. And my husband... I
 26534	hope... but it will depend on her....â
 26535	
 26536	âI will speak to her when I have your consent.... Do you give it to
 26537	me?â said Prince Andrew.
 26538	
 26539	âYes,â replied the countess. She held out her hand to him, and with
 26540	a mixed feeling of estrangement and tenderness pressed her lips to his
 26541	forehead as he stooped to kiss her hand. She wished to love him as a
 26542	son, but felt that to her he was a stranger and a terrifying man. âI
 26543	am sure my husband will consent,â said the countess, âbut your
 26544	father...â
 26545	
 26546	âMy father, to whom I have told my plans, has made it an express
 26547	condition of his consent that the wedding is not to take place for a
 26548	year. And I wished to tell you of that,â said Prince Andrew.
 26549	
 26550	âIt is true that NatÃ¡sha is still young, butâso long as that?...â
 26551	
 26552	âIt is unavoidable,â said Prince Andrew with a sigh.
 26553	
 26554	âI will send her to you,â said the countess, and left the room.
 26555	
 26556	âLord have mercy upon us!â she repeated while seeking her daughter.
 26557	
 26558	SÃ³nya said that NatÃ¡sha was in her bedroom. NatÃ¡sha was sitting on
 26559	the bed, pale and dry-eyed, and was gazing at the icons and whispering
 26560	something as she rapidly crossed herself. Seeing her mother she jumped
 26561	up and flew to her.
 26562	
 26563	âWell, Mamma?... Well?...â
 26564	
 26565	âGo, go to him. He is asking for your hand,â said the countess,
 26566	coldly it seemed to NatÃ¡sha. âGo... go,â said the mother, sadly and
 26567	reproachfully, with a deep sigh, as her daughter ran away.
 26568	
 26569	NatÃ¡sha never remembered how she entered the drawing room. When she
 26570	came in and saw him she paused. âIs it possible that this stranger
 26571	has now become everything to me?â she asked herself, and immediately
 26572	answered, âYes, everything! He alone is now dearer to me than
 26573	everything in the world.â Prince Andrew came up to her with downcast
 26574	eyes.
 26575	
 26576	âI have loved you from the very first moment I saw you. May I hope?â
 26577	
 26578	He looked at her and was struck by the serious impassioned expression of
 26579	her face. Her face said: âWhy ask? Why doubt what you cannot but know?
 26580	Why speak, when words cannot express what one feels?â
 26581	
 26582	She drew near to him and stopped. He took her hand and kissed it.
 26583	
 26584	âDo you love me?â
 26585	
 26586	âYes, yes!â NatÃ¡sha murmured as if in vexation. Then she sighed
 26587	loudly and, catching her breath more and more quickly, began to sob.
 26588	
 26589	âWhat is it? Whatâs the matter?â
 26590	
 26591	âOh, I am so happy!â she replied, smiled through her tears, bent
 26592	over closer to him, paused for an instant as if asking herself whether
 26593	she might, and then kissed him.
 26594	
 26595	Prince Andrew held her hands, looked into her eyes, and did not find
 26596	in his heart his former love for her. Something in him had suddenly
 26597	changed; there was no longer the former poetic and mystic charm of
 26598	desire, but there was pity for her feminine and childish weakness, fear
 26599	at her devotion and trustfulness, and an oppressive yet joyful sense of
 26600	the duty that now bound him to her forever. The present feeling, though
 26601	not so bright and poetic as the former, was stronger and more serious.
 26602	
 26603	âDid your mother tell you that it cannot be for a year?â asked
 26604	Prince Andrew, still looking into her eyes.
 26605	
 26606	âIs it possible that Iâthe âchit of a girl,â as everybody called
 26607	me,â thought NatÃ¡shaââis it possible that I am now to be the
 26608	wife and the equal of this strange, dear, clever man whom even my father
 26609	looks up to? Can it be true? Can it be true that there can be no
 26610	more playing with life, that now I am grown up, that on me now lies
 26611	a responsibility for my every word and deed? Yes, but what did he ask
 26612	me?â
 26613	
 26614	âNo,â she replied, but she had not understood his question.
 26615	
 26616	âForgive me!â he said. âBut you are so young, and I have already
 26617	been through so much in life. I am afraid for you, you do not yet know
 26618	yourself.â
 26619	
 26620	NatÃ¡sha listened with concentrated attention, trying but failing to
 26621	take in the meaning of his words.
 26622	
 26623	âHard as this year which delays my happiness will be,â continued
 26624	Prince Andrew, âit will give you time to be sure of yourself. I ask
 26625	you to make me happy in a year, but you are free: our engagement shall
 26626	remain a secret, and should you find that you do not love me, or should
 26627	you come to love...â said Prince Andrew with an unnatural smile.
 26628	
 26629	âWhy do you say that?â NatÃ¡sha interrupted him. âYou know that
 26630	from the very day you first came to OtrÃ¡dnoe I have loved you,â she
 26631	cried, quite convinced that she spoke the truth.
 26632	
 26633	âIn a year you will learn to know yourself....â
 26634	
 26635	âA whole year!â NatÃ¡sha repeated suddenly, only now realizing that
 26636	the marriage was to be postponed for a year. âBut why a year? Why a
 26637	year?...â
 26638	
 26639	Prince Andrew began to explain to her the reasons for this delay.
 26640	NatÃ¡sha did not hear him.
 26641	
 26642	âAnd canât it be helped?â she asked. Prince Andrew did not reply,
 26643	but his face expressed the impossibility of altering that decision.
 26644	
 26645	âItâs awful! Oh, itâs awful! awful!â NatÃ¡sha suddenly cried,
 26646	and again burst into sobs. âI shall die, waiting a year: itâs
 26647	impossible, itâs awful!â She looked into her loverâs face and saw
 26648	in it a look of commiseration and perplexity.
 26649	
 26650	âNo, no! Iâll do anything!â she said, suddenly checking her tears.
 26651	âI am so happy.â
 26652	
 26653	The father and mother came into the room and gave the betrothed couple
 26654	their blessing.
 26655	
 26656	From that day Prince Andrew began to frequent the RostÃ³vsâ as
 26657	NatÃ¡shaâs affianced lover.
 26658	
 26659	
 26660	
 26661	
 26662	
 26663	CHAPTER XXIV
 26664	
 26665	No betrothal ceremony took place and NatÃ¡shaâs engagement to
 26666	BolkÃ³nski was not announced; Prince Andrew insisted on that. He said
 26667	that as he was responsible for the delay he ought to bear the whole
 26668	burden of it; that he had given his word and bound himself forever, but
 26669	that he did not wish to bind NatÃ¡sha and gave her perfect freedom. If
 26670	after six months she felt that she did not love him she would have full
 26671	right to reject him. Naturally neither NatÃ¡sha nor her parents wished
 26672	to hear of this, but Prince Andrew was firm. He came every day to the
 26673	RostÃ³vsâ, but did not behave to NatÃ¡sha as an affianced lover: he
 26674	did not use the familiar thou, but said you to her, and kissed only her
 26675	hand. After their engagement, quite different, intimate, and natural
 26676	relations sprang up between them. It was as if they had not known each
 26677	other till now. Both liked to recall how they had regarded each other
 26678	when as yet they were nothing to one another; they felt themselves
 26679	now quite different beings: then they were artificial, now natural and
 26680	sincere. At first the family felt some constraint in intercourse with
 26681	Prince Andrew; he seemed a man from another world, and for a long time
 26682	NatÃ¡sha trained the family to get used to him, proudly assuring them
 26683	all that he only appeared to be different, but was really just like all
 26684	of them, and that she was not afraid of him and no one else ought to be.
 26685	After a few days they grew accustomed to him, and without restraint in
 26686	his presence pursued their usual way of life, in which he took his part.
 26687	He could talk about rural economy with the count, fashions with the
 26688	countess and NatÃ¡sha, and about albums and fancywork with SÃ³nya.
 26689	Sometimes the household both among themselves and in his presence
 26690	expressed their wonder at how it had all happened, and at the evident
 26691	omens there had been of it: Prince Andrewâs coming to OtrÃ¡dnoe and
 26692	their coming to Petersburg, and the likeness between NatÃ¡sha and Prince
 26693	Andrew which her nurse had noticed on his first visit, and Andrewâs
 26694	encounter with Nicholas in 1805, and many other incidents betokening
 26695	that it had to be.
 26696	
 26697	In the house that poetic dullness and quiet reigned which always
 26698	accompanies the presence of a betrothed couple. Often when all sitting
 26699	together everyone kept silent. Sometimes the others would get up and
 26700	go away and the couple, left alone, still remained silent. They rarely
 26701	spoke of their future life. Prince Andrew was afraid and ashamed to
 26702	speak of it. NatÃ¡sha shared this as she did all his feelings, which she
 26703	constantly divined. Once she began questioning him about his son. Prince
 26704	Andrew blushed, as he often did nowâNatÃ¡sha particularly liked it in
 26705	himâand said that his son would not live with them.
 26706	
 26707	âWhy not?â asked NatÃ¡sha in a frightened tone.
 26708	
 26709	âI cannot take him away from his grandfather, and besides...â
 26710	
 26711	âHow I should have loved him!â said NatÃ¡sha, immediately guessing
 26712	his thought; âbut I know you wish to avoid any pretext for finding
 26713	fault with us.â
 26714	
 26715	Sometimes the old count would come up, kiss Prince Andrew, and ask
 26716	his advice about PÃ©tyaâs education or Nicholasâ service. The
 26717	old countess sighed as she looked at them; SÃ³nya was always getting
 26718	frightened lest she should be in the way and tried to find excuses for
 26719	leaving them alone, even when they did not wish it. When Prince Andrew
 26720	spoke (he could tell a story very well), NatÃ¡sha listened to him
 26721	with pride; when she spoke she noticed with fear and joy that he gazed
 26722	attentively and scrutinizingly at her. She asked herself in perplexity:
 26723	âWhat does he look for in me? He is trying to discover something by
 26724	looking at me! What if what he seeks in me is not there?â Sometimes
 26725	she fell into one of the mad, merry moods characteristic of her, and
 26726	then she particularly loved to hear and see how Prince Andrew laughed.
 26727	He seldom laughed, but when he did he abandoned himself entirely to his
 26728	laughter, and after such a laugh she always felt nearer to him. NatÃ¡sha
 26729	would have been completely happy if the thought of the separation
 26730	awaiting her and drawing near had not terrified her, just as the mere
 26731	thought of it made him turn pale and cold.
 26732	
 26733	On the eve of his departure from Petersburg Prince Andrew brought with
 26734	him Pierre, who had not been to the RostÃ³vsâ once since the ball.
 26735	Pierre seemed disconcerted and embarrassed. He was talking to the
 26736	countess, and NatÃ¡sha sat down beside a little chess table with SÃ³nya,
 26737	thereby inviting Prince Andrew to come too. He did so.
 26738	
 26739	âYou have known BezÃºkhov a long time?â he asked. âDo you like
 26740	him?â
 26741	
 26742	âYes, heâs a dear, but very absurd.â
 26743	
 26744	And as usual when speaking of Pierre, she began to tell anecdotes of his
 26745	absent-mindedness, some of which had even been invented about him.
 26746	
 26747	âDo you know I have entrusted him with our secret? I have known him
 26748	from childhood. He has a heart of gold. I beg you, Natalie,â Prince
 26749	Andrew said with sudden seriousnessââI am going away and heaven
 26750	knows what may happen. You may cease to... all right, I know I am not
 26751	to say that. Only this, then: whatever may happen to you when I am not
 26752	here...â
 26753	
 26754	âWhat can happen?â
 26755	
 26756	âWhatever trouble may come,â Prince Andrew continued, âI beg
 26757	you, Mademoiselle Sophie, whatever may happen, to turn to him alone for
 26758	advice and help! He is a most absent-minded and absurd fellow, but he
 26759	has a heart of gold.â
 26760	
 26761	Neither her father, nor her mother, nor SÃ³nya, nor Prince Andrew
 26762	himself could have foreseen how the separation from her lover would act
 26763	on NatÃ¡sha. Flushed and agitated she went about the house all that day,
 26764	dry-eyed, occupied with most trivial matters as if not understanding
 26765	what awaited her. She did not even cry when, on taking leave, he kissed
 26766	her hand for the last time. âDonât go!â she said in a tone
 26767	that made him wonder whether he really ought not to stay and which he
 26768	remembered long afterwards. Nor did she cry when he was gone; but
 26769	for several days she sat in her room dry-eyed, taking no interest in
 26770	anything and only saying now and then, âOh, why did he go away?â
 26771	
 26772	But a fortnight after his departure, to the surprise of those around
 26773	her, she recovered from her mental sickness just as suddenly and became
 26774	her old self again, but with a change in her moral physiognomy, as a
 26775	child gets up after a long illness with a changed expression of face.

 26781	CHAPTER XXV
 26782	
 26783	During that year after his sonâs departure, Prince Nicholas
 26784	BolkÃ³nskiâs health and temper became much worse. He grew still more
 26785	irritable, and it was Princess Mary who generally bore the brunt of his
 26786	frequent fits of unprovoked anger. He seemed carefully to seek out
 26787	her tender spots so as to torture her mentally as harshly as possible.
 26788	Princess Mary had two passions and consequently two joysâher nephew,
 26789	little Nicholas, and religionâand these were the favorite subjects
 26790	of the princeâs attacks and ridicule. Whatever was spoken of he would
 26791	bring round to the superstitiousness of old maids, or the petting
 26792	and spoiling of children. âYou want to make himââlittle
 26793	Nicholasââinto an old maid like yourself! A pity! Prince Andrew
 26794	wants a son and not an old maid,â he would say. Or, turning to
 26795	Mademoiselle Bourienne, he would ask her in Princess Maryâs presence
 26796	how she liked our village priests and icons and would joke about them.
 26797	
 26798	He continually hurt Princess Maryâs feelings and tormented her, but it
 26799	cost her no effort to forgive him. Could he be to blame toward her, or
 26800	could her father, whom she knew loved her in spite of it all, be unjust?
 26801	And what is justice? The princess never thought of that proud word
 26802	âjustice.â All the complex laws of man centered for her in one clear
 26803	and simple lawâthe law of love and self-sacrifice taught us by Him who
 26804	lovingly suffered for mankind though He Himself was God. What had she to
 26805	do with the justice or injustice of other people? She had to endure and
 26806	love, and that she did.
 26807	
 26808	During the winter Prince Andrew had come to Bald Hills and had been gay,
 26809	gentle, and more affectionate than Princess Mary had known him for a
 26810	long time past. She felt that something had happened to him, but he said
 26811	nothing to her about his love. Before he left he had a long talk with
 26812	his father about something, and Princess Mary noticed that before his
 26813	departure they were dissatisfied with one another.
 26814	
 26815	Soon after Prince Andrew had gone, Princess Mary wrote to her friend
 26816	Julie KarÃ¡gina in Petersburg, whom she had dreamed (as all girls dream)
 26817	of marrying to her brother, and who was at that time in mourning for her
 26818	own brother, killed in Turkey.
 26819	
 26820	Sorrow, it seems, is our common lot, my dear, tender friend Julie.
 26821	
 26822	Your loss is so terrible that I can only explain it to myself as a
 26823	special providence of God who, loving you, wishes to try you and your
 26824	excellent mother. Oh, my friend! Religion, and religion alone, canâI
 26825	will not say comfort usâbut save us from despair. Religion alone can
 26826	explain to us what without its help man cannot comprehend: why, for what
 26827	cause, kind and noble beings able to find happiness in lifeânot merely
 26828	harming no one but necessary to the happiness of othersâare called
 26829	away to God, while cruel, useless, harmful persons, or such as are a
 26830	burden to themselves and to others, are left living. The first death I
 26831	saw, and one I shall never forgetâthat of my dear sister-in-lawâleft
 26832	that impression on me. Just as you ask destiny why your splendid brother
 26833	had to die, so I asked why that angel Lise, who not only never wronged
 26834	anyone, but in whose soul there were never any unkind thoughts, had to
 26835	die. And what do you think, dear friend? Five years have passed since
 26836	then, and already I, with my petty understanding, begin to see clearly
 26837	why she had to die, and in what way that death was but an expression
 26838	of the infinite goodness of the Creator, whose every action, though
 26839	generally incomprehensible to us, is but a manifestation of His infinite
 26840	love for His creatures. Perhaps, I often think, she was too angelically
 26841	innocent to have the strength to perform all a motherâs duties. As a
 26842	young wife she was irreproachable; perhaps she could not have been so
 26843	as a mother. As it is, not only has she left us, and particularly Prince
 26844	Andrew, with the purest regrets and memories, but probably she will
 26845	there receive a place I dare not hope for myself. But not to speak of
 26846	her alone, that early and terrible death has had the most beneficent
 26847	influence on me and on my brother in spite of all our grief. Then, at
 26848	the moment of our loss, these thoughts could not occur to me; I should
 26849	then have dismissed them with horror, but now they are very clear and
 26850	certain. I write all this to you, dear friend, only to convince you
 26851	of the Gospel truth which has become for me a principle of life: not
 26852	a single hair of our heads will fall without His will. And His will is
 26853	governed only by infinite love for us, and so whatever befalls us is for
 26854	our good.
 26855	
 26856	You ask whether we shall spend next winter in Moscow. In spite of my
 26857	wish to see you, I do not think so and do not want to do so. You will
 26858	be surprised to hear that the reason for this is Buonaparte! The case is
 26859	this: my fatherâs health is growing noticeably worse, he cannot stand
 26860	any contradiction and is becoming irritable. This irritability is, as
 26861	you know, chiefly directed to political questions. He cannot endure
 26862	the notion that Buonaparte is negotiating on equal terms with all the
 26863	sovereigns of Europe and particularly with our own, the grandson of the
 26864	Great Catherine! As you know, I am quite indifferent to politics, but
 26865	from my fatherâs remarks and his talks with Michael IvÃ¡novich I know
 26866	all that goes on in the world and especially about the honors conferred
 26867	on Buonaparte, who only at Bald Hills in the whole world, it seems, is
 26868	not accepted as a great man, still less as Emperor of France. And my
 26869	father cannot stand this. It seems to me that it is chiefly because of
 26870	his political views that my father is reluctant to speak of going to
 26871	Moscow; for he foresees the encounters that would result from his way
 26872	of expressing his views regardless of anybody. All the benefit he might
 26873	derive from a course of treatment he would lose as a result of the
 26874	disputes about Buonaparte which would be inevitable. In any case it will
 26875	be decided very shortly.
 26876	
 26877	Our family life goes on in the old way except for my brother Andrewâs
 26878	absence. He, as I wrote you before, has changed very much of late. After
 26879	his sorrow he only this year quite recovered his spirits. He has again
 26880	become as I used to know him when a child: kind, affectionate, with that
 26881	heart of gold to which I know no equal. He has realized, it seems to me,
 26882	that life is not over for him. But together with this mental change
 26883	he has grown physically much weaker. He has become thinner and more
 26884	nervous. I am anxious about him and glad he is taking this trip abroad
 26885	which the doctors recommended long ago. I hope it will cure him. You
 26886	write that in Petersburg he is spoken of as one of the most active,
 26887	cultivated, and capable of the young men. Forgive my vanity as a
 26888	relation, but I never doubted it. The good he has done to everybody
 26889	here, from his peasants up to the gentry, is incalculable. On his
 26890	arrival in Petersburg he received only his due. I always wonder at the
 26891	way rumors fly from Petersburg to Moscow, especially such false ones as
 26892	that you write aboutâI mean the report of my brotherâs betrothal to
 26893	the little RostÃ³va. I do not think my brother will ever marry again,
 26894	and certainly not her; and this is why: first, I know that though he
 26895	rarely speaks about the wife he has lost, the grief of that loss
 26896	has gone too deep in his heart for him ever to decide to give her a
 26897	successor and our little angel a stepmother. Secondly because, as far
 26898	as I know, that girl is not the kind of girl who could please Prince
 26899	Andrew. I do not think he would choose her for a wife, and frankly I do
 26900	not wish it. But I am running on too long and am at the end of my second
 26901	sheet. Good-by, my dear friend. May God keep you in His holy and mighty
 26902	care. My dear friend, Mademoiselle Bourienne, sends you kisses.

 26910	CHAPTER XXVI
 26911	
 26912	In the middle of the summer Princess Mary received an unexpected letter
 26913	from Prince Andrew in Switzerland in which he gave her strange and
 26914	surprising news. He informed her of his engagement to NatÃ¡sha RostÃ³va.
 26915	The whole letter breathed loving rapture for his betrothed and tender
 26916	and confiding affection for his sister. He wrote that he had never loved
 26917	as he did now and that only now did he understand and know what life
 26918	was. He asked his sister to forgive him for not having told her of his
 26919	resolve when he had last visited Bald Hills, though he had spoken of it
 26920	to his father. He had not done so for fear Princess Mary should ask her
 26921	father to give his consent, irritating him and having to bear the brunt
 26922	of his displeasure without attaining her object. âBesides,â he
 26923	wrote, âthe matter was not then so definitely settled as it is now.
 26924	My father then insisted on a delay of a year and now already six months,
 26925	half of that period, have passed, and my resolution is firmer than ever.
 26926	If the doctors did not keep me here at the spas I should be back in
 26927	Russia, but as it is I have to postpone my return for three months. You
 26928	know me and my relations with Father. I want nothing from him. I have
 26929	been and always shall be independent; but to go against his will and
 26930	arouse his anger, now that he may perhaps remain with us such a short
 26931	time, would destroy half my happiness. I am now writing to him about
 26932	the same question, and beg you to choose a good moment to hand him the
 26933	letter and to let me know how he looks at the whole matter and whether
 26934	there is hope that he may consent to reduce the term by four months.â
 26935	
 26936	After long hesitations, doubts, and prayers, Princess Mary gave the
 26937	letter to her father. The next day the old prince said to her quietly:
 26938	
 26939	âWrite and tell your brother to wait till I am dead.... It wonât be
 26940	longâI shall soon set him free.â
 26941	
 26942	The princess was about to reply, but her father would not let her speak
 26943	and, raising his voice more and more, cried:
 26944	
 26945	âMarry, marry, my boy!... A good family!... Clever people, eh? Rich,
 26946	eh? Yes, a nice stepmother little Nicholas will have! Write and tell him
 26947	that he may marry tomorrow if he likes. She will be little Nicholasâ
 26948	stepmother and Iâll marry Bourienne!... Ha, ha, ha! He mustnât be
 26949	without a stepmother either! Only one thing, no more women are wanted
 26950	in my houseâlet him marry and live by himself. Perhaps you will go
 26951	and live with him too?â he added, turning to Princess Mary. âGo in
 26952	heavenâs name! Go out into the frost... the frost... the frost!â
 26953	
 26954	After this outburst the prince did not speak any more about the matter.
 26955	But repressed vexation at his sonâs poor-spirited behavior found
 26956	expression in his treatment of his daughter. To his former pretexts
 26957	for irony a fresh one was now addedâallusions to stepmothers and
 26958	amiabilities to Mademoiselle Bourienne.
 26959	
 26960	âWhy shouldnât I marry her?â he asked his daughter. âSheâll
 26961	make a splendid princess!â
 26962	
 26963	And latterly, to her surprise and bewilderment, Princess Mary
 26964	noticed that her father was really associating more and more with the
 26965	Frenchwoman. She wrote to Prince Andrew about the reception of his
 26966	letter, but comforted him with hopes of reconciling their father to the
 26967	idea.
 26968	
 26969	Little Nicholas and his education, her brother Andrew, and religion
 26970	were Princess Maryâs joys and consolations; but besides that, since
 26971	everyone must have personal hopes, Princess Mary in the profoundest
 26972	depths of her heart had a hidden dream and hope that supplied the chief
 26973	consolation of her life. This comforting dream and hope were given her
 26974	by Godâs folkâthe half-witted and other pilgrims who visited
 26975	her without the princeâs knowledge. The longer she lived, the more
 26976	experience and observation she had of life, the greater was her wonder
 26977	at the short-sightedness of men who seek enjoyment and happiness here
 26978	on earth: toiling, suffering, struggling, and harming one another, to
 26979	obtain that impossible, visionary, sinful happiness. Prince Andrew had
 26980	loved his wife, she died, but that was not enough: he wanted to bind
 26981	his happiness to another woman. Her father objected to this because he
 26982	wanted a more distinguished and wealthier match for Andrew. And they
 26983	all struggled and suffered and tormented one another and injured their
 26984	souls, their eternal souls, for the attainment of benefits which endure
 26985	but for an instant. Not only do we know this ourselves, but Christ, the
 26986	Son of God, came down to earth and told us that this life is but for
 26987	a moment and is a probation; yet we cling to it and think to find
 26988	happiness in it. âHow is it that no one realizes this?â thought
 26989	Princess Mary. âNo one except these despised Godâs folk who, wallet
 26990	on back, come to me by the back door, afraid of being seen by the
 26991	prince, not for fear of ill-usage by him but for fear of causing him
 26992	to sin. To leave family, home, and all the cares of worldly welfare, in
 26993	order without clinging to anything to wander in hempen rags from place
 26994	to place under an assumed name, doing no one any harm but praying for
 26995	allâfor those who drive one away as well as for those who protect one:
 26996	higher than that life and truth there is no life or truth!â
 26997	
 26998	There was one pilgrim, a quiet pockmarked little woman of fifty called
 26999	Theodosia, who for over thirty years had gone about barefoot and worn
 27000	heavy chains. Princess Mary was particularly fond of her. Once, when in
 27001	a room with a lamp dimly lit before the icon Theodosia was talking of
 27002	her life, the thought that Theodosia alone had found the true path of
 27003	life suddenly came to Princess Mary with such force that she resolved to
 27004	become a pilgrim herself. When Theodosia had gone to sleep Princess Mary
 27005	thought about this for a long time, and at last made up her mind that,
 27006	strange as it might seem, she must go on a pilgrimage. She disclosed
 27007	this thought to no one but to her confessor, Father AkÃ­nfi, the monk,
 27008	and he approved of her intention. Under guise of a present for the
 27009	pilgrims, Princess Mary prepared a pilgrimâs complete costume for
 27010	herself: a coarse smock, bast shoes, a rough coat, and a black kerchief.
 27011	Often, approaching the chest of drawers containing this secret treasure,
 27012	Princess Mary paused, uncertain whether the time had not already come to
 27013	put her project into execution.
 27014	
 27015	Often, listening to the pilgrimsâ tales, she was so stimulated by
 27016	their simple speech, mechanical to them but to her so full of deep
 27017	meaning, that several times she was on the point of abandoning
 27018	everything and running away from home. In imagination she already
 27019	pictured herself by Theodosiaâs side, dressed in coarse rags, walking
 27020	with a staff, a wallet on her back, along the dusty road, directing her
 27021	wanderings from one saintâs shrine to another, free from envy, earthly
 27022	love, or desire, and reaching at last the place where there is no more
 27023	sorrow or sighing, but eternal joy and bliss.
 27024	
 27025	âI shall come to a place and pray there, and before having time to get
 27026	used to it or getting to love it, I shall go farther. I will go on till
 27027	my legs fail, and Iâll lie down and die somewhere, and shall at last
 27028	reach that eternal, quiet haven, where there is neither sorrow nor
 27029	sighing...â thought Princess Mary.
 27030	
 27031	But afterwards, when she saw her father and especially little Koko
 27032	(Nicholas), her resolve weakened. She wept quietly, and felt that she
 27033	was a sinner who loved her father and little nephew more than God.

 27045	CHAPTER I
 27046	
 27047	The Bible legend tells us that the absence of laborâidlenessâwas a
 27048	condition of the first manâs blessedness before the Fall. Fallen man
 27049	has retained a love of idleness, but the curse weighs on the race not
 27050	only because we have to seek our bread in the sweat of our brows, but
 27051	because our moral nature is such that we cannot be both idle and at
 27052	ease. An inner voice tells us we are in the wrong if we are idle. If man
 27053	could find a state in which he felt that though idle he was fulfilling
 27054	his duty, he would have found one of the conditions of manâs primitive
 27055	blessedness. And such a state of obligatory and irreproachable idleness
 27056	is the lot of a whole classâthe military. The chief attraction of
 27057	military service has consisted and will consist in this compulsory and
 27058	irreproachable idleness.
 27059	
 27060	Nicholas RostÃ³v experienced this blissful condition to the full when,
 27061	after 1807, he continued to serve in the PÃ¡vlograd regiment, in which
 27062	he already commanded the squadron he had taken over from DenÃ­sov.
 27063	
 27064	RostÃ³v had become a bluff, good-natured fellow, whom his Moscow
 27065	acquaintances would have considered rather bad form, but who was liked
 27066	and respected by his comrades, subordinates, and superiors, and was well
 27067	contented with his life. Of late, in 1809, he found in letters from home
 27068	more frequent complaints from his mother that their affairs were falling
 27069	into greater and greater disorder, and that it was time for him to come
 27070	back to gladden and comfort his old parents.
 27071	
 27072	Reading these letters, Nicholas felt a dread of their wanting to
 27073	take him away from surroundings in which, protected from all the
 27074	entanglements of life, he was living so calmly and quietly. He felt that
 27075	sooner or later he would have to re-enter that whirlpool of life, with
 27076	its embarrassments and affairs to be straightened out, its accounts
 27077	with stewards, quarrels, and intrigues, its ties, society, and with
 27078	SÃ³nyaâs love and his promise to her. It was all dreadfully difficult
 27079	and complicated; and he replied to his mother in cold, formal letters
 27080	in French, beginning: âMy dear Mamma,â and ending: âYour obedient
 27081	son,â which said nothing of when he would return. In 1810 he received
 27082	letters from his parents, in which they told him of NatÃ¡shaâs
 27083	engagement to BolkÃ³nski, and that the wedding would be in a yearâs
 27084	time because the old prince made difficulties. This letter grieved and
 27085	mortified Nicholas. In the first place he was sorry that NatÃ¡sha, for
 27086	whom he cared more than for anyone else in the family, should be lost to
 27087	the home; and secondly, from his hussar point of view, he regretted not
 27088	to have been there to show that fellow BolkÃ³nski that connection with
 27089	him was no such great honor after all, and that if he loved NatÃ¡sha he
 27090	might dispense with permission from his dotard father. For a moment he
 27091	hesitated whether he should not apply for leave in order to see NatÃ¡sha
 27092	before she was married, but then came the maneuvers, and considerations
 27093	about SÃ³nya and about the confusion of their affairs, and Nicholas
 27094	again put it off. But in the spring of that year, he received a letter
 27095	from his mother, written without his fatherâs knowledge, and that
 27096	letter persuaded him to return. She wrote that if he did not come and
 27097	take matters in hand, their whole property would be sold by auction and
 27098	they would all have to go begging. The count was so weak, and trusted
 27099	MÃ­tenka so much, and was so good-natured, that everybody took advantage
 27100	of him and things were going from bad to worse. âFor Godâs sake, I
 27101	implore you, come at once if you do not wish to make me and the whole
 27102	family wretched,â wrote the countess.
 27103	
 27104	This letter touched Nicholas. He had that common sense of a
 27105	matter-of-fact man which showed him what he ought to do.
 27106	
 27107	The right thing now was, if not to retire from the service, at any rate
 27108	to go home on leave. Why he had to go he did not know; but after his
 27109	after-dinner nap he gave orders to saddle Mars, an extremely vicious
 27110	gray stallion that had not been ridden for a long time, and when
 27111	he returned with the horse all in a lather, he informed LavrÃºshka
 27112	(DenÃ­sovâs servant who had remained with him) and his comrades who
 27113	turned up in the evening that he was applying for leave and was going
 27114	home. Difficult and strange as it was for him to reflect that he would
 27115	go away without having heard from the staffâand this interested him
 27116	extremelyâwhether he was promoted to a captaincy or would receive the
 27117	Order of St. Anne for the last maneuvers; strange as it was to think
 27118	that he would go away without having sold his three roans to the Polish
 27119	Count Golukhovski, who was bargaining for the horses RostÃ³v had betted
 27120	he would sell for two thousand rubles; incomprehensible as it
 27121	seemed that the ball the hussars were giving in honor of the Polish
 27122	Mademoiselle Przazdziecka (out of rivalry to the Uhlans who had given
 27123	one in honor of their Polish Mademoiselle Borzozowska) would take place
 27124	without himâhe knew he must go away from this good, bright world to
 27125	somewhere where everything was stupid and confused. A week later he
 27126	obtained his leave. His hussar comradesânot only those of his own
 27127	regiment, but the whole brigadeâgave RostÃ³v a dinner to which the
 27128	subscription was fifteen rubles a head, and at which there were two
 27129	bands and two choirs of singers. RostÃ³v danced the TrepÃ¡k with Major
 27130	BÃ¡sov; the tipsy officers tossed, embraced, and dropped RostÃ³v; the
 27131	soldiers of the third squadron tossed him too, and shouted âhurrah!â
 27132	and then they put him in his sleigh and escorted him as far as the first
 27133	post station.
 27134	
 27135	During the first half of the journeyâfrom KremenchÃºg to Kievâall
 27136	RostÃ³vâs thoughts, as is usual in such cases, were behind him, with
 27137	the squadron; but when he had gone more than halfway he began to forget
 27138	his three roans and DozhoyvÃ©yko, his quartermaster, and to wonder
 27139	anxiously how things would be at OtrÃ¡dnoe and what he would find
 27140	there. Thoughts of home grew stronger the nearer he approached itâfar
 27141	stronger, as though this feeling of his was subject to the law by which
 27142	the force of attraction is in inverse proportion to the square of the
 27143	distance. At the last post station before OtrÃ¡dnoe he gave the driver a
 27144	three-ruble tip, and on arriving he ran breathlessly, like a boy, up the
 27145	steps of his home.
 27146	
 27147	After the rapture of meeting, and after that odd feeling of unsatisfied
 27148	expectationâthe feeling that âeverything is just the same, so why
 27149	did I hurry?ââNicholas began to settle down in his old home world.
 27150	His father and mother were much the same, only a little older. What was
 27151	new in them was a certain uneasiness and occasional discord, which there
 27152	used not to be, and which, as Nicholas soon found out, was due to the
 27153	bad state of their affairs. SÃ³nya was nearly twenty; she had stopped
 27154	growing prettier and promised nothing more than she was already, but
 27155	that was enough. She exhaled happiness and love from the time Nicholas
 27156	returned, and the faithful, unalterable love of this girl had a
 27157	gladdening effect on him. PÃ©tya and NatÃ¡sha surprised Nicholas
 27158	most. PÃ©tya was a big handsome boy of thirteen, merry, witty, and
 27159	mischievous, with a voice that was already breaking. As for NatÃ¡sha,
 27160	for a long while Nicholas wondered and laughed whenever he looked at
 27161	her.
 27162	
 27163	âYouâre not the same at all,â he said.
 27164	
 27165	âHow? Am I uglier?â
 27166	
 27167	âOn the contrary, but what dignity? A princess!â he whispered to
 27168	her.
 27169	
 27170	âYes, yes, yes!â cried NatÃ¡sha, joyfully.
 27171	
 27172	She told him about her romance with Prince Andrew and of his visit to
 27173	OtrÃ¡dnoe and showed him his last letter.
 27174	
 27175	âWell, are you glad?â NatÃ¡sha asked. âI am so tranquil and happy
 27176	now.â
 27177	
 27178	âVery glad,â answered Nicholas. âHe is an excellent fellow.... And
 27179	are you very much in love?â
 27180	
 27181	âHow shall I put it?â replied NatÃ¡sha. âI was in love with
 27182	BorÃ­s, with my teacher, and with DenÃ­sov, but this is quite different.
 27183	I feel at peace and settled. I know that no better man than he exists,
 27184	and I am calm and contented now. Not at all as before.â
 27185	
 27186	Nicholas expressed his disapproval of the postponement of the marriage
 27187	for a year; but NatÃ¡sha attacked her brother with exasperation, proving
 27188	to him that it could not be otherwise, and that it would be a bad thing
 27189	to enter a family against the fatherâs will, and that she herself
 27190	wished it so.
 27191	
 27192	âYou donât at all understand,â she said.
 27193	
 27194	Nicholas was silent and agreed with her.
 27195	
 27196	Her brother often wondered as he looked at her. She did not seem at
 27197	all like a girl in love and parted from her affianced husband. She was
 27198	even-tempered and calm and quite as cheerful as of old. This amazed
 27199	Nicholas and even made him regard BolkÃ³nskiâs courtship skeptically.
 27200	He could not believe that her fate was sealed, especially as he had
 27201	not seen her with Prince Andrew. It always seemed to him that there was
 27202	something not quite right about this intended marriage.
 27203	
 27204	âWhy this delay? Why no betrothal?â he thought. Once, when he had
 27205	touched on this topic with his mother, he discovered, to his surprise
 27206	and somewhat to his satisfaction, that in the depth of her soul she too
 27207	had doubts about this marriage.
 27208	
 27209	âYou see he writes,â said she, showing her son a letter of Prince
 27210	Andrewâs, with that latent grudge a mother always has in regard to a
 27211	daughterâs future married happiness, âhe writes that he wonât come
 27212	before December. What can be keeping him? Illness, probably! His health
 27213	is very delicate. Donât tell NatÃ¡sha. And donât attach importance
 27214	to her being so bright: thatâs because sheâs living through the last
 27215	days of her girlhood, but I know what she is like every time we receive
 27216	a letter from him! However, God grant that everything turns out well!â
 27217	(She always ended with these words.) âHe is an excellent man!â
 27218	
 27219	
 27220	
 27221	
 27222	
 27223	CHAPTER II
 27224	
 27225	After reaching home Nicholas was at first serious and even dull. He was
 27226	worried by the impending necessity of interfering in the stupid business
 27227	matters for which his mother had called him home. To throw off this
 27228	burden as quickly as possible, on the third day after his arrival he
 27229	went, angry and scowling and without answering questions as to where he
 27230	was going, to MÃ­tenkaâs lodge and demanded an account of everything.
 27231	But what an account of everything might be Nicholas knew even less
 27232	than the frightened and bewildered MÃ­tenka. The conversation and the
 27233	examination of the accounts with MÃ­tenka did not last long. The village
 27234	elder, a peasant delegate, and the village clerk, who were waiting in
 27235	the passage, heard with fear and delight first the young countâs voice
 27236	roaring and snapping and rising louder and louder, and then words of
 27237	abuse, dreadful words, ejaculated one after the other.
 27238	
 27239	âRobber!... Ungrateful wretch!... Iâll hack the dog to pieces! Iâm
 27240	not my father!... Robbing us!...â and so on.
 27241	
 27242	Then with no less fear and delight they saw how the young count, red in
 27243	the face and with bloodshot eyes, dragged MÃ­tenka out by the scruff of
 27244	the neck and applied his foot and knee to his behind with great agility
 27245	at convenient moments between the words, shouting, âBe off! Never let
 27246	me see your face here again, you villain!â
 27247	
 27248	MÃ­tenka flew headlong down the six steps and ran away into the
 27249	shrubbery. (This shrubbery was a well-known haven of refuge for culprits
 27250	at OtrÃ¡dnoe. MÃ­tenka himself, returning tipsy from the town, used
 27251	to hide there, and many of the residents at OtrÃ¡dnoe, hiding from
 27252	MÃ­tenka, knew of its protective qualities.)
 27253	
 27254	MÃ­tenkaâs wife and sisters-in-law thrust their heads and frightened
 27255	faces out of the door of a room where a bright samovar was boiling and
 27256	where the stewardâs high bedstead stood with its patchwork quilt.
 27257	
 27258	The young count paid no heed to them, but, breathing hard, passed by
 27259	with resolute strides and went into the house.
 27260	
 27261	The countess, who heard at once from the maids what had happened at the
 27262	lodge, was calmed by the thought that now their affairs would certainly
 27263	improve, but on the other hand felt anxious as to the effect this
 27264	excitement might have on her son. She went several times to his door on
 27265	tiptoe and listened, as he lighted one pipe after another.
 27266	
 27267	Next day the old count called his son aside and, with an embarrassed
 27268	smile, said to him:
 27269	
 27270	âBut you know, my dear boy, itâs a pity you got excited! MÃ­tenka
 27271	has told me all about it.â
 27272	
 27273	âI knew,â thought Nicholas, âthat I should never understand
 27274	anything in this crazy world.â
 27275	
 27276	âYou were angry that he had not entered those 700 rubles. But they
 27277	were carried forwardâand you did not look at the other page.â
 27278	
 27279	âPapa, he is a blackguard and a thief! I know he is! And what I have
 27280	done, I have done; but, if you like, I wonât speak to him again.â
 27281	
 27282	âNo, my dear boyâ (the count, too, felt embarrassed. He knew he had
 27283	mismanaged his wifeâs property and was to blame toward his children,
 27284	but he did not know how to remedy it). âNo, I beg you to attend to the
 27285	business. I am old. I...â
 27286	
 27287	âNo, Papa. Forgive me if I have caused you unpleasantness. I
 27288	understand it all less than you do.â
 27289	
 27290	âDevil take all these peasants, and money matters, and carryings
 27291	forward from page to page,â he thought. âI used to understand what
 27292	a âcornerâ and the stakes at cards meant, but carrying forward to
 27293	another page I donât understand at all,â said he to himself, and
 27294	after that he did not meddle in business affairs. But once the countess
 27295	called her son and informed him that she had a promissory note from Anna
 27296	MikhÃ¡ylovna for two thousand rubles, and asked him what he thought of
 27297	doing with it.
 27298	
 27299	âThis,â answered Nicholas. âYou say it rests with me. Well, I
 27300	donât like Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna and I donât like BorÃ­s, but they were
 27301	our friends and poor. Well then, this!â and he tore up the note, and
 27302	by so doing caused the old countess to weep tears of joy. After that,
 27303	young RostÃ³v took no further part in any business affairs, but
 27304	devoted himself with passionate enthusiasm to what was to him a new
 27305	pursuitâthe chaseâfor which his father kept a large establishment.
 27306	
 27307	
 27308	
 27309	
 27310	
 27311	CHAPTER III
 27312	
 27313	The weather was already growing wintry and morning frosts congealed
 27314	an earth saturated by autumn rains. The verdure had thickened and its
 27315	bright green stood out sharply against the brownish strips of winter rye
 27316	trodden down by the cattle, and against the pale-yellow stubble of the
 27317	spring buckwheat. The wooded ravines and the copses, which at the end of
 27318	August had still been green islands amid black fields and stubble, had
 27319	become golden and bright-red islands amid the green winter rye. The
 27320	hares had already half changed their summer coats, the fox cubs were
 27321	beginning to scatter, and the young wolves were bigger than dogs. It was
 27322	the best time of the year for the chase. The hounds of that ardent young
 27323	sportsman RostÃ³v had not merely reached hard winter condition, but were
 27324	so jaded that at a meeting of the huntsmen it was decided to give them
 27325	a three daysâ rest and then, on the sixteenth of September, to go on
 27326	a distant expedition, starting from the oak grove where there was an
 27327	undisturbed litter of wolf cubs.
 27328	
 27329	All that day the hounds remained at home. It was frosty and the air was
 27330	sharp, but toward evening the sky became overcast and it began to thaw.
 27331	On the fifteenth, when young RostÃ³v, in his dressing gown, looked out
 27332	of the window, he saw it was an unsurpassable morning for hunting: it
 27333	was as if the sky were melting and sinking to the earth without any
 27334	wind. The only motion in the air was that of the dripping, microscopic
 27335	particles of drizzling mist. The bare twigs in the garden were hung with
 27336	transparent drops which fell on the freshly fallen leaves. The earth in
 27337	the kitchen garden looked wet and black and glistened like poppy seed
 27338	and at a short distance merged into the dull, moist veil of mist.
 27339	Nicholas went out into the wet and muddy porch. There was a smell of
 27340	decaying leaves and of dog. MÃ­lka, a black-spotted, broad-haunched
 27341	bitch with prominent black eyes, got up on seeing her master, stretched
 27342	her hind legs, lay down like a hare, and then suddenly jumped up and
 27343	licked him right on his nose and mustache. Another borzoi, a dog,
 27344	catching sight of his master from the garden path, arched his back
 27345	and, rushing headlong toward the porch with lifted tail, began rubbing
 27346	himself against his legs.
 27347	
 27348	âO-hoy!â came at that moment, that inimitable huntsmanâs call
 27349	which unites the deepest bass with the shrillest tenor, and round
 27350	the corner came Daniel the head huntsman and head kennelman, a gray,
 27351	wrinkled old man with hair cut straight over his forehead, Ukrainian
 27352	fashion, a long bent whip in his hand, and that look of independence
 27353	and scorn of everything that is only seen in huntsmen. He doffed his
 27354	Circassian cap to his master and looked at him scornfully. This scorn
 27355	was not offensive to his master. Nicholas knew that this Daniel,
 27356	disdainful of everybody and who considered himself above them, was all
 27357	the same his serf and huntsman.
 27358	
 27359	âDaniel!â Nicholas said timidly, conscious at the sight of the
 27360	weather, the hounds, and the huntsman that he was being carried away
 27361	by that irresistible passion for sport which makes a man forget all
 27362	his previous resolutions, as a lover forgets in the presence of his
 27363	mistress.
 27364	
 27365	âWhat orders, your excellency?â said the huntsman in his deep bass,
 27366	deep as a proto-deaconâs and hoarse with hallooingâand two flashing
 27367	black eyes gazed from under his brows at his master, who was silent.
 27368	âCan you resist it?â those eyes seemed to be asking.
 27369	
 27370	âItâs a good day, eh? For a hunt and a gallop, eh?â asked
 27371	Nicholas, scratching MÃ­lka behind the ears.
 27372	
 27373	Daniel did not answer, but winked instead.
 27374	
 27375	âI sent UvÃ¡rka at dawn to listen,â his bass boomed out after a
 27376	minuteâs pause. âHe says sheâs moved them into the OtrÃ¡dnoe
 27377	enclosure. They were howling there.â (This meant that the she-wolf,
 27378	about whom they both knew, had moved with her cubs to the OtrÃ¡dnoe
 27379	copse, a small place a mile and a half from the house.)
 27380	
 27381	âWe ought to go, donât you think so?â said Nicholas. âCome to me
 27382	with UvÃ¡rka.â
 27383	
 27384	âAs you please.â
 27385	
 27386	âThen put off feeding them.â
 27387	
 27388	âYes, sir.â
 27389	
 27390	Five minutes later Daniel and UvÃ¡rka were standing in Nicholasâ big
 27391	study. Though Daniel was not a big man, to see him in a room was
 27392	like seeing a horse or a bear on the floor among the furniture and
 27393	surroundings of human life. Daniel himself felt this, and as usual stood
 27394	just inside the door, trying to speak softly and not move, for fear of
 27395	breaking something in the masterâs apartment, and he hastened to say
 27396	all that was necessary so as to get from under that ceiling, out into
 27397	the open under the sky once more.
 27398	
 27399	Having finished his inquiries and extorted from Daniel an opinion that
 27400	the hounds were fit (Daniel himself wished to go hunting), Nicholas
 27401	ordered the horses to be saddled. But just as Daniel was about to
 27402	go NatÃ¡sha came in with rapid steps, not having done up her hair or
 27403	finished dressing and with her old nurseâs big shawl wrapped round
 27404	her. PÃ©tya ran in at the same time.
 27405	
 27406	âYou are going?â asked NatÃ¡sha. âI knew you would! SÃ³nya said
 27407	you wouldnât go, but I knew that today is the sort of day when you
 27408	couldnât help going.â
 27409	
 27410	âYes, we are going,â replied Nicholas reluctantly, for today, as he
 27411	intended to hunt seriously, he did not want to take NatÃ¡sha and PÃ©tya.
 27412	âWe are going, but only wolf hunting: it would be dull for you.â
 27413	
 27414	âYou know it is my greatest pleasure,â said NatÃ¡sha. âItâs not
 27415	fair; you are going by yourself, are having the horses saddled and said
 27416	nothing to us about it.â
 27417	
 27418	ââNo barrier bars a Russianâs pathââweâll go!â shouted
 27419	PÃ©tya.
 27420	
 27421	âBut you canât. Mamma said you mustnât,â said Nicholas to
 27422	NatÃ¡sha.
 27423	
 27424	âYes, Iâll go. I shall certainly go,â said NatÃ¡sha decisively.
 27425	âDaniel, tell them to saddle for us, and Michael must come with my
 27426	dogs,â she added to the huntsman.
 27427	
 27428	It seemed to Daniel irksome and improper to be in a room at all, but to
 27429	have anything to do with a young lady seemed to him impossible. He
 27430	cast down his eyes and hurried out as if it were none of his business,
 27431	careful as he went not to inflict any accidental injury on the young
 27432	lady.
 27433	
 27434	
 27435	
 27436	
 27437	
 27438	CHAPTER IV
 27439	
 27440	The old count, who had always kept up an enormous hunting establishment
 27441	but had now handed it all completely over to his sonâs care, being
 27442	in very good spirits on this fifteenth of September, prepared to go out
 27443	with the others.
 27444	
 27445	In an hourâs time the whole hunting party was at the porch. Nicholas,
 27446	with a stern and serious air which showed that now was no time for
 27447	attending to trifles, went past NatÃ¡sha and PÃ©tya who were trying to
 27448	tell him something. He had a look at all the details of the hunt, sent
 27449	a pack of hounds and huntsmen on ahead to find the quarry, mounted his
 27450	chestnut DonÃ©ts, and whistling to his own leash of borzois, set off
 27451	across the threshing ground to a field leading to the OtrÃ¡dnoe wood.
 27452	The old countâs horse, a sorrel gelding called ViflyÃ¡nka, was led by
 27453	the groom in attendance on him, while the count himself was to drive in
 27454	a small trap straight to a spot reserved for him.
 27455	
 27456	They were taking fifty-four hounds, with six hunt attendants and
 27457	whippers-in. Besides the family, there were eight borzoi kennelmen
 27458	and more than forty borzois, so that, with the borzois on the leash
 27459	belonging to members of the family, there were about a hundred and
 27460	thirty dogs and twenty horsemen.
 27461	
 27462	Each dog knew its master and its call. Each man in the hunt knew his
 27463	business, his place, what he had to do. As soon as they had passed the
 27464	fence they all spread out evenly and quietly, without noise or talk,
 27465	along the road and field leading to the OtrÃ¡dnoe covert.
 27466	
 27467	The horses stepped over the field as over a thick carpet, now and then
 27468	splashing into puddles as they crossed a road. The misty sky still
 27469	seemed to descend evenly and imperceptibly toward the earth, the air
 27470	was still, warm, and silent. Occasionally the whistle of a huntsman,
 27471	the snort of a horse, the crack of a whip, or the whine of a straggling
 27472	hound could be heard.
 27473	
 27474	When they had gone a little less than a mile, five more riders with
 27475	dogs appeared out of the mist, approaching the RostÃ³vs. In front rode a
 27476	fresh-looking, handsome old man with a large gray mustache.
 27477	
 27478	âGood morning, Uncle!â said Nicholas, when the old man drew near.
 27479	
 27480	âThatâs it. Come on!... I was sure of it,â began âUncle.â (He
 27481	was a distant relative of the RostÃ³vsâ, a man of small means, and
 27482	their neighbor.) âI knew you wouldnât be able to resist it and
 27483	itâs a good thing youâre going. Thatâs it! Come on!â (This was
 27484	âUncleâsâ favorite expression.) âTake the covert at once, for my
 27485	GÃ­rchik says the IlÃ¡gins are at KornikÃ­ with their hounds. Thatâs
 27486	it. Come on!... Theyâll take the cubs from under your very nose.â
 27487	
 27488	âThatâs where Iâm going. Shall we join up our packs?â asked
 27489	Nicholas.
 27490	
 27491	The hounds were joined into one pack, and âUncleâ and Nicholas rode
 27492	on side by side. NatÃ¡sha, muffled up in shawls which did not hide her
 27493	eager face and shining eyes, galloped up to them. She was followed by
 27494	PÃ©tya who always kept close to her, by Michael, a huntsman, and by a
 27495	groom appointed to look after her. PÃ©tya, who was laughing, whipped and
 27496	pulled at his horse. NatÃ¡sha sat easily and confidently on her black
 27497	ArÃ¡bchik and reined him in without effort with a firm hand.
 27498	
 27499	âUncleâ looked round disapprovingly at PÃ©tya and NatÃ¡sha. He did
 27500	not like to combine frivolity with the serious business of hunting.
 27501	
 27502	âGood morning, Uncle! We are going too!â shouted PÃ©tya.
 27503	
 27504	âGood morning, good morning! But donât go overriding the hounds,â
 27505	said âUncleâ sternly.
 27506	
 27507	âNicholas, what a fine dog TrunÃ­la is! He knew me,â said NatÃ¡sha,
 27508	referring to her favorite hound.
 27509	
 27510	âIn the first place, TrunÃ­la is not a âdog,â but a harrier,â
 27511	thought Nicholas, and looked sternly at his sister, trying to make her
 27512	feel the distance that ought to separate them at that moment. NatÃ¡sha
 27513	understood it.
 27514	
 27515	âYou mustnât think weâll be in anyoneâs way, Uncle,â she said.
 27516	âWeâll go to our places and wonât budge.â
 27517	
 27518	âA good thing too, little countess,â said âUncle,â âonly mind
 27519	you donât fall off your horse,â he added, âbecauseâthatâs it,
 27520	come on!âyouâve nothing to hold on to.â
 27521	
 27522	The oasis of the OtrÃ¡dnoe covert came in sight a few hundred yards off,
 27523	the huntsmen were already nearing it. RostÃ³v, having finally settled
 27524	with âUncleâ where they should set on the hounds, and having shown
 27525	NatÃ¡sha where she was to standâa spot where nothing could possibly
 27526	run outâwent round above the ravine.
 27527	
 27528	âWell, nephew, youâre going for a big wolf,â said âUncle.â
 27529	âMind and donât let her slip!â
 27530	
 27531	âThatâs as may happen,â answered RostÃ³v. âKarÃ¡y, here!â he
 27532	shouted, answering âUncleâsâ remark by this call to his borzoi.
 27533	KarÃ¡y was a shaggy old dog with a hanging jowl, famous for having
 27534	tackled a big wolf unaided. They all took up their places.
 27535	
 27536	The old count, knowing his sonâs ardor in the hunt, hurried so as not
 27537	to be late, and the huntsmen had not yet reached their places when Count
 27538	IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v, cheerful, flushed, and with quivering cheeks, drove up
 27539	with his black horses over the winter rye to the place reserved for him,
 27540	where a wolf might come out. Having straightened his coat and fastened
 27541	on his hunting knives and horn, he mounted his good, sleek, well-fed,
 27542	and comfortable horse, ViflyÃ¡nka, which was turning gray, like himself.
 27543	His horses and trap were sent home. Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v, though not at
 27544	heart a keen sportsman, knew the rules of the hunt well, and rode to
 27545	the bushy edge of the road where he was to stand, arranged his reins,
 27546	settled himself in the saddle, and, feeling that he was ready, looked
 27547	about with a smile.
 27548	
 27549	Beside him was Simon ChekmÃ¡r, his personal attendant, an old horseman
 27550	now somewhat stiff in the saddle. ChekmÃ¡r held in leash three
 27551	formidable wolfhounds, who had, however, grown fat like their master
 27552	and his horse. Two wise old dogs lay down unleashed. Some hundred paces
 27553	farther along the edge of the wood stood MÃ­tka, the countâs other
 27554	groom, a daring horseman and keen rider to hounds. Before the hunt, by
 27555	old custom, the count had drunk a silver cupful of mulled brandy, taken
 27556	a snack, and washed it down with half a bottle of his favorite Bordeaux.
 27557	
 27558	He was somewhat flushed with the wine and the drive. His eyes were
 27559	rather moist and glittered more than usual, and as he sat in his saddle,
 27560	wrapped up in his fur coat, he looked like a child taken out for an
 27561	outing.
 27562	
 27563	The thin, hollow-cheeked ChekmÃ¡r, having got everything ready, kept
 27564	glancing at his master with whom he had lived on the best of terms for
 27565	thirty years, and understanding the mood he was in expected a pleasant
 27566	chat. A third person rode up circumspectly through the wood (it was
 27567	plain that he had had a lesson) and stopped behind the count. This
 27568	person was a gray-bearded old man in a womanâs cloak, with a tall
 27569	peaked cap on his head. He was the buffoon, who went by a womanâs
 27570	name, NastÃ¡sya IvÃ¡novna.
 27571	
 27572	âWell, NastÃ¡sya IvÃ¡novna!â whispered the count, winking at him.
 27573	âIf you scare away the beast, Danielâll give it you!â
 27574	
 27575	âI know a thing or two myself!â said NastÃ¡sya IvÃ¡novna.
 27576	
 27577	âHush!â whispered the count and turned to Simon. âHave you seen
 27578	the young countess?â he asked. âWhere is she?â
 27579	
 27580	âWith young Count Peter, by the ZhÃ¡rov rank grass,â answered Simon,
 27581	smiling. âThough sheâs a lady, sheâs very fond of hunting.â
 27582	
 27583	âAnd youâre surprised at the way she rides, Simon, eh?â said the
 27584	count. âSheâs as good as many a man!â
 27585	
 27586	âOf course! Itâs marvelous. So bold, so easy!â
 27587	
 27588	âAnd Nicholas? Where is he? By the LyÃ¡dov upland, isnât he?â
 27589	
 27590	âYes, sir. He knows where to stand. He understands the matter so well
 27591	that Daniel and I are often quite astounded,â said Simon, well knowing
 27592	what would please his master.
 27593	
 27594	âRides well, eh? And how well he looks on his horse, eh?â
 27595	
 27596	âA perfect picture! How he chased a fox out of the rank grass by the
 27597	ZavÃ¡rzinsk thicket the other day! Leaped a fearful place; what a sight
 27598	when they rushed from the covert... the horse worth a thousand rubles
 27599	and the rider beyond all price! Yes, one would have to search far to
 27600	find another as smart.â
 27601	
 27602	âTo search far...â repeated the count, evidently sorry Simon had not
 27603	said more. âTo search far,â he said, turning back the skirt of his
 27604	coat to get at his snuffbox.
 27605	
 27606	âThe other day when he came out from Mass in full uniform, Michael
 27607	SidÃ³rych...â Simon did not finish, for on the still air he had
 27608	distinctly caught the music of the hunt with only two or three hounds
 27609	giving tongue. He bent down his head and listened, shaking a warning
 27610	finger at his master. âThey are on the scent of the cubs...â he
 27611	whispered, âstraight to the LyÃ¡dov uplands.â
 27612	
 27613	The count, forgetting to smooth out the smile on his face, looked into
 27614	the distance straight before him, down the narrow open space, holding
 27615	the snuffbox in his hand but not taking any. After the cry of the hounds
 27616	came the deep tones of the wolf call from Danielâs hunting horn; the
 27617	pack joined the first three hounds and they could be heard in full cry,
 27618	with that peculiar lift in the note that indicates that they are after
 27619	a wolf. The whippers-in no longer set on the hounds, but changed to the
 27620	cry of ulyulyu, and above the others rose Danielâs voice, now a deep
 27621	bass, now piercingly shrill. His voice seemed to fill the whole wood and
 27622	carried far beyond out into the open field.
 27623	
 27624	After listening a few moments in silence, the count and his attendant
 27625	convinced themselves that the hounds had separated into two packs: the
 27626	sound of the larger pack, eagerly giving tongue, began to die away in
 27627	the distance, the other pack rushed by the wood past the count, and
 27628	it was with this that Danielâs voice was heard calling ulyulyu.
 27629	The sounds of both packs mingled and broke apart again, but both were
 27630	becoming more distant.
 27631	
 27632	Simon sighed and stooped to straighten the leash a young borzoi had
 27633	entangled; the count too sighed and, noticing the snuffbox in his hand,
 27634	opened it and took a pinch. âBack!â cried Simon to a borzoi that
 27635	was pushing forward out of the wood. The count started and dropped the
 27636	snuffbox. NastÃ¡sya IvÃ¡novna dismounted to pick it up. The count and
 27637	Simon were looking at him.
 27638	
 27639	Then, unexpectedly, as often happens, the sound of the hunt suddenly
 27640	approached, as if the hounds in full cry and Daniel ulyulyuing were just
 27641	in front of them.
 27642	
 27643	The count turned and saw on his right MÃ­tka staring at him with eyes
 27644	starting out of his head, raising his cap and pointing before him to the
 27645	other side.
 27646	
 27647	âLook out!â he shouted, in a voice plainly showing that he had long
 27648	fretted to utter that word, and letting the borzois slip he galloped
 27649	toward the count.
 27650	
 27651	The count and Simon galloped out of the wood and saw on their left a
 27652	wolf which, softly swaying from side to side, was coming at a quiet
 27653	lope farther to the left to the very place where they were standing.
 27654	The angry borzois whined and getting free of the leash rushed past the
 27655	horsesâ feet at the wolf.
 27656	
 27657	The wolf paused, turned its heavy forehead toward the dogs awkwardly,
 27658	like a man suffering from the quinsy, and, still slightly swaying
 27659	from side to side, gave a couple of leaps and with a swish of its tail
 27660	disappeared into the skirt of the wood. At the same instant, with a cry
 27661	like a wail, first one hound, then another, and then another, sprang
 27662	helter-skelter from the wood opposite and the whole pack rushed across
 27663	the field toward the very spot where the wolf had disappeared. The hazel
 27664	bushes parted behind the hounds and Danielâs chestnut horse appeared,
 27665	dark with sweat. On its long back sat Daniel, hunched forward, capless,
 27666	his disheveled gray hair hanging over his flushed, perspiring face.
 27667	
 27668	âUlyulyulyu! ulyulyu!...â he cried. When he caught sight of the
 27669	count his eyes flashed lightning.
 27670	
 27671	âBlast you!â he shouted, holding up his whip threateningly at the
 27672	count.
 27673	
 27674	âYouâve let the wolf go!... What sportsmen!â and as if scorning to
 27675	say more to the frightened and shamefaced count, he lashed the heaving
 27676	flanks of his sweating chestnut gelding with all the anger the count
 27677	had aroused and flew off after the hounds. The count, like a punished
 27678	schoolboy, looked round, trying by a smile to win Simonâs sympathy for
 27679	his plight. But Simon was no longer there. He was galloping round by the
 27680	bushes while the field was coming up on both sides, all trying to head
 27681	the wolf, but it vanished into the wood before they could do so.
 27682	
 27683	
 27684	
 27685	
 27686	
 27687	CHAPTER V
 27688	
 27689	Nicholas RostÃ³v meanwhile remained at his post, waiting for the wolf.
 27690	By the way the hunt approached and receded, by the cries of the dogs
 27691	whose notes were familiar to him, by the way the voices of the huntsmen
 27692	approached, receded, and rose, he realized what was happening at the
 27693	copse. He knew that young and old wolves were there, that the hounds had
 27694	separated into two packs, that somewhere a wolf was being chased, and
 27695	that something had gone wrong. He expected the wolf to come his way any
 27696	moment. He made thousands of different conjectures as to where and
 27697	from what side the beast would come and how he would set upon it. Hope
 27698	alternated with despair. Several times he addressed a prayer to God
 27699	that the wolf should come his way. He prayed with that passionate and
 27700	shamefaced feeling with which men pray at moments of great excitement
 27701	arising from trivial causes. âWhat would it be to Thee to do this for
 27702	me?â he said to God. âI know Thou art great, and that it is a sin to
 27703	ask this of Thee, but for Godâs sake do let the old wolf come my way
 27704	and let KarÃ¡y spring at itâin sight of âUncleâ who is watching
 27705	from over thereâand seize it by the throat in a death grip!â A
 27706	thousand times during that half-hour RostÃ³v cast eager and restless
 27707	glances over the edge of the wood, with the two scraggy oaks rising
 27708	above the aspen undergrowth and the gully with its water-worn side and
 27709	âUncleâsâ cap just visible above the bush on his right.
 27710	
 27711	âNo, I shanât have such luck,â thought RostÃ³v, âyet what
 27712	wouldnât it be worth! It is not to be! Everywhere, at cards and in
 27713	war, I am always unlucky.â Memories of Austerlitz and of DÃ³lokhov
 27714	flashed rapidly and clearly through his mind. âOnly once in my life
 27715	to get an old wolf, I want only that!â thought he, straining eyes and
 27716	ears and looking to the left and then to the right and listening to the
 27717	slightest variation of note in the cries of the dogs.
 27718	
 27719	Again he looked to the right and saw something running toward him across
 27720	the deserted field. âNo, it canât be!â thought RostÃ³v, taking a
 27721	deep breath, as a man does at the coming of something long hoped for.
 27722	The height of happiness was reachedâand so simply, without warning, or
 27723	noise, or display, that RostÃ³v could not believe his eyes and remained
 27724	in doubt for over a second. The wolf ran forward and jumped heavily over
 27725	a gully that lay in her path. She was an old animal with a gray back and
 27726	big reddish belly. She ran without hurry, evidently feeling sure that no
 27727	one saw her. RostÃ³v, holding his breath, looked round at the borzois.
 27728	They stood or lay not seeing the wolf or understanding the situation.
 27729	Old KarÃ¡y had turned his head and was angrily searching for fleas,
 27730	baring his yellow teeth and snapping at his hind legs.
 27731	
 27732	âUlyulyulyu!â whispered RostÃ³v, pouting his lips. The borzois
 27733	jumped up, jerking the rings of the leashes and pricking their ears.
 27734	KarÃ¡y finished scratching his hindquarters and, cocking his ears, got
 27735	up with quivering tail from which tufts of matted hair hung down.
 27736	
 27737	âShall I loose them or not?â Nicholas asked himself as the wolf
 27738	approached him coming from the copse. Suddenly the wolfâs whole
 27739	physiognomy changed: she shuddered, seeing what she had probably never
 27740	seen beforeâhuman eyes fixed upon herâand turning her head a little
 27741	toward RostÃ³v, she paused.
 27742	
 27743	âBack or forward? Eh, no matter, forward...â the wolf seemed to say
 27744	to herself, and she moved forward without again looking round and with a
 27745	quiet, long, easy yet resolute lope.
 27746	
 27747	âUlyulyu!â cried Nicholas, in a voice not his own, and of its own
 27748	accord his good horse darted headlong downhill, leaping over gullies
 27749	to head off the wolf, and the borzois passed it, running faster still.
 27750	Nicholas did not hear his own cry nor feel that he was galloping, nor
 27751	see the borzois, nor the ground over which he went: he saw only the
 27752	wolf, who, increasing her speed, bounded on in the same direction along
 27753	the hollow. The first to come into view was MÃ­lka, with her black
 27754	markings and powerful quarters, gaining upon the wolf. Nearer and
 27755	nearer... now she was ahead of it; but the wolf turned its head to face
 27756	her, and instead of putting on speed as she usually did MÃ­lka suddenly
 27757	raised her tail and stiffened her forelegs.
 27758	
 27759	âUlyulyulyulyu!â shouted Nicholas.
 27760	
 27761	The reddish LyubÃ­m rushed forward from behind MÃ­lka, sprang
 27762	impetuously at the wolf, and seized it by its hindquarters, but
 27763	immediately jumped aside in terror. The wolf crouched, gnashed her
 27764	teeth, and again rose and bounded forward, followed at the distance of a
 27765	couple of feet by all the borzois, who did not get any closer to her.
 27766	
 27767	âSheâll get away! No, itâs impossible!â thought Nicholas, still
 27768	shouting with a hoarse voice.
 27769	
 27770	âKarÃ¡y, ulyulyu!...â he shouted, looking round for the old borzoi
 27771	who was now his only hope. KarÃ¡y, with all the strength age had left
 27772	him, stretched himself to the utmost and, watching the wolf, galloped
 27773	heavily aside to intercept it. But the quickness of the wolfâs
 27774	lope and the borzoiâs slower pace made it plain that KarÃ¡y had
 27775	miscalculated. Nicholas could already see not far in front of him the
 27776	wood where the wolf would certainly escape should she reach it. But,
 27777	coming toward him, he saw hounds and a huntsman galloping almost
 27778	straight at the wolf. There was still hope. A long, yellowish
 27779	young borzoi, one Nicholas did not know, from another leash, rushed
 27780	impetuously at the wolf from in front and almost knocked her over. But
 27781	the wolf jumped up more quickly than anyone could have expected and,
 27782	gnashing her teeth, flew at the yellowish borzoi, which, with a piercing
 27783	yelp, fell with its head on the ground, bleeding from a gash in its
 27784	side.
 27785	
 27786	âKarÃ¡y? Old fellow!...â wailed Nicholas.
 27787	
 27788	Thanks to the delay caused by this crossing of the wolfâs path, the
 27789	old dog with its felted hair hanging from its thigh was within five
 27790	paces of it. As if aware of her danger, the wolf turned her eyes on
 27791	KarÃ¡y, tucked her tail yet further between her legs, and increased
 27792	her speed. But here Nicholas only saw that something happened to
 27793	KarÃ¡yâthe borzoi was suddenly on the wolf, and they rolled together
 27794	down into a gully just in front of them.
 27795	
 27796	That instant, when Nicholas saw the wolf struggling in the gully
 27797	with the dogs, while from under them could be seen her gray hair and
 27798	outstretched hind leg and her frightened choking head, with her ears
 27799	laid back (KarÃ¡y was pinning her by the throat), was the happiest
 27800	moment of his life. With his hand on his saddlebow, he was ready to
 27801	dismount and stab the wolf, when she suddenly thrust her head up from
 27802	among that mass of dogs, and then her forepaws were on the edge of the
 27803	gully. She clicked her teeth (KarÃ¡y no longer had her by the throat),
 27804	leaped with a movement of her hind legs out of the gully, and having
 27805	disengaged herself from the dogs, with tail tucked in again, went
 27806	forward. KarÃ¡y, his hair bristling, and probably bruised or wounded,
 27807	climbed with difficulty out of the gully.
 27808	
 27809	âOh my God! Why?â Nicholas cried in despair.
 27810	
 27811	âUncleâsâ huntsman was galloping from the other side across the
 27812	wolfâs path and his borzois once more stopped the animalâs advance.
 27813	She was again hemmed in.
 27814	
 27815	Nicholas and his attendant, with âUncleâ and his huntsman, were all
 27816	riding round the wolf, crying âulyulyu!â shouting and preparing to
 27817	dismount each moment that the wolf crouched back, and starting forward
 27818	again every time she shook herself and moved toward the wood where she
 27819	would be safe.
 27820	
 27821	Already, at the beginning of this chase, Daniel, hearing the ulyulyuing,
 27822	had rushed out from the wood. He saw KarÃ¡y seize the wolf, and checked
 27823	his horse, supposing the affair to be over. But when he saw that the
 27824	horsemen did not dismount and that the wolf shook herself and ran for
 27825	safety, Daniel set his chestnut galloping, not at the wolf but straight
 27826	toward the wood, just as KarÃ¡y had run to cut the animal off. As
 27827	a result of this, he galloped up to the wolf just when she had been
 27828	stopped a second time by âUncleâsâ borzois.
 27829	
 27830	Daniel galloped up silently, holding a naked dagger in his left hand and
 27831	thrashing the laboring sides of his chestnut horse with his whip as if
 27832	it were a flail.
 27833	
 27834	Nicholas neither saw nor heard Daniel until the chestnut, breathing
 27835	heavily, panted past him, and he heard the fall of a body and saw Daniel
 27836	lying on the wolfâs back among the dogs, trying to seize her by the
 27837	ears. It was evident to the dogs, the hunters, and to the wolf herself
 27838	that all was now over. The terrified wolf pressed back her ears and
 27839	tried to rise, but the borzois stuck to her. Daniel rose a little, took
 27840	a step, and with his whole weight, as if lying down to rest, fell on
 27841	the wolf, seizing her by the ears. Nicholas was about to stab her, but
 27842	Daniel whispered, âDonât! Weâll gag her!â and, changing his
 27843	position, set his foot on the wolfâs neck. A stick was thrust between
 27844	her jaws and she was fastened with a leash, as if bridled, her legs were
 27845	bound together, and Daniel rolled her over once or twice from side to
 27846	side.
 27847	
 27848	With happy, exhausted faces, they laid the old wolf, alive, on a shying
 27849	and snorting horse and, accompanied by the dogs yelping at her, took her
 27850	to the place where they were all to meet. The hounds had killed two of
 27851	the cubs and the borzois three. The huntsmen assembled with their booty
 27852	and their stories, and all came to look at the wolf, which, with her
 27853	broad-browed head hanging down and the bitten stick between her jaws,
 27854	gazed with great glassy eyes at this crowd of dogs and men surrounding
 27855	her. When she was touched, she jerked her bound legs and looked wildly
 27856	yet simply at everybody. Old Count RostÃ³v also rode up and touched the
 27857	wolf.
 27858	
 27859	âOh, what a formidable one!â said he. âA formidable one, eh?â he
 27860	asked Daniel, who was standing near.
 27861	
 27862	âYes, your excellency,â answered Daniel, quickly doffing his cap.
 27863	
 27864	The count remembered the wolf he had let slip and his encounter with
 27865	Daniel.
 27866	
 27867	âAh, but you are a crusty fellow, friend!â said the count.
 27868	
 27869	For sole reply Daniel gave him a shy, childlike, meek, and amiable
 27870	smile.
 27871	
 27872	
 27873	
 27874	
 27875	
 27876	CHAPTER VI
 27877	
 27878	The old count went home, and NatÃ¡sha and PÃ©tya promised to return very
 27879	soon, but as it was still early the hunt went farther. At midday
 27880	they put the hounds into a ravine thickly overgrown with young trees.
 27881	Nicholas standing in a fallow field could see all his whips.
 27882	
 27883	Facing him lay a field of winter rye, there his own huntsman stood alone
 27884	in a hollow behind a hazel bush. The hounds had scarcely been loosed
 27885	before Nicholas heard one he knew, VoltÃ³rn, giving tongue at intervals;
 27886	other hounds joined in, now pausing and now again giving tongue. A
 27887	moment later he heard a cry from the wooded ravine that a fox had been
 27888	found, and the whole pack, joining together, rushed along the ravine
 27889	toward the ryefield and away from Nicholas.
 27890	
 27891	He saw the whips in their red caps galloping along the edge of the
 27892	ravine, he even saw the hounds, and was expecting a fox to show itself
 27893	at any moment on the ryefield opposite.
 27894	
 27895	The huntsman standing in the hollow moved and loosed his borzois, and
 27896	Nicholas saw a queer, short-legged red fox with a fine brush going hard
 27897	across the field. The borzois bore down on it.... Now they drew close
 27898	to the fox which began to dodge between the field in sharper and sharper
 27899	curves, trailing its brush, when suddenly a strange white borzoi dashed
 27900	in followed by a black one, and everything was in confusion; the borzois
 27901	formed a star-shaped figure, scarcely swaying their bodies and with
 27902	tails turned away from the center of the group. Two huntsmen galloped up
 27903	to the dogs; one in a red cap, the other, a stranger, in a green coat.
 27904	
 27905	âWhatâs this?â thought Nicholas. âWhereâs that huntsman from?
 27906	He is not âUncleâsâ man.â
 27907	
 27908	The huntsmen got the fox, but stayed there a long time without strapping
 27909	it to the saddle. Their horses, bridled and with high saddles, stood
 27910	near them and there too the dogs were lying. The huntsmen waved their
 27911	arms and did something to the fox. Then from that spot came the sound of
 27912	a horn, with the signal agreed on in case of a fight.
 27913	
 27914	âThatâs IlÃ¡ginâs huntsman having a row with our IvÃ¡n,â said
 27915	Nicholasâ groom.
 27916	
 27917	Nicholas sent the man to call NatÃ¡sha and PÃ©tya to him, and rode at a
 27918	footpace to the place where the whips were getting the hounds together.
 27919	Several of the field galloped to the spot where the fight was going on.
 27920	
 27921	Nicholas dismounted, and with NatÃ¡sha and PÃ©tya, who had ridden up,
 27922	stopped near the hounds, waiting to see how the matter would end. Out of
 27923	the bushes came the huntsman who had been fighting and rode toward
 27924	his young master, with the fox tied to his crupper. While still at a
 27925	distance he took off his cap and tried to speak respectfully, but he was
 27926	pale and breathless and his face was angry. One of his eyes was black,
 27927	but he probably was not even aware of it.
 27928	
 27929	âWhat has happened?â asked Nicholas.
 27930	
 27931	âA likely thing, killing a fox our dogs had hunted! And it was my gray
 27932	bitch that caught it! Go to law, indeed!... He snatches at the fox! I
 27933	gave him one with the fox. Here it is on my saddle! Do you want a taste
 27934	of this?...â said the huntsman, pointing to his dagger and probably
 27935	imagining himself still speaking to his foe.
 27936	
 27937	Nicholas, not stopping to talk to the man, asked his sister and PÃ©tya
 27938	to wait for him and rode to the spot where the enemyâs, IlÃ¡ginâs,
 27939	hunting party was.
 27940	
 27941	The victorious huntsman rode off to join the field, and there,
 27942	surrounded by inquiring sympathizers, recounted his exploits.
 27943	
 27944	The facts were that IlÃ¡gin, with whom the RostÃ³vs had a quarrel and
 27945	were at law, hunted over places that belonged by custom to the RostÃ³vs,
 27946	and had now, as if purposely, sent his men to the very woods the
 27947	RostÃ³vs were hunting and let his man snatch a fox their dogs had
 27948	chased.
 27949	
 27950	Nicholas, though he had never seen IlÃ¡gin, with his usual absence
 27951	of moderation in judgment, hated him cordially from reports of his
 27952	arbitrariness and violence, and regarded him as his bitterest foe. He
 27953	rode in angry agitation toward him, firmly grasping his whip and fully
 27954	prepared to take the most resolute and desperate steps to punish his
 27955	enemy.
 27956	
 27957	Hardly had he passed an angle of the wood before a stout gentleman in
 27958	a beaver cap came riding toward him on a handsome raven-black horse,
 27959	accompanied by two hunt servants.
 27960	
 27961	Instead of an enemy, Nicholas found in IlÃ¡gin a stately and courteous
 27962	gentleman who was particularly anxious to make the young countâs
 27963	acquaintance. Having ridden up to Nicholas, IlÃ¡gin raised his beaver
 27964	cap and said he much regretted what had occurred and would have the
 27965	man punished who had allowed himself to seize a fox hunted by someone
 27966	elseâs borzois. He hoped to become better acquainted with the count
 27967	and invited him to draw his covert.
 27968	
 27969	NatÃ¡sha, afraid that her brother would do something dreadful, had
 27970	followed him in some excitement. Seeing the enemies exchanging friendly
 27971	greetings, she rode up to them. IlÃ¡gin lifted his beaver cap still
 27972	higher to NatÃ¡sha and said, with a pleasant smile, that the young
 27973	countess resembled Diana in her passion for the chase as well as in her
 27974	beauty, of which he had heard much.
 27975	
 27976	To expiate his huntsmanâs offense, IlÃ¡gin pressed the RostÃ³vs to
 27977	come to an upland of his about a mile away which he usually kept for
 27978	himself and which, he said, swarmed with hares. Nicholas agreed, and the
 27979	hunt, now doubled, moved on.
 27980	
 27981	The way to Iliginâs upland was across the fields. The hunt servants
 27982	fell into line. The masters rode together. âUncle,â RostÃ³v, and
 27983	IlÃ¡gin kept stealthily glancing at one anotherâs dogs, trying not
 27984	to be observed by their companions and searching uneasily for rivals to
 27985	their own borzois.
 27986	
 27987	RostÃ³v was particularly struck by the beauty of a small, pure-bred,
 27988	red-spotted bitch on IlÃ¡ginâs leash, slender but with muscles like
 27989	steel, a delicate muzzle, and prominent black eyes. He had heard of
 27990	the swiftness of IlÃ¡ginâs borzois, and in that beautiful bitch saw a
 27991	rival to his own MÃ­lka.
 27992	
 27993	In the middle of a sober conversation begun by IlÃ¡gin about the
 27994	yearâs harvest, Nicholas pointed to the red-spotted bitch.
 27995	
 27996	âA fine little bitch, that!â said he in a careless tone. âIs she
 27997	swift?â
 27998	
 27999	âThat one? Yes, sheâs a good dog, gets what sheâs after,â
 28000	answered IlÃ¡gin indifferently, of the red-spotted bitch ErzÃ¡, for
 28001	which, a year before, he had given a neighbor three families of house
 28002	serfs. âSo in your parts, too, the harvest is nothing to boast of,
 28003	Count?â he went on, continuing the conversation they had begun. And
 28004	considering it polite to return the young countâs compliment, IlÃ¡gin
 28005	looked at his borzois and picked out MÃ­lka who attracted his attention
 28006	by her breadth. âThat black-spotted one of yours is fineâwell
 28007	shaped!â said he.
 28008	
 28009	âYes, sheâs fast enough,â replied Nicholas, and thought: âIf
 28010	only a full-grown hare would cross the field now Iâd show you what
 28011	sort of borzoi she is,â and turning to his groom, he said he would
 28012	give a ruble to anyone who found a hare.
 28013	
 28014	âI donât understand,â continued IlÃ¡gin, âhow some sportsmen can
 28015	be so jealous about game and dogs. For myself, I can tell you, Count,
 28016	I enjoy riding in company such as this... what could be better?â (he
 28017	again raised his cap to NatÃ¡sha) âbut as for counting skins and what
 28018	one takes, I donât care about that.â
 28019	
 28020	âOf course not!â
 28021	
 28022	âOr being upset because someone elseâs borzoi and not mine catches
 28023	something. All I care about is to enjoy seeing the chase, is it not so,
 28024	Count? For I consider that...â
 28025	
 28026	âA-tu!â came the long-drawn cry of one of the borzoi whippers-in,
 28027	who had halted. He stood on a knoll in the stubble, holding his whip
 28028	aloft, and again repeated his long-drawn cry, âA-tu!â (This call and
 28029	the uplifted whip meant that he saw a sitting hare.)
 28030	
 28031	âAh, he has found one, I think,â said IlÃ¡gin carelessly. âYes, we
 28032	must ride up.... Shall we both course it?â answered Nicholas, seeing
 28033	in ErzÃ¡ and âUncleâsâ red RugÃ¡y two rivals he had never yet had
 28034	a chance of pitting against his own borzois. âAnd suppose they outdo
 28035	my MÃ­lka at once!â he thought as he rode with âUncleâ and IlÃ¡gin
 28036	toward the hare.
 28037	
 28038	âA full-grown one?â asked IlÃ¡gin as he approached the whip who
 28039	had sighted the hareâand not without agitation he looked round and
 28040	whistled to ErzÃ¡.
 28041	
 28042	âAnd you, Michael NikanÃ³rovich?â he said, addressing âUncle.â
 28043	
 28044	The latter was riding with a sullen expression on his face.
 28045	
 28046	âHow can I join in? Why, youâve given a village for each of your
 28047	borzois! Thatâs it, come on! Yours are worth thousands. Try yours
 28048	against one another, you two, and Iâll look on!â
 28049	
 28050	âRugÃ¡y, hey, hey!â he shouted. âRugÃ¡yushka!â he added,
 28051	involuntarily by this diminutive expressing his affection and the hopes
 28052	he placed on this red borzoi. NatÃ¡sha saw and felt the agitation the
 28053	two elderly men and her brother were trying to conceal, and was herself
 28054	excited by it.
 28055	
 28056	The huntsman stood halfway up the knoll holding up his whip and the
 28057	gentlefolk rode up to him at a footpace; the hounds that were far off
 28058	on the horizon turned away from the hare, and the whips, but not the
 28059	gentlefolk, also moved away. All were moving slowly and sedately.
 28060	
 28061	âHow is it pointing?â asked Nicholas, riding a hundred paces toward
 28062	the whip who had sighted the hare.
 28063	
 28064	But before the whip could reply, the hare, scenting the frost coming
 28065	next morning, was unable to rest and leaped up. The pack on leash rushed
 28066	downhill in full cry after the hare, and from all sides the borzois that
 28067	were not on leash darted after the hounds and the hare. All the hunt,
 28068	who had been moving slowly, shouted, âStop!â calling in the hounds,
 28069	while the borzoi whips, with a cry of âA-tu!â galloped across the
 28070	field setting the borzois on the hare. The tranquil IlÃ¡gin, Nicholas,
 28071	NatÃ¡sha, and âUncleâ flew, reckless of where and how they went,
 28072	seeing only the borzois and the hare and fearing only to lose sight even
 28073	for an instant of the chase. The hare they had started was a strong and
 28074	swift one. When he jumped up he did not run at once, but pricked his
 28075	ears listening to the shouting and trampling that resounded from all
 28076	sides at once. He took a dozen bounds, not very quickly, letting the
 28077	borzois gain on him, and, finally having chosen his direction and
 28078	realized his danger, laid back his ears and rushed off headlong. He had
 28079	been lying in the stubble, but in front of him was the autumn sowing
 28080	where the ground was soft. The two borzois of the huntsman who had
 28081	sighted him, having been the nearest, were the first to see and pursue
 28082	him, but they had not gone far before IlÃ¡ginâs red-spotted ErzÃ¡
 28083	passed them, got within a length, flew at the hare with terrible
 28084	swiftness aiming at his scut, and, thinking she had seized him, rolled
 28085	over like a ball. The hare arched his back and bounded off yet more
 28086	swiftly. From behind ErzÃ¡ rushed the broad-haunched, black-spotted
 28087	MÃ­lka and began rapidly gaining on the hare.
 28088	
 28089	âMilÃ¡shka, dear!â rose Nicholasâ triumphant cry. It looked as if
 28090	MÃ­lka would immediately pounce on the hare, but she overtook him and
 28091	flew past. The hare had squatted. Again the beautiful ErzÃ¡ reached him,
 28092	but when close to the hareâs scut paused as if measuring the distance,
 28093	so as not to make a mistake this time but seize his hind leg.
 28094	
 28095	âErzÃ¡, darling!â IlÃ¡gin wailed in a voice unlike his own. ErzÃ¡
 28096	did not hearken to his appeal. At the very moment when she would have
 28097	seized her prey, the hare moved and darted along the balk between the
 28098	winter rye and the stubble. Again ErzÃ¡ and MÃ­lka were abreast, running
 28099	like a pair of carriage horses, and began to overtake the hare, but
 28100	it was easier for the hare to run on the balk and the borzois did not
 28101	overtake him so quickly.
 28102	
 28103	âRugÃ¡y, RugÃ¡yushka! Thatâs it, come on!â came a third voice just
 28104	then, and âUncleâsâ red borzoi, straining and curving its back,
 28105	caught up with the two foremost borzois, pushed ahead of them regardless
 28106	of the terrible strain, put on speed close to the hare, knocked it off
 28107	the balk onto the ryefield, again put on speed still more viciously,
 28108	sinking to his knees in the muddy field, and all one could see was
 28109	how, muddying his back, he rolled over with the hare. A ring of borzois
 28110	surrounded him. A moment later everyone had drawn up round the crowd
 28111	of dogs. Only the delighted âUncleâ dismounted, and cut off a pad,
 28112	shaking the hare for the blood to drip off, and anxiously glancing round
 28113	with restless eyes while his arms and legs twitched. He spoke without
 28114	himself knowing whom to or what about. âThatâs it, come on! Thatâs
 28115	a dog!... There, it has beaten them all, the thousand-ruble as well as
 28116	the one-ruble borzois. Thatâs it, come on!â said he, panting and
 28117	looking wrathfully around as if he were abusing someone, as if they
 28118	were all his enemies and had insulted him, and only now had he at
 28119	last succeeded in justifying himself. âThere are your thousand-ruble
 28120	ones.... Thatâs it, come on!...â
 28121	
 28122	âRugÃ¡y, hereâs a pad for you!â he said, throwing down the
 28123	hareâs muddy pad. âYouâve deserved it, thatâs it, come on!â
 28124	
 28125	âSheâd tired herself out, sheâd run it down three times by
 28126	herself,â said Nicholas, also not listening to anyone and regardless
 28127	of whether he were heard or not.
 28128	
 28129	âBut what is there in running across it like that?â said IlÃ¡ginâs
 28130	groom.
 28131	
 28132	âOnce she had missed it and turned it away, any mongrel could take
 28133	it,â IlÃ¡gin was saying at the same time, breathless from his gallop
 28134	and his excitement. At the same moment NatÃ¡sha, without drawing
 28135	breath, screamed joyously, ecstatically, and so piercingly that it set
 28136	everyoneâs ear tingling. By that shriek she expressed what the others
 28137	expressed by all talking at once, and it was so strange that she must
 28138	herself have been ashamed of so wild a cry and everyone else would have
 28139	been amazed at it at any other time. âUncleâ himself twisted up the
 28140	hare, threw it neatly and smartly across his horseâs back as if by
 28141	that gesture he meant to rebuke everybody, and, with an air of not
 28142	wishing to speak to anyone, mounted his bay and rode off. The others all
 28143	followed, dispirited and shamefaced, and only much later were they able
 28144	to regain their former affectation of indifference. For a long time they
 28145	continued to look at red RugÃ¡y who, his arched back spattered with
 28146	mud and clanking the ring of his leash, walked along just behind
 28147	âUncleâsâ horse with the serene air of a conqueror.
 28148	
 28149	âWell, I am like any other dog as long as itâs not a question of
 28150	coursing. But when it is, then look out!â his appearance seemed to
 28151	Nicholas to be saying.
 28152	
 28153	When, much later, âUncleâ rode up to Nicholas and began talking
 28154	to him, he felt flattered that, after what had happened, âUncleâ
 28155	deigned to speak to him.
 28156	
 28157	
 28158	
 28159	
 28160	
 28161	CHAPTER VII
 28162	
 28163	Toward evening IlÃ¡gin took leave of Nicholas, who found that they were
 28164	so far from home that he accepted âUncleâsâ offer that the hunting
 28165	party should spend the night in his little village of MikhÃ¡ylovna.
 28166	
 28167	âAnd if you put up at my house that will be better still. Thatâs it,
 28168	come on!â said âUncle.â âYou see itâs damp weather, and you
 28169	could rest, and the little countess could be driven home in a trap.â
 28170	
 28171	âUncleâsâ offer was accepted. A huntsman was sent to OtrÃ¡dnoe for
 28172	a trap, while Nicholas rode with NatÃ¡sha and PÃ©tya to âUncleâsâ
 28173	house.
 28174	
 28175	Some five male domestic serfs, big and little, rushed out to the front
 28176	porch to meet their master. A score of women serfs, old and young, as
 28177	well as children, popped out from the back entrance to have a look at
 28178	the hunters who were arriving. The presence of NatÃ¡shaâa woman, a
 28179	lady, and on horsebackâraised the curiosity of the serfs to such a
 28180	degree that many of them came up to her, stared her in the face, and
 28181	unabashed by her presence made remarks about her as though she were some
 28182	prodigy on show and not a human being able to hear or understand what
 28183	was said about her.
 28184	
 28185	âArÃ­nka! Look, she sits sideways! There she sits and her skirt
 28186	dangles.... See, sheâs got a little hunting horn!â
 28187	
 28188	âGoodness gracious! See her knife?...â
 28189	
 28190	âIsnât she a Tartar!â
 28191	
 28192	âHow is it you didnât go head over heels?â asked the boldest of
 28193	all, addressing NatÃ¡sha directly.
 28194	
 28195	âUncleâ dismounted at the porch of his little wooden house which
 28196	stood in the midst of an overgrown garden and, after a glance at his
 28197	retainers, shouted authoritatively that the superfluous ones should take
 28198	themselves off and that all necessary preparations should be made to
 28199	receive the guests and the visitors.
 28200	
 28201	The serfs all dispersed. âUncleâ lifted NatÃ¡sha off her horse and
 28202	taking her hand led her up the rickety wooden steps of the porch. The
 28203	house, with its bare, unplastered log walls, was not overcleanâit
 28204	did not seem that those living in it aimed at keeping it spotlessâbut
 28205	neither was it noticeably neglected. In the entry there was a smell of
 28206	fresh apples, and wolf and fox skins hung about.
 28207	
 28208	âUncleâ led the visitors through the anteroom into a small hall with
 28209	a folding table and red chairs, then into the drawing room with a round
 28210	birchwood table and a sofa, and finally into his private room where
 28211	there was a tattered sofa, a worn carpet, and portraits of SuvÃ³rov, of
 28212	the hostâs father and mother, and of himself in military uniform. The
 28213	study smelt strongly of tobacco and dogs. âUncleâ asked his visitors
 28214	to sit down and make themselves at home, and then went out of the room.
 28215	RugÃ¡y, his back still muddy, came into the room and lay down on the
 28216	sofa, cleaning himself with his tongue and teeth. Leading from the study
 28217	was a passage in which a partition with ragged curtains could be
 28218	seen. From behind this came womenâs laughter and whispers. NatÃ¡sha,
 28219	Nicholas, and PÃ©tya took off their wraps and sat down on the sofa.
 28220	PÃ©tya, leaning on his elbow, fell asleep at once. NatÃ¡sha and Nicholas
 28221	were silent. Their faces glowed, they were hungry and very cheerful.
 28222	They looked at one another (now that the hunt was over and they were in
 28223	the house, Nicholas no longer considered it necessary to show his manly
 28224	superiority over his sister), NatÃ¡sha gave him a wink, and neither
 28225	refrained long from bursting into a peal of ringing laughter even before
 28226	they had a pretext ready to account for it.
 28227	
 28228	After a while âUncleâ came in, in a Cossack coat, blue trousers, and
 28229	small top boots. And NatÃ¡sha felt that this costume, the very one she
 28230	had regarded with surprise and amusement at OtrÃ¡dnoe, was just the
 28231	right thing and not at all worse than a swallow-tail or frock coat.
 28232	âUncleâ too was in high spirits and far from being offended by the
 28233	brotherâs and sisterâs laughter (it could never enter his head that
 28234	they might be laughing at his way of life) he himself joined in the
 28235	merriment.
 28236	
 28237	âThatâs right, young countess, thatâs it, come on! I never saw
 28238	anyone like her!â said he, offering Nicholas a pipe with a long stem
 28239	and, with a practiced motion of three fingers, taking down another that
 28240	had been cut short. âSheâs ridden all day like a man, and is as
 28241	fresh as ever!â
 28242	
 28243	Soon after âUncleâsâ reappearance the door was opened, evidently
 28244	from the sound by a barefooted girl, and a stout, rosy, good-looking
 28245	woman of about forty, with a double chin and full red lips, entered
 28246	carrying a large loaded tray. With hospitable dignity and cordiality in
 28247	her glance and in every motion, she looked at the visitors and, with
 28248	a pleasant smile, bowed respectfully. In spite of her exceptional
 28249	stoutness, which caused her to protrude her chest and stomach and throw
 28250	back her head, this woman (who was âUncleâsâ housekeeper) trod
 28251	very lightly. She went to the table, set down the tray, and with her
 28252	plump white hands deftly took from it the bottles and various hors
 28253	dâoeuvres and dishes and arranged them on the table. When she had
 28254	finished, she stepped aside and stopped at the door with a smile on her
 28255	face. âHere I am. I am she! Now do you understand âUncleâ?â her
 28256	expression said to RostÃ³v. How could one help understanding? Not only
 28257	Nicholas, but even NatÃ¡sha understood the meaning of his puckered brow
 28258	and the happy complacent smile that slightly puckered his lips when
 28259	AnÃ­sya FÃ«dorovna entered. On the tray was a bottle of herb wine,
 28260	different kinds of vodka, pickled mushrooms, rye cakes made with
 28261	buttermilk, honey in the comb, still mead and sparkling mead, apples,
 28262	nuts (raw and roasted), and nut-and-honey sweets. Afterwards she brought
 28263	a freshly roasted chicken, ham, preserves made with honey, and preserves
 28264	made with sugar.
 28265	
 28266	All this was the fruit of AnÃ­sya FÃ«dorovnaâs housekeeping, gathered
 28267	and prepared by her. The smell and taste of it all had a smack
 28268	of AnÃ­sya FÃ«dorovna herself: a savor of juiciness, cleanliness,
 28269	whiteness, and pleasant smiles.
 28270	
 28271	âTake this, little Lady-Countess!â she kept saying, as she offered
 28272	NatÃ¡sha first one thing and then another.
 28273	
 28274	NatÃ¡sha ate of everything and thought she had never seen or eaten such
 28275	buttermilk cakes, such aromatic jam, such honey-and-nut sweets, or such
 28276	a chicken anywhere. AnÃ­sya FÃ«dorovna left the room.
 28277	
 28278	After supper, over their cherry brandy, RostÃ³v and âUncleâ talked
 28279	of past and future hunts, of RugÃ¡y and IlÃ¡ginâs dogs, while NatÃ¡sha
 28280	sat upright on the sofa and listened with sparkling eyes. She tried
 28281	several times to wake PÃ©tya that he might eat something, but he
 28282	only muttered incoherent words without waking up. NatÃ¡sha felt so
 28283	lighthearted and happy in these novel surroundings that she only feared
 28284	the trap would come for her too soon. After a casual pause, such as
 28285	often occurs when receiving friends for the first time in oneâs own
 28286	house, âUncle,â answering a thought that was in his visitorsâ
 28287	minds, said:
 28288	
 28289	âThis, you see, is how I am finishing my days... Death will come.
 28290	Thatâs it, come on! Nothing will remain. Then why harm anyone?â
 28291	
 28292	âUncleâsâ face was very significant and even handsome as he said
 28293	this. Involuntarily RostÃ³v recalled all the good he had heard about
 28294	him from his father and the neighbors. Throughout the whole province
 28295	âUncleâ had the reputation of being the most honorable and
 28296	disinterested of cranks. They called him in to decide family disputes,
 28297	chose him as executor, confided secrets to him, elected him to be a
 28298	justice and to other posts; but he always persistently refused public
 28299	appointments, passing the autumn and spring in the fields on his bay
 28300	gelding, sitting at home in winter, and lying in his overgrown garden in
 28301	summer.
 28302	
 28303	âWhy donât you enter the service, Uncle?â
 28304	
 28305	âI did once, but gave it up. I am not fit for it. Thatâs it, come
 28306	on! I canât make head or tail of it. Thatâs for youâI havenât
 28307	brains enough. Now, hunting is another matterâthatâs it, come on!
 28308	Open the door, there!â he shouted. âWhy have you shut it?â
 28309	
 28310	The door at the end of the passage led to the huntsmenâs room, as they
 28311	called the room for the hunt servants.
 28312	
 28313	There was a rapid patter of bare feet, and an unseen hand opened the
 28314	door into the huntsmenâs room, from which came the clear sounds of a
 28315	balalÃ¡yka on which someone, who was evidently a master of the art, was
 28316	playing. NatÃ¡sha had been listening to those strains for some time and
 28317	now went out into the passage to hear better.
 28318	
 28319	âThatâs MÃ­tka, my coachman.... I have got him a good balalÃ¡yka.
 28320	Iâm fond of it,â said âUncle.â
 28321	
 28322	It was the custom for MÃ­tka to play the balalÃ¡yka in the huntsmenâs
 28323	room when âUncleâ returned from the chase. âUncleâ was fond of
 28324	such music.
 28325	
 28326	âHow good! Really very good!â said Nicholas with some unintentional
 28327	superciliousness, as if ashamed to confess that the sounds pleased him
 28328	very much.
 28329	
 28330	âVery good?â said NatÃ¡sha reproachfully, noticing her brotherâs
 28331	tone. âNot âvery goodâ itâs simply delicious!â
 28332	
 28333	Just as âUncleâsâ pickled mushrooms, honey, and cherry brandy had
 28334	seemed to her the best in the world, so also that song, at that moment,
 28335	seemed to her the acme of musical delight.
 28336	
 28337	âMore, please, more!â cried NatÃ¡sha at the door as soon as the
 28338	balalÃ¡yka ceased. MÃ­tka tuned up afresh, and recommenced thrumming
 28339	the balalÃ¡yka to the air of My Lady, with trills and variations.
 28340	âUncleâ sat listening, slightly smiling, with his head on one side.
 28341	The air was repeated a hundred times. The balalÃ¡yka was retuned several
 28342	times and the same notes were thrummed again, but the listeners did
 28343	not grow weary of it and wished to hear it again and again. AnÃ­sya
 28344	FÃ«dorovna came in and leaned her portly person against the doorpost.
 28345	
 28346	âYou like listening?â she said to NatÃ¡sha, with a smile extremely
 28347	like âUncleâs.â âThatâs a good player of ours,â she added.
 28348	
 28349	âHe doesnât play that part right!â said âUncleâ suddenly, with
 28350	an energetic gesture. âHere he ought to burst outâthatâs it, come
 28351	on!âought to burst out.â
 28352	
 28353	âDo you play then?â asked NatÃ¡sha.
 28354	
 28355	âUncleâ did not answer, but smiled.
 28356	
 28357	âAnÃ­sya, go and see if the strings of my guitar are all right. I
 28358	havenât touched it for a long time. Thatâs itâcome on! Iâve
 28359	given it up.â
 28360	
 28361	AnÃ­sya FÃ«dorovna, with her light step, willingly went to fulfill her
 28362	errand and brought back the guitar.
 28363	
 28364	Without looking at anyone, âUncleâ blew the dust off it and, tapping
 28365	the case with his bony fingers, tuned the guitar and settled himself in
 28366	his armchair. He took the guitar a little above the fingerboard, arching
 28367	his left elbow with a somewhat theatrical gesture, and, with a wink at
 28368	AnÃ­sya FÃ«dorovna, struck a single chord, pure and sonorous, and then
 28369	quietly, smoothly, and confidently began playing in very slow time, not
 28370	My Lady, but the well-known song: Came a maiden down the street. The
 28371	tune, played with precision and in exact time, began to thrill in the
 28372	hearts of Nicholas and NatÃ¡sha, arousing in them the same kind of
 28373	sober mirth as radiated from AnÃ­sya FÃ«dorovnaâs whole being. AnÃ­sya
 28374	FÃ«dorovna flushed, and drawing her kerchief over her face went laughing
 28375	out of the room. âUncleâ continued to play correctly, carefully,
 28376	with energetic firmness, looking with a changed and inspired expression
 28377	at the spot where AnÃ­sya FÃ«dorovna had just stood. Something seemed to
 28378	be laughing a little on one side of his face under his gray mustaches,
 28379	especially as the song grew brisker and the time quicker and when, here
 28380	and there, as he ran his fingers over the strings, something seemed to
 28381	snap.
 28382	
 28383	âLovely, lovely! Go on, Uncle, go on!â shouted NatÃ¡sha as soon as
 28384	he had finished. She jumped up and hugged and kissed him. âNicholas,
 28385	Nicholas!â she said, turning to her brother, as if asking him: âWhat
 28386	is it moves me so?â
 28387	
 28388	Nicholas too was greatly pleased by âUncleâsâ playing, and
 28389	âUncleâ played the piece over again. AnÃ­sya FÃ«dorovnaâs smiling
 28390	face reappeared in the doorway and behind hers other faces...
 28391	
 28392	    Fetching water clear and sweet,
 28393	    Stop, dear maiden, I entreatâ
 28394	
 28395	played âUncleâ once more, running his fingers skillfully over the
 28396	strings, and then he stopped short and jerked his shoulders.
 28397	
 28398	âGo on, Uncle dear,â NatÃ¡sha wailed in an imploring tone as if her
 28399	life depended on it.
 28400	
 28401	âUncleâ rose, and it was as if there were two men in him: one of
 28402	them smiled seriously at the merry fellow, while the merry fellow struck
 28403	a naÃ¯ve and precise attitude preparatory to a folk dance.
 28404	
 28405	âNow then, niece!â he exclaimed, waving to NatÃ¡sha the hand that
 28406	had just struck a chord.
 28407	
 28408	NatÃ¡sha threw off the shawl from her shoulders, ran forward to face
 28409	âUncle,â and setting her arms akimbo also made a motion with her
 28410	shoulders and struck an attitude.
 28411	
 28412	Where, how, and when had this young countess, educated by an Ã©migrÃ©e
 28413	French governess, imbibed from the Russian air she breathed that spirit
 28414	and obtained that manner which the pas de chÃ¢le * would, one would have
 28415	supposed, long ago have effaced? But the spirit and the movements were
 28416	those inimitable and unteachable Russian ones that âUncleâ had
 28417	expected of her. As soon as she had struck her pose, and smiled
 28418	triumphantly, proudly, and with sly merriment, the fear that had at
 28419	first seized Nicholas and the others that she might not do the right
 28420	thing was at an end, and they were already admiring her.
 28421	
 28422	    * The French shawl dance.
 28423	
 28424	She did the right thing with such precision, such complete precision,
 28425	that AnÃ­sya FÃ«dorovna, who had at once handed her the handkerchief she
 28426	needed for the dance, had tears in her eyes, though she laughed as she
 28427	watched this slim, graceful countess, reared in silks and velvets and so
 28428	different from herself, who yet was able to understand all that was
 28429	in AnÃ­sya and in AnÃ­syaâs father and mother and aunt, and in every
 28430	Russian man and woman.
 28431	
 28432	âWell, little countess; thatâs itâcome on!â cried âUncle,â
 28433	with a joyous laugh, having finished the dance. âWell done, niece! Now
 28434	a fine young fellow must be found as husband for you. Thatâs itâcome
 28435	on!â
 28436	
 28437	âHeâs chosen already,â said Nicholas smiling.
 28438	
 28439	âOh?â said âUncleâ in surprise, looking inquiringly at NatÃ¡sha,
 28440	who nodded her head with a happy smile.
 28441	
 28442	âAnd such a one!â she said. But as soon as she had said it a new
 28443	train of thoughts and feelings arose in her. âWhat did Nicholasâ
 28444	smile mean when he said âchosen alreadyâ? Is he glad of it or not?
 28445	It is as if he thought my BolkÃ³nski would not approve of or understand
 28446	our gaiety. But he would understand it all. Where is he now?â she
 28447	thought, and her face suddenly became serious. But this lasted only a
 28448	second. âDonât dare to think about it,â she said to herself,
 28449	and sat down again smilingly beside âUncle,â begging him to play
 28450	something more.
 28451	
 28452	âUncleâ played another song and a valse; then after a pause he
 28453	cleared his throat and sang his favorite hunting song:
 28454	
 28455	    As âtwas growing dark last night
 28456	    Fell the snow so soft and light...
 28457	
 28458	âUncleâ sang as peasants sing, with full and naÃ¯ve conviction that
 28459	the whole meaning of a song lies in the words and that the tune comes
 28460	of itself, and that apart from the words there is no tune, which exists
 28461	only to give measure to the words. As a result of this the unconsidered
 28462	tune, like the song of a bird, was extraordinarily good. NatÃ¡sha was in
 28463	ecstasies over âUncleâsâ singing. She resolved to give up learning
 28464	the harp and to play only the guitar. She asked âUncleâ for his
 28465	guitar and at once found the chords of the song.
 28466	
 28467	After nine oâclock two traps and three mounted men, who had been sent
 28468	to look for them, arrived to fetch NatÃ¡sha and PÃ©tya. The count and
 28469	countess did not know where they were and were very anxious, said one of
 28470	the men.
 28471	
 28472	PÃ©tya was carried out like a log and laid in the larger of the two
 28473	traps. NatÃ¡sha and Nicholas got into the other. âUncleâ wrapped
 28474	NatÃ¡sha up warmly and took leave of her with quite a new tenderness. He
 28475	accompanied them on foot as far as the bridge that could not be crossed,
 28476	so that they had to go round by the ford, and he sent huntsmen to ride
 28477	in front with lanterns.
 28478	
 28479	âGood-by, dear niece,â his voice called out of the darknessânot
 28480	the voice NatÃ¡sha had known previously, but the one that had sung As
 28481	âtwas growing dark last night.
 28482	
 28483	In the village through which they passed there were red lights and a
 28484	cheerful smell of smoke.
 28485	
 28486	âWhat a darling Uncle is!â said NatÃ¡sha, when they had come out
 28487	onto the highroad.
 28488	
 28489	âYes,â returned Nicholas. âYouâre not cold?â
 28490	
 28491	âNo. Iâm quite, quite all right. I feel so comfortable!â answered
 28492	NatÃ¡sha, almost perplexed by her feelings. They remained silent a long
 28493	while. The night was dark and damp. They could not see the horses, but
 28494	only heard them splashing through the unseen mud.
 28495	
 28496	What was passing in that receptive childlike soul that so eagerly caught
 28497	and assimilated all the diverse impressions of life? How did they all
 28498	find place in her? But she was very happy. As they were nearing home she
 28499	suddenly struck up the air of As âtwas growing dark last nightâthe
 28500	tune of which she had all the way been trying to get and had at last
 28501	caught.
 28502	
 28503	âGot it?â said Nicholas.
 28504	
 28505	âWhat were you thinking about just now, Nicholas?â inquired
 28506	NatÃ¡sha.
 28507	
 28508	They were fond of asking one another that question.
 28509	
 28510	âI?â said Nicholas, trying to remember. âWell, you see, first I
 28511	thought that RugÃ¡y, the red hound, was like Uncle, and that if he were
 28512	a man he would always keep Uncle near him, if not for his riding, then
 28513	for his manner. What a good fellow Uncle is! Donât you think so?...
 28514	Well, and you?â
 28515	
 28516	âI? Wait a bit, wait.... Yes, first I thought that we are driving
 28517	along and imagining that we are going home, but that heaven knows
 28518	where we are really going in the darkness, and that we shall arrive and
 28519	suddenly find that we are not in OtrÃ¡dnoe, but in Fairyland. And then I
 28520	thought... No, nothing else.â
 28521	
 28522	âI know, I expect you thought of him,â said Nicholas, smiling as
 28523	NatÃ¡sha knew by the sound of his voice.
 28524	
 28525	âNo,â said NatÃ¡sha, though she had in reality been thinking about
 28526	Prince Andrew at the same time as of the rest, and of how he would
 28527	have liked âUncle.â âAnd then I was saying to myself all the way,
 28528	âHow well AnÃ­sya carried herself, how well!ââ And Nicholas heard
 28529	her spontaneous, happy, ringing laughter. âAnd do you know,â she
 28530	suddenly said, âI know that I shall never again be as happy and
 28531	tranquil as I am now.â
 28532	
 28533	âRubbish, nonsense, humbug!â exclaimed Nicholas, and he thought:
 28534	âHow charming this NatÃ¡sha of mine is! I have no other friend like
 28535	her and never shall have. Why should she marry? We might always drive
 28536	about together!â
 28537	
 28538	âWhat a darling this Nicholas of mine is!â thought NatÃ¡sha.
 28539	
 28540	âAh, there are still lights in the drawing room!â she said, pointing
 28541	to the windows of the house that gleamed invitingly in the moist velvety
 28542	darkness of the night.

 28548	CHAPTER VIII
 28549	
 28550	Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v had resigned the position of Marshal of the Nobility
 28551	because it involved him in too much expense, but still his affairs
 28552	did not improve. NatÃ¡sha and Nicholas often noticed their parents
 28553	conferring together anxiously and privately and heard suggestions of
 28554	selling the fine ancestral RostÃ³v house and estate near Moscow. It was
 28555	not necessary to entertain so freely as when the count had been Marshal,
 28556	and life at OtrÃ¡dnoe was quieter than in former years, but still the
 28557	enormous house and its lodges were full of people and more than twenty
 28558	sat down to table every day. These were all their own people who had
 28559	settled down in the house almost as members of the family, or persons
 28560	who were, it seemed, obliged to live in the countâs house. Such were
 28561	Dimmler the musician and his wife, Vogel the dancing master and his
 28562	family, BelÃ³va, an old maiden lady, an inmate of the house, and many
 28563	others such as PÃ©tyaâs tutors, the girlsâ former governess, and
 28564	other people who simply found it preferable and more advantageous to
 28565	live in the countâs house than at home. They had not as many visitors
 28566	as before, but the old habits of life without which the count and
 28567	countess could not conceive of existence remained unchanged. There was
 28568	still the hunting establishment which Nicholas had even enlarged, the
 28569	same fifty horses and fifteen grooms in the stables, the same expensive
 28570	presents and dinner parties to the whole district on name days; there
 28571	were still the countâs games of whist and boston, at whichâspreading
 28572	out his cards so that everybody could see themâhe let himself be
 28573	plundered of hundreds of rubles every day by his neighbors, who looked
 28574	upon an opportunity to play a rubber with Count RostÃ³v as a most
 28575	profitable source of income.
 28576	
 28577	The count moved in his affairs as in a huge net, trying not to believe
 28578	that he was entangled but becoming more and more so at every step, and
 28579	feeling too feeble to break the meshes or to set to work carefully and
 28580	patiently to disentangle them. The countess, with her loving heart, felt
 28581	that her children were being ruined, that it was not the countâs fault
 28582	for he could not help being what he wasâthat (though he tried to
 28583	hide it) he himself suffered from the consciousness of his own and
 28584	his childrenâs ruin, and she tried to find means of remedying the
 28585	position. From her feminine point of view she could see only one
 28586	solution, namely, for Nicholas to marry a rich heiress. She felt this to
 28587	be their last hope and that if Nicholas refused the match she had found
 28588	for him, she would have to abandon the hope of ever getting matters
 28589	right. This match was with Julie KarÃ¡gina, the daughter of excellent
 28590	and virtuous parents, a girl the RostÃ³vs had known from childhood, and
 28591	who had now become a wealthy heiress through the death of the last of
 28592	her brothers.
 28593	
 28594	The countess had written direct to Julieâs mother in Moscow suggesting
 28595	a marriage between their children and had received a favorable answer
 28596	from her. KarÃ¡gina had replied that for her part she was agreeable, and
 28597	everything depend on her daughterâs inclination. She invited Nicholas
 28598	to come to Moscow.
 28599	
 28600	Several times the countess, with tears in her eyes, told her son that
 28601	now both her daughters were settled, her only wish was to see him
 28602	married. She said she could lie down in her grave peacefully if that
 28603	were accomplished. Then she told him that she knew of a splendid girl
 28604	and tried to discover what he thought about marriage.
 28605	
 28606	At other times she praised Julie to him and advised him to go to
 28607	Moscow during the holidays to amuse himself. Nicholas guessed what his
 28608	motherâs remarks were leading to and during one of these conversations
 28609	induced her to speak quite frankly. She told him that her only hope
 28610	of getting their affairs disentangled now lay in his marrying Julie
 28611	KarÃ¡gina.
 28612	
 28613	âBut, Mamma, suppose I loved a girl who has no fortune, would
 28614	you expect me to sacrifice my feelings and my honor for the sake of
 28615	money?â he asked his mother, not realizing the cruelty of his question
 28616	and only wishing to show his noble-mindedness.
 28617	
 28618	âNo, you have not understood me,â said his mother, not knowing how
 28619	to justify herself. âYou have not understood me, NikÃ³lenka. It is
 28620	your happiness I wish for,â she added, feeling that she was telling an
 28621	untruth and was becoming entangled. She began to cry.
 28622	
 28623	âMamma, donât cry! Only tell me that you wish it, and you know I
 28624	will give my life, anything, to put you at ease,â said Nicholas. âI
 28625	would sacrifice anything for youâeven my feelings.â
 28626	
 28627	But the countess did not want the question put like that: she did not
 28628	want a sacrifice from her son, she herself wished to make a sacrifice
 28629	for him.
 28630	
 28631	âNo, you have not understood me, donât let us talk about it,â she
 28632	replied, wiping away her tears.
 28633	
 28634	âMaybe I do love a poor girl,â said Nicholas to himself. âAm I to
 28635	sacrifice my feelings and my honor for money? I wonder how Mamma could
 28636	speak so to me. Because SÃ³nya is poor I must not love her,â he
 28637	thought, âmust not respond to her faithful, devoted love? Yet I should
 28638	certainly be happier with her than with some doll-like Julie. I can
 28639	always sacrifice my feelings for my familyâs welfare,â he said to
 28640	himself, âbut I canât coerce my feelings. If I love SÃ³nya, that
 28641	feeling is for me stronger and higher than all else.â
 28642	
 28643	Nicholas did not go to Moscow, and the countess did not renew the
 28644	conversation with him about marriage. She saw with sorrow, and sometimes
 28645	with exasperation, symptoms of a growing attachment between her son and
 28646	the portionless SÃ³nya. Though she blamed herself for it, she could
 28647	not refrain from grumbling at and worrying SÃ³nya, often pulling her up
 28648	without reason, addressing her stiffly as âmy dear,â and using the
 28649	formal âyouâ instead of the intimate âthouâ in speaking to her.
 28650	The kindhearted countess was the more vexed with SÃ³nya because that
 28651	poor, dark-eyed niece of hers was so meek, so kind, so devotedly
 28652	grateful to her benefactors, and so faithfully, unchangingly, and
 28653	unselfishly in love with Nicholas, that there were no grounds for
 28654	finding fault with her.
 28655	
 28656	Nicholas was spending the last of his leave at home. A fourth letter had
 28657	come from Prince Andrew, from Rome, in which he wrote that he would have
 28658	been on his way back to Russia long ago had not his wound unexpectedly
 28659	reopened in the warm climate, which obliged him to defer his return till
 28660	the beginning of the new year. NatÃ¡sha was still as much in love with
 28661	her betrothed, found the same comfort in that love, and was still as
 28662	ready to throw herself into all the pleasures of life as before; but at
 28663	the end of the fourth month of their separation she began to have fits
 28664	of depression which she could not master. She felt sorry for herself:
 28665	sorry that she was being wasted all this time and of no use to
 28666	anyoneâwhile she felt herself so capable of loving and being loved.
 28667	
 28668	Things were not cheerful in the RostÃ³vsâ home.
 28669	
 28670	
 28671	
 28672	
 28673	
 28674	CHAPTER IX
 28675	
 28676	Christmas came and except for the ceremonial Mass, the solemn and
 28677	wearisome Christmas congratulations from neighbors and servants, and the
 28678	new dresses everyone put on, there were no special festivities, though
 28679	the calm frost of twenty degrees RÃ©aumur, the dazzling sunshine by day,
 28680	and the starlight of the winter nights seemed to call for some special
 28681	celebration of the season.
 28682	
 28683	On the third day of Christmas week, after the midday dinner, all the
 28684	inmates of the house dispersed to various rooms. It was the dullest time
 28685	of the day. Nicholas, who had been visiting some neighbors that morning,
 28686	was asleep on the sitting-room sofa. The old count was resting in his
 28687	study. SÃ³nya sat in the drawing room at the round table, copying a
 28688	design for embroidery. The countess was playing patience. NastÃ¡sya
 28689	IvÃ¡novna the buffoon sat with a sad face at the window with two old
 28690	ladies. NatÃ¡sha came into the room, went up to SÃ³nya, glanced at
 28691	what she was doing, and then went up to her mother and stood without
 28692	speaking.
 28693	
 28694	âWhy are you wandering about like an outcast?â asked her mother.
 28695	âWhat do you want?â
 28696	
 28697	âHim... I want him... now, this minute! I want him!â said NatÃ¡sha,
 28698	with glittering eyes and no sign of a smile.
 28699	
 28700	The countess lifted her head and looked attentively at her daughter.
 28701	
 28702	âDonât look at me, Mamma! Donât look; I shall cry directly.â
 28703	
 28704	âSit down with me a little,â said the countess.
 28705	
 28706	âMamma, I want him. Why should I be wasted like this, Mamma?â
 28707	
 28708	Her voice broke, tears gushed from her eyes, and she turned quickly to
 28709	hide them and left the room.
 28710	
 28711	She passed into the sitting room, stood there thinking awhile, and then
 28712	went into the maidsâ room. There an old maidservant was grumbling at
 28713	a young girl who stood panting, having just run in through the cold from
 28714	the serfsâ quarters.
 28715	
 28716	âStop playingâthereâs a time for everything,â said the old
 28717	woman.
 28718	
 28719	âLet her alone, KondrÃ¡tevna,â said NatÃ¡sha. âGo, MavrÃºshka,
 28720	go.â
 28721	
 28722	Having released MavrÃºshka, NatÃ¡sha crossed the dancing hall and went
 28723	to the vestibule. There an old footman and two young ones were playing
 28724	cards. They broke off and rose as she entered.
 28725	
 28726	âWhat can I do with them?â thought NatÃ¡sha.
 28727	
 28728	âOh, NikÃ­ta, please go... where can I send him?... Yes, go to the
 28729	yard and fetch a fowl, please, a cock, and you, Misha, bring me some
 28730	oats.â
 28731	
 28732	âJust a few oats?â said Misha, cheerfully and readily.
 28733	
 28734	âGo, go quickly,â the old man urged him.
 28735	
 28736	âAnd you, Theodore, get me a piece of chalk.â
 28737	
 28738	On her way past the butlerâs pantry she told them to set a samovar,
 28739	though it was not at all the time for tea.
 28740	
 28741	FÃ³ka, the butler, was the most ill-tempered person in the house.
 28742	NatÃ¡sha liked to test her power over him. He distrusted the order and
 28743	asked whether the samovar was really wanted.
 28744	
 28745	âOh dear, what a young lady!â said FÃ³ka, pretending to frown at
 28746	NatÃ¡sha.
 28747	
 28748	No one in the house sent people about or gave them as much trouble as
 28749	NatÃ¡sha did. She could not see people unconcernedly, but had to send
 28750	them on some errand. She seemed to be trying whether any of them would
 28751	get angry or sulky with her; but the serfs fulfilled no oneâs orders
 28752	so readily as they did hers. âWhat can I do, where can I go?â
 28753	thought she, as she went slowly along the passage.
 28754	
 28755	âNastÃ¡sya IvÃ¡novna, what sort of children shall I have?â she asked
 28756	the buffoon, who was coming toward her in a womanâs jacket.
 28757	
 28758	âWhy, fleas, crickets, grasshoppers,â answered the buffoon.
 28759	
 28760	âO Lord, O Lord, itâs always the same! Oh, where am I to go? What
 28761	am I to do with myself?â And tapping with her heels, she ran quickly
 28762	upstairs to see Vogel and his wife who lived on the upper story.
 28763	
 28764	Two governesses were sitting with the Vogels at a table, on which were
 28765	plates of raisins, walnuts, and almonds. The governesses were discussing
 28766	whether it was cheaper to live in Moscow or Odessa. NatÃ¡sha sat down,
 28767	listened to their talk with a serious and thoughtful air, and then got
 28768	up again.
 28769	
 28770	âThe island of Madagascar,â she said, âMa-da-gas-car,â she
 28771	repeated, articulating each syllable distinctly, and, not replying to
 28772	Madame Schoss who asked her what she was saying, she went out of the
 28773	room.
 28774	
 28775	Her brother PÃ©tya was upstairs too; with the man in attendance on him
 28776	he was preparing fireworks to let off that night.
 28777	
 28778	âPÃ©tya! PÃ©tya!â she called to him. âCarry me downstairs.â
 28779	
 28780	PÃ©tya ran up and offered her his back. She jumped on it, putting her
 28781	arms round his neck, and he pranced along with her.
 28782	
 28783	âNo, donât... the island of Madagascar!â she said, and jumping off
 28784	his back she went downstairs.
 28785	
 28786	Having as it were reviewed her kingdom, tested her power, and made
 28787	sure that everyone was submissive, but that all the same it was dull,
 28788	NatÃ¡sha betook herself to the ballroom, picked up her guitar, sat down
 28789	in a dark corner behind a bookcase, and began to run her fingers over
 28790	the strings in the bass, picking out a passage she recalled from an
 28791	opera she had heard in Petersburg with Prince Andrew. What she drew from
 28792	the guitar would have had no meaning for other listeners, but in her
 28793	imagination a whole series of reminiscences arose from those sounds.
 28794	She sat behind the bookcase with her eyes fixed on a streak of light
 28795	escaping from the pantry door and listened to herself and pondered. She
 28796	was in a mood for brooding on the past.
 28797	
 28798	SÃ³nya passed to the pantry with a glass in her hand. NatÃ¡sha glanced
 28799	at her and at the crack in the pantry door, and it seemed to her that
 28800	she remembered the light falling through that crack once before and
 28801	SÃ³nya passing with a glass in her hand. âYes it was exactly the
 28802	same,â thought NatÃ¡sha.
 28803	
 28804	âSÃ³nya, what is this?â she cried, twanging a thick string.
 28805	
 28806	âOh, you are there!â said SÃ³nya with a start, and came near and
 28807	listened. âI donât know. A storm?â she ventured timidly, afraid of
 28808	being wrong.
 28809	
 28810	âThere! Thatâs just how she started and just how she came up smiling
 28811	timidly when all this happened before,â thought NatÃ¡sha, âand in
 28812	just the same way I thought there was something lacking in her.â
 28813	
 28814	âNo, itâs the chorus from The Water-Carrier, listen!â and NatÃ¡sha
 28815	sang the air of the chorus so that SÃ³nya should catch it. âWhere were
 28816	you going?â she asked.
 28817	
 28818	âTo change the water in this glass. I am just finishing the design.â
 28819	
 28820	âYou always find something to do, but I canât,â said NatÃ¡sha.
 28821	âAnd whereâs Nicholas?â
 28822	
 28823	âAsleep, I think.â
 28824	
 28825	âSÃ³nya, go and wake him,â said NatÃ¡sha. âTell him I want him to
 28826	come and sing.â
 28827	
 28828	She sat awhile, wondering what the meaning of it all having happened
 28829	before could be, and without solving this problem, or at all regretting
 28830	not having done so, she again passed in fancy to the time when she was
 28831	with him and he was looking at her with a loverâs eyes.
 28832	
 28833	âOh, if only he would come quicker! I am so afraid it will never be!
 28834	And, worst of all, I am growing oldâthatâs the thing! There wonât
 28835	then be in me what there is now. But perhaps heâll come today, will
 28836	come immediately. Perhaps he has come and is sitting in the drawing
 28837	room. Perhaps he came yesterday and I have forgotten it.â She rose,
 28838	put down the guitar, and went to the drawing room.
 28839	
 28840	All the domestic circle, tutors, governesses, and guests, were already
 28841	at the tea table. The servants stood round the tableâbut Prince Andrew
 28842	was not there and life was going on as before.
 28843	
 28844	âAh, here she is!â said the old count, when he saw NatÃ¡sha enter.
 28845	âWell, sit down by me.â But NatÃ¡sha stayed by her mother and
 28846	glanced round as if looking for something.
 28847	
 28848	âMamma!â she muttered, âgive him to me, give him, Mamma, quickly,
 28849	quickly!â and she again had difficulty in repressing her sobs.
 28850	
 28851	She sat down at the table and listened to the conversation between the
 28852	elders and Nicholas, who had also come to the table. âMy God, my God!
 28853	The same faces, the same talk, Papa holding his cup and blowing in the
 28854	same way!â thought NatÃ¡sha, feeling with horror a sense of repulsion
 28855	rising up in her for the whole household, because they were always the
 28856	same.
 28857	
 28858	After tea, Nicholas, SÃ³nya, and NatÃ¡sha went to the sitting room, to
 28859	their favorite corner where their most intimate talks always began.
 28860	
 28861	
 28862	
 28863	
 28864	
 28865	CHAPTER X
 28866	
 28867	âDoes it ever happen to you,â said NatÃ¡sha to her brother, when
 28868	they settled down in the sitting room, âdoes it ever happen to you to
 28869	feel as if there were nothing more to comeânothing; that everything
 28870	good is past? And to feel not exactly dull, but sad?â
 28871	
 28872	âI should think so!â he replied. âI have felt like that when
 28873	everything was all right and everyone was cheerful. The thought has come
 28874	into my mind that I was already tired of it all, and that we must all
 28875	die. Once in the regiment I had not gone to some merrymaking where there
 28876	was music... and suddenly I felt so depressed...â
 28877	
 28878	âOh yes, I know, I know, I know!â NatÃ¡sha interrupted him. âWhen
 28879	I was quite little that used to be so with me. Do you remember when
 28880	I was punished once about some plums? You were all dancing, and I sat
 28881	sobbing in the schoolroom? I shall never forget it: I felt sad and sorry
 28882	for everyone, for myself, and for everyone. And I was innocentâthat
 28883	was the chief thing,â said NatÃ¡sha. âDo you remember?â
 28884	
 28885	âI remember,â answered Nicholas. âI remember that I came to you
 28886	afterwards and wanted to comfort you, but do you know, I felt ashamed
 28887	to. We were terribly absurd. I had a funny doll then and wanted to give
 28888	it to you. Do you remember?â
 28889	
 28890	âAnd do you remember,â NatÃ¡sha asked with a pensive smile, âhow
 28891	once, long, long ago, when we were quite little, Uncle called us into
 28892	the studyâthat was in the old houseâand it was darkâwe went in and
 28893	suddenly there stood...â
 28894	
 28895	âA Negro,â chimed in Nicholas with a smile of delight. âOf course
 28896	I remember. Even now I donât know whether there really was a Negro, or
 28897	if we only dreamed it or were told about him.â
 28898	
 28899	âHe was gray, you remember, and had white teeth, and stood and looked
 28900	at us....â
 28901	
 28902	âSÃ³nya, do you remember?â asked Nicholas.
 28903	
 28904	âYes, yes, I do remember something too,â SÃ³nya answered timidly.
 28905	
 28906	âYou know I have asked Papa and Mamma about that Negro,â said
 28907	NatÃ¡sha, âand they say there was no Negro at all. But you see, you
 28908	remember!â
 28909	
 28910	âOf course I do, I remember his teeth as if I had just seen them.â
 28911	
 28912	âHow strange it is! Itâs as if it were a dream! I like that.â
 28913	
 28914	âAnd do you remember how we rolled hard-boiled eggs in the ballroom,
 28915	and suddenly two old women began spinning round on the carpet? Was that
 28916	real or not? Do you remember what fun it was?â
 28917	
 28918	âYes, and you remember how Papa in his blue overcoat fired a gun in
 28919	the porch?â
 28920	
 28921	So they went through their memories, smiling with pleasure: not the sad
 28922	memories of old age, but poetic, youthful onesâthose impressions of
 28923	oneâs most distant past in which dreams and realities blendâand they
 28924	laughed with quiet enjoyment.
 28925	
 28926	SÃ³nya, as always, did not quite keep pace with them, though they shared
 28927	the same reminiscences.
 28928	
 28929	Much that they remembered had slipped from her mind, and what she
 28930	recalled did not arouse the same poetic feeling as they experienced. She
 28931	simply enjoyed their pleasure and tried to fit in with it.
 28932	
 28933	She only really took part when they recalled SÃ³nyaâs first arrival.
 28934	She told them how afraid she had been of Nicholas because he had on a
 28935	corded jacket and her nurse had told her that she, too, would be sewn up
 28936	with cords.
 28937	
 28938	âAnd I remember their telling me that you had been born under a
 28939	cabbage,â said NatÃ¡sha, âand I remember that I dared not disbelieve
 28940	it then, but knew that it was not true, and I felt so uncomfortable.â
 28941	
 28942	While they were talking a maid thrust her head in at the other door of
 28943	the sitting room.
 28944	
 28945	âThey have brought the cock, Miss,â she said in a whisper.
 28946	
 28947	âIt isnât wanted, PÃ³lya. Tell them to take it away,â replied
 28948	NatÃ¡sha.
 28949	
 28950	In the middle of their talk in the sitting room, Dimmler came in and
 28951	went up to the harp that stood there in a corner. He took off its cloth
 28952	covering, and the harp gave out a jarring sound.
 28953	
 28954	âMr. Dimmler, please play my favorite nocturne by Field,â came the
 28955	old countessâ voice from the drawing room.
 28956	
 28957	Dimmler struck a chord and, turning to NatÃ¡sha, Nicholas, and SÃ³nya,
 28958	remarked: âHow quiet you young people are!â
 28959	
 28960	âYes, weâre philosophizing,â said NatÃ¡sha, glancing round for a
 28961	moment and then continuing the conversation. They were now discussing
 28962	dreams.
 28963	
 28964	Dimmler began to play; NatÃ¡sha went on tiptoe noiselessly to the table,
 28965	took up a candle, carried it out, and returned, seating herself quietly
 28966	in her former place. It was dark in the room especially where they were
 28967	sitting on the sofa, but through the big windows the silvery light of
 28968	the full moon fell on the floor. Dimmler had finished the piece but
 28969	still sat softly running his fingers over the strings, evidently
 28970	uncertain whether to stop or to play something else.
 28971	
 28972	âDo you know,â said NatÃ¡sha in a whisper, moving closer to Nicholas
 28973	and SÃ³nya, âthat when one goes on and on recalling memories, one at
 28974	last begins to remember what happened before one was in the world....â
 28975	
 28976	âThat is metempsychosis,â said SÃ³nya, who had always learned well,
 28977	and remembered everything. âThe Egyptians believed that our souls have
 28978	lived in animals, and will go back into animals again.â
 28979	
 28980	âNo, I donât believe we ever were in animals,â said NatÃ¡sha,
 28981	still in a whisper though the music had ceased. âBut I am certain that
 28982	we were angels somewhere there, and have been here, and that is why we
 28983	remember....â
 28984	
 28985	âMay I join you?â said Dimmler who had come up quietly, and he sat
 28986	down by them.
 28987	
 28988	âIf we have been angels, why have we fallen lower?â said Nicholas.
 28989	âNo, that canât be!â
 28990	
 28991	âNot lower, who said we were lower?... How do I know what I
 28992	was before?â NatÃ¡sha rejoined with conviction. âThe soul is
 28993	immortalâwell then, if I shall always live I must have lived before,
 28994	lived for a whole eternity.â
 28995	
 28996	âYes, but it is hard for us to imagine eternity,â remarked Dimmler,
 28997	who had joined the young folk with a mildly condescending smile but now
 28998	spoke as quietly and seriously as they.
 28999	
 29000	âWhy is it hard to imagine eternity?â said NatÃ¡sha. âIt is now
 29001	today, and it will be tomorrow, and always; and there was yesterday, and
 29002	the day before....â
 29003	
 29004	âNatÃ¡sha! Now itâs your turn. Sing me something,â they heard the
 29005	countess say. âWhy are you sitting there like conspirators?â
 29006	
 29007	âMamma, I donât at all want to,â replied NatÃ¡sha, but all the
 29008	same she rose.
 29009	
 29010	None of them, not even the middle-aged Dimmler, wanted to break off
 29011	their conversation and quit that corner in the sitting room, but
 29012	NatÃ¡sha got up and Nicholas sat down at the clavichord. Standing
 29013	as usual in the middle of the hall and choosing the place where the
 29014	resonance was best, NatÃ¡sha began to sing her motherâs favorite song.
 29015	
 29016	She had said she did not want to sing, but it was long since she had
 29017	sung, and long before she again sang, as she did that evening. The
 29018	count, from his study where he was talking to MÃ­tenka, heard her and,
 29019	like a schoolboy in a hurry to run out to play, blundered in his talk
 29020	while giving orders to the steward, and at last stopped, while MÃ­tenka
 29021	stood in front of him also listening and smiling. Nicholas did not take
 29022	his eyes off his sister and drew breath in time with her. SÃ³nya, as she
 29023	listened, thought of the immense difference there was between herself
 29024	and her friend, and how impossible it was for her to be anything like as
 29025	bewitching as her cousin. The old countess sat with a blissful yet sad
 29026	smile and with tears in her eyes, occasionally shaking her head. She
 29027	thought of NatÃ¡sha and of her own youth, and of how there was something
 29028	unnatural and dreadful in this impending marriage of NatÃ¡sha and Prince
 29029	Andrew.
 29030	
 29031	Dimmler, who had seated himself beside the countess, listened with
 29032	closed eyes.
 29033	
 29034	âAh, Countess,â he said at last, âthatâs a European talent, she
 29035	has nothing to learnâwhat softness, tenderness, and strength....â
 29036	
 29037	âAh, how afraid I am for her, how afraid I am!â said the countess,
 29038	not realizing to whom she was speaking. Her maternal instinct told her
 29039	that NatÃ¡sha had too much of something, and that because of this
 29040	she would not be happy. Before NatÃ¡sha had finished singing,
 29041	fourteen-year-old PÃ©tya rushed in delightedly, to say that some mummers
 29042	had arrived.
 29043	
 29044	NatÃ¡sha stopped abruptly.
 29045	
 29046	âIdiot!â she screamed at her brother and, running to a chair, threw
 29047	herself on it, sobbing so violently that she could not stop for a long
 29048	time.
 29049	
 29050	âItâs nothing, Mamma, really itâs nothing; only PÃ©tya startled
 29051	me,â she said, trying to smile, but her tears still flowed and sobs
 29052	still choked her.
 29053	
 29054	The mummers (some of the house serfs) dressed up as bears, Turks,
 29055	innkeepers, and ladiesâfrightening and funnyâbringing in with
 29056	them the cold from outside and a feeling of gaiety, crowded, at first
 29057	timidly, into the anteroom, then hiding behind one another they pushed
 29058	into the ballroom where, shyly at first and then more and more merrily
 29059	and heartily, they started singing, dancing, and playing Christmas
 29060	games. The countess, when she had identified them and laughed at their
 29061	costumes, went into the drawing room. The count sat in the ballroom,
 29062	smiling radiantly and applauding the players. The young people had
 29063	disappeared.
 29064	
 29065	Half an hour later there appeared among the other mummers in the
 29066	ballroom an old lady in a hooped skirtâthis was Nicholas. A Turkish
 29067	girl was PÃ©tya. A clown was Dimmler. An hussar was NatÃ¡sha, and a
 29068	Circassian was SÃ³nya with burnt-cork mustache and eyebrows.
 29069	
 29070	After the condescending surprise, nonrecognition, and praise, from those
 29071	who were not themselves dressed up, the young people decided that their
 29072	costumes were so good that they ought to be shown elsewhere.
 29073	
 29074	Nicholas, who, as the roads were in splendid condition, wanted to take
 29075	them all for a drive in his troyka, proposed to take with them about a
 29076	dozen of the serf mummers and drive to âUncleâs.â
 29077	
 29078	âNo, why disturb the old fellow?â said the countess. âBesides,
 29079	you wouldnât have room to turn round there. If you must go, go to the
 29080	MelyukÃ³vsâ.â
 29081	
 29082	MelyukÃ³va was a widow, who, with her family and their tutors and
 29083	governesses, lived three miles from the RostÃ³vs.
 29084	
 29085	âThatâs right, my dear,â chimed in the old count, thoroughly
 29086	aroused. âIâll dress up at once and go with them. Iâll make
 29087	Pashette open her eyes.â
 29088	
 29089	But the countess would not agree to his going; he had had a bad leg all
 29090	these last days. It was decided that the count must not go, but that if
 29091	Louisa IvÃ¡novna (Madame Schoss) would go with them, the young ladies
 29092	might go to the MelyukÃ³vsâ, SÃ³nya, generally so timid and shy, more
 29093	urgently than anyone begging Louisa IvÃ¡novna not to refuse.
 29094	
 29095	SÃ³nyaâs costume was the best of all. Her mustache and eyebrows were
 29096	extraordinarily becoming. Everyone told her she looked very handsome,
 29097	and she was in a spirited and energetic mood unusual with her. Some
 29098	inner voice told her that now or never her fate would be decided, and
 29099	in her male attire she seemed quite a different person. Louisa IvÃ¡novna
 29100	consented to go, and in half an hour four troyka sleighs with large and
 29101	small bells, their runners squeaking and whistling over the frozen snow,
 29102	drove up to the porch.
 29103	
 29104	NatÃ¡sha was foremost in setting a merry holiday tone, which, passing
 29105	from one to another, grew stronger and reached its climax when they all
 29106	came out into the frost and got into the sleighs, talking, calling to
 29107	one another, laughing, and shouting.
 29108	
 29109	Two of the troykas were the usual household sleighs, the third was the
 29110	old countâs with a trotter from the OrlÃ³v stud as shaft horse,
 29111	the fourth was Nicholasâ own with a short shaggy black shaft horse.
 29112	Nicholas, in his old ladyâs dress over which he had belted his hussar
 29113	overcoat, stood in the middle of the sleigh, reins in hand.
 29114	
 29115	It was so light that he could see the moonlight reflected from the metal
 29116	harness disks and from the eyes of the horses, who looked round in alarm
 29117	at the noisy party under the shadow of the porch roof.
 29118	
 29119	NatÃ¡sha, SÃ³nya, Madame Schoss, and two maids got into Nicholasâ
 29120	sleigh; Dimmler, his wife, and PÃ©tya, into the old countâs, and the
 29121	rest of the mummers seated themselves in the other two sleighs.
 29122	
 29123	âYou go ahead, ZakhÃ¡r!â shouted Nicholas to his fatherâs
 29124	coachman, wishing for a chance to race past him.
 29125	
 29126	The old countâs troyka, with Dimmler and his party, started forward,
 29127	squeaking on its runners as though freezing to the snow, its deep-toned
 29128	bell clanging. The side horses, pressing against the shafts of the
 29129	middle horse, sank in the snow, which was dry and glittered like sugar,
 29130	and threw it up.
 29131	
 29132	Nicholas set off, following the first sleigh; behind him the others
 29133	moved noisily, their runners squeaking. At first they drove at a steady
 29134	trot along the narrow road. While they drove past the garden the shadows
 29135	of the bare trees often fell across the road and hid the brilliant
 29136	moonlight, but as soon as they were past the fence, the snowy plain
 29137	bathed in moonlight and motionless spread out before them glittering
 29138	like diamonds and dappled with bluish shadows. Bang, bang! went the
 29139	first sleigh over a cradle hole in the snow of the road, and each of
 29140	the other sleighs jolted in the same way, and rudely breaking the
 29141	frost-bound stillness, the troykas began to speed along the road, one
 29142	after the other.
 29143	
 29144	âA hareâs track, a lot of tracks!â rang out NatÃ¡shaâs voice
 29145	through the frost-bound air.
 29146	
 29147	âHow light it is, Nicholas!â came SÃ³nyaâs voice.
 29148	
 29149	Nicholas glanced round at SÃ³nya, and bent down to see her face closer.
 29150	Quite a new, sweet face with black eyebrows and mustaches peeped up
 29151	at him from her sable fursâso close and yet so distantâin the
 29152	moonlight.
 29153	
 29154	âThat used to be SÃ³nya,â thought he, and looked at her closer and
 29155	smiled.
 29156	
 29157	âWhat is it, Nicholas?â
 29158	
 29159	âNothing,â said he and turned again to the horses.
 29160	
 29161	When they came out onto the beaten highroadâpolished by sleigh runners
 29162	and cut up by rough-shod hoofs, the marks of which were visible in the
 29163	moonlightâthe horses began to tug at the reins of their own accord and
 29164	increased their pace. The near side horse, arching his head and breaking
 29165	into a short canter, tugged at his traces. The shaft horse swayed from
 29166	side to side, moving his ears as if asking: âIsnât it time to begin
 29167	now?â In front, already far ahead the deep bell of the sleigh ringing
 29168	farther and farther off, the black horses driven by ZakhÃ¡r could be
 29169	clearly seen against the white snow. From that sleigh one could hear the
 29170	shouts, laughter, and voices of the mummers.
 29171	
 29172	âGee up, my darlings!â shouted Nicholas, pulling the reins to one
 29173	side and flourishing the whip.
 29174	
 29175	It was only by the keener wind that met them and the jerks given by the
 29176	side horses who pulled harderâever increasing their gallopâthat
 29177	one noticed how fast the troyka was flying. Nicholas looked back. With
 29178	screams, squeals, and waving of whips that caused even the shaft horses
 29179	to gallopâthe other sleighs followed. The shaft horse swung steadily
 29180	beneath the bow over its head, with no thought of slackening pace and
 29181	ready to put on speed when required.
 29182	
 29183	Nicholas overtook the first sleigh. They were driving downhill and
 29184	coming out upon a broad trodden track across a meadow, near a river.
 29185	
 29186	âWhere are we?â thought he. âItâs the KosÃ³y meadow, I suppose.
 29187	But noâthis is something new Iâve never seen before. This isnât
 29188	the KosÃ³y meadow nor the DÃ«mkin hill, and heaven only knows what it
 29189	is! It is something new and enchanted. Well, whatever it may be...â
 29190	And shouting to his horses, he began to pass the first sleigh.
 29191	
 29192	ZakhÃ¡r held back his horses and turned his face, which was already
 29193	covered with hoarfrost to his eyebrows.
 29194	
 29195	Nicholas gave the horses the rein, and ZakhÃ¡r, stretching out his arms,
 29196	clucked his tongue and let his horses go.
 29197	
 29198	âNow, look out, master!â he cried.
 29199	
 29200	Faster still the two troykas flew side by side, and faster moved
 29201	the feet of the galloping side horses. Nicholas began to draw ahead.
 29202	ZakhÃ¡r, while still keeping his arms extended, raised one hand with the
 29203	reins.
 29204	
 29205	âNo you wonât, master!â he shouted.
 29206	
 29207	Nicholas put all his horses to a gallop and passed ZakhÃ¡r. The horses
 29208	showered the fine dry snow on the faces of those in the sleighâbeside
 29209	them sounded quick ringing bells and they caught confused glimpses of
 29210	swiftly moving legs and the shadows of the troyka they were passing.
 29211	The whistling sound of the runners on the snow and the voices of girls
 29212	shrieking were heard from different sides.
 29213	
 29214	Again checking his horses, Nicholas looked around him. They were still
 29215	surrounded by the magic plain bathed in moonlight and spangled with
 29216	stars.
 29217	
 29218	âZakhÃ¡r is shouting that I should turn to the left, but why to the
 29219	left?â thought Nicholas. âAre we getting to the MelyukÃ³vsâ? Is
 29220	this MelyukÃ³vka? Heaven only knows where we are going, and heaven knows
 29221	what is happening to usâbut it is very strange and pleasant whatever
 29222	it is.â And he looked round in the sleigh.
 29223	
 29224	âLook, his mustache and eyelashes are all white!â said one of the
 29225	strange, pretty, unfamiliar peopleâthe one with fine eyebrows and
 29226	mustache.
 29227	
 29228	âI think this used to be NatÃ¡sha,â thought Nicholas, âand that
 29229	was Madame Schoss, but perhaps itâs not, and this Circassian with the
 29230	mustache I donât know, but I love her.â
 29231	
 29232	âArenât you cold?â he asked.
 29233	
 29234	They did not answer but began to laugh. Dimmler from the sleigh behind
 29235	shouted somethingâprobably something funnyâbut they could not make
 29236	out what he said.
 29237	
 29238	âYes, yes!â some voices answered, laughing.
 29239	
 29240	âBut here was a fairy forest with black moving shadows, and a glitter
 29241	of diamonds and a flight of marble steps and the silver roofs of fairy
 29242	buildings and the shrill yells of some animals. And if this is really
 29243	MelyukÃ³vka, it is still stranger that we drove heaven knows where and
 29244	have come to MelyukÃ³vka,â thought Nicholas.
 29245	
 29246	It really was MelyukÃ³vka, and maids and footmen with merry faces came
 29247	running, out to the porch carrying candles.
 29248	
 29249	âWho is it?â asked someone in the porch.
 29250	
 29251	âThe mummers from the countâs. I know by the horses,â replied some
 29252	voices.
 29253	
 29254	
 29255	
 29256	
 29257	
 29258	CHAPTER XI
 29259	
 29260	PelagÃ©ya DanÃ­lovna MelyukÃ³va, a broadly built, energetic woman
 29261	wearing spectacles, sat in the drawing room in a loose dress, surrounded
 29262	by her daughters whom she was trying to keep from feeling dull. They
 29263	were quietly dropping melted wax into snow and looking at the shadows
 29264	the wax figures would throw on the wall, when they heard the steps and
 29265	voices of new arrivals in the vestibule.
 29266	
 29267	Hussars, ladies, witches, clowns, and bears, after clearing their
 29268	throats and wiping the hoarfrost from their faces in the vestibule,
 29269	came into the ballroom where candles were hurriedly lighted. The
 29270	clownâDimmlerâand the ladyâNicholasâstarted a dance. Surrounded
 29271	by the screaming children the mummers, covering their faces and
 29272	disguising their voices, bowed to their hostess and arranged themselves
 29273	about the room.
 29274	
 29275	âDear me! thereâs no recognizing them! And NatÃ¡sha! See whom
 29276	she looks like! She really reminds me of somebody. But Herr
 29277	Dimmlerâisnât he good! I didnât know him! And how he dances. Dear
 29278	me, thereâs a Circassian. Really, how becoming it is to dear SÃ³nya.
 29279	And who is that? Well, you have cheered us up! NikÃ­ta and Vanyaâclear
 29280	away the tables! And we were sitting so quietly. Ha, ha, ha!... The
 29281	hussar, the hussar! Just like a boy! And the legs!... I canât look at
 29282	him...â different voices were saying.
 29283	
 29284	NatÃ¡sha, the young MelyukÃ³vsâ favorite, disappeared with them into
 29285	the back rooms where a cork and various dressing gowns and male garments
 29286	were called for and received from the footman by bare girlish arms from
 29287	behind the door. Ten minutes later, all the young MelyukÃ³vs joined the
 29288	mummers.
 29289	
 29290	PelagÃ©ya DanÃ­lovna, having given orders to clear the rooms for the
 29291	visitors and arranged about refreshments for the gentry and the serfs,
 29292	went about among the mummers without removing her spectacles, peering
 29293	into their faces with a suppressed smile and failing to recognize any
 29294	of them. It was not merely Dimmler and the RostÃ³vs she failed to
 29295	recognize, she did not even recognize her own daughters, or her late
 29296	husbandâs, dressing gowns and uniforms, which they had put on.
 29297	
 29298	âAnd who is this?â she asked her governess, peering into the face of
 29299	her own daughter dressed up as a KazÃ¡n-Tartar. âI suppose it is one
 29300	of the RostÃ³vs! Well, Mr. Hussar, and what regiment do you serve in?â
 29301	she asked NatÃ¡sha. âHere, hand some fruit jelly to the Turk!â
 29302	she ordered the butler who was handing things round. âThatâs not
 29303	forbidden by his law.â
 29304	
 29305	Sometimes, as she looked at the strange but amusing capers cut by the
 29306	dancers, whoâhaving decided once for all that being disguised, no one
 29307	would recognize themâwere not at all shy, PelagÃ©ya DanÃ­lovna hid
 29308	her face in her handkerchief, and her whole stout body shook with
 29309	irrepressible, kindly, elderly laughter.
 29310	
 29311	âMy little SÃ¡sha! Look at SÃ¡sha!â she said.
 29312	
 29313	After Russian country dances and chorus dances, PelagÃ©ya DanÃ­lovna
 29314	made the serfs and gentry join in one large circle: a ring, a string,
 29315	and a silver ruble were fetched and they all played games together.
 29316	
 29317	In an hour, all the costumes were crumpled and disordered. The corked
 29318	eyebrows and mustaches were smeared over the perspiring, flushed,
 29319	and merry faces. PelagÃ©ya DanÃ­lovna began to recognize the mummers,
 29320	admired their cleverly contrived costumes, and particularly how they
 29321	suited the young ladies, and she thanked them all for having entertained
 29322	her so well. The visitors were invited to supper in the drawing room,
 29323	and the serfs had something served to them in the ballroom.
 29324	
 29325	âNow to tell oneâs fortune in the empty bathhouse is frightening!â
 29326	said an old maid who lived with the MelyukÃ³vs, during supper.
 29327	
 29328	âWhy?â said the eldest MelyukÃ³v girl.
 29329	
 29330	âYou wouldnât go, it takes courage....â
 29331	
 29332	âIâll go,â said SÃ³nya.
 29333	
 29334	âTell what happened to the young lady!â said the second MelyukÃ³v
 29335	girl.
 29336	
 29337	âWell,â began the old maid, âa young lady once went out, took a
 29338	cock, laid the table for two, all properly, and sat down. After sitting
 29339	a while, she suddenly hears someone coming... a sleigh drives up with
 29340	harness bells; she hears him coming! He comes in, just in the shape of a
 29341	man, like an officerâcomes in and sits down to table with her.â
 29342	
 29343	âAh! ah!â screamed NatÃ¡sha, rolling her eyes with horror.
 29344	
 29345	âYes? And how... did he speak?â
 29346	
 29347	âYes, like a man. Everything quite all right, and he began persuading
 29348	her; and she should have kept him talking till cockcrow, but she got
 29349	frightened, just got frightened and hid her face in her hands. Then he
 29350	caught her up. It was lucky the maids ran in just then....â
 29351	
 29352	âNow, why frighten them?â said PelagÃ©ya DanÃ­lovna.
 29353	
 29354	âMamma, you used to try your fate yourself...â said her daughter.
 29355	
 29356	âAnd how does one do it in a barn?â inquired SÃ³nya.
 29357	
 29358	âWell, say you went to the barn now, and listened. It depends on what
 29359	you hear; hammering and knockingâthatâs bad; but a sound of shifting
 29360	grain is good and one sometimes hears that, too.â
 29361	
 29362	âMamma, tell us what happened to you in the barn.â
 29363	
 29364	PelagÃ©ya DanÃ­lovna smiled.
 29365	
 29366	âOh, Iâve forgotten...â she replied. âBut none of you would
 29367	go?â
 29368	
 29369	âYes, I will; PelagÃ©ya DanÃ­lovna, let me! Iâll go,â said SÃ³nya.
 29370	
 29371	âWell, why not, if youâre not afraid?â
 29372	
 29373	âLouisa IvÃ¡novna, may I?â asked SÃ³nya.
 29374	
 29375	Whether they were playing the ring and string game or the ruble game or
 29376	talking as now, Nicholas did not leave SÃ³nyaâs side, and gazed at her
 29377	with quite new eyes. It seemed to him that it was only today, thanks
 29378	to that burnt-cork mustache, that he had fully learned to know her. And
 29379	really, that evening, SÃ³nya was brighter, more animated, and prettier
 29380	than Nicholas had ever seen her before.
 29381	
 29382	âSo thatâs what she is like; what a fool I have been!â he thought
 29383	gazing at her sparkling eyes, and under the mustache a happy rapturous
 29384	smile dimpled her cheeks, a smile he had never seen before.
 29385	
 29386	âIâm not afraid of anything,â said SÃ³nya. âMay I go at once?â
 29387	She got up.
 29388	
 29389	They told her where the barn was and how she should stand and listen,
 29390	and they handed her a fur cloak. She threw this over her head and
 29391	shoulders and glanced at Nicholas.
 29392	
 29393	âWhat a darling that girl is!â thought he. âAnd what have I been
 29394	thinking of till now?â
 29395	
 29396	SÃ³nya went out into the passage to go to the barn. Nicholas went
 29397	hastily to the front porch, saying he felt too hot. The crowd of people
 29398	really had made the house stuffy.
 29399	
 29400	Outside, there was the same cold stillness and the same moon, but even
 29401	brighter than before. The light was so strong and the snow sparkled with
 29402	so many stars that one did not wish to look up at the sky and the real
 29403	stars were unnoticed. The sky was black and dreary, while the earth was
 29404	gay.
 29405	
 29406	âI am a fool, a fool! what have I been waiting for?â thought
 29407	Nicholas, and running out from the porch he went round the corner of
 29408	the house and along the path that led to the back porch. He knew SÃ³nya
 29409	would pass that way. Halfway lay some snow-covered piles of firewood and
 29410	across and along them a network of shadows from the bare old lime trees
 29411	fell on the snow and on the path. This path led to the barn. The log
 29412	walls of the barn and its snow-covered roof, that looked as if hewn out
 29413	of some precious stone, sparkled in the moonlight. A tree in the garden
 29414	snapped with the frost, and then all was again perfectly silent. His
 29415	bosom seemed to inhale not air but the strength of eternal youth and
 29416	gladness.
 29417	
 29418	From the back porch came the sound of feet descending the steps, the
 29419	bottom step upon which snow had fallen gave a ringing creak and he heard
 29420	the voice of an old maidservant saying, âStraight, straight, along the
 29421	path, Miss. Only, donât look back.â
 29422	
 29423	âI am not afraid,â answered SÃ³nyaâs voice, and along the path
 29424	toward Nicholas came the crunching, whistling sound of SÃ³nyaâs feet
 29425	in her thin shoes.
 29426	
 29427	SÃ³nya came along, wrapped in her cloak. She was only a couple of paces
 29428	away when she saw him, and to her too he was not the Nicholas she had
 29429	known and always slightly feared. He was in a womanâs dress, with
 29430	tousled hair and a happy smile new to SÃ³nya. She ran rapidly toward
 29431	him.
 29432	
 29433	âQuite different and yet the same,â thought Nicholas, looking at her
 29434	face all lit up by the moonlight. He slipped his arms under the cloak
 29435	that covered her head, embraced her, pressed her to him, and kissed her
 29436	on the lips that wore a mustache and had a smell of burnt cork. SÃ³nya
 29437	kissed him full on the lips, and disengaging her little hands pressed
 29438	them to his cheeks.
 29439	
 29440	âSÃ³nya!... Nicholas!â... was all they said. They ran to the barn
 29441	and then back again, re-entering, he by the front and she by the back
 29442	porch.
 29443	
 29444	
 29445	
 29446	
 29447	
 29448	CHAPTER XII
 29449	
 29450	When they all drove back from PelagÃ©ya DanÃ­lovnaâs, NatÃ¡sha, who
 29451	always saw and noticed everything, arranged that she and Madame Schoss
 29452	should go back in the sleigh with Dimmler, and SÃ³nya with Nicholas and
 29453	the maids.
 29454	
 29455	On the way back Nicholas drove at a steady pace instead of racing and
 29456	kept peering by that fantastic all-transforming light into SÃ³nyaâs
 29457	face and searching beneath the eyebrows and mustache for his former and
 29458	his present SÃ³nya from whom he had resolved never to be parted again.
 29459	He looked and recognizing in her both the old and the new SÃ³nya, and
 29460	being reminded by the smell of burnt cork of the sensation of her kiss,
 29461	inhaled the frosty air with a full breast and, looking at the ground
 29462	flying beneath him and at the sparkling sky, felt himself again in
 29463	fairyland.
 29464	
 29465	âSÃ³nya, is it well with thee?â he asked from time to time.
 29466	
 29467	âYes!â she replied. âAnd with thee?â
 29468	
 29469	When halfway home Nicholas handed the reins to the coachman and ran for
 29470	a moment to NatÃ¡shaâs sleigh and stood on its wing.
 29471	
 29472	âNatÃ¡sha!â he whispered in French, âdo you know I have made up my
 29473	mind about SÃ³nya?â
 29474	
 29475	âHave you told her?â asked NatÃ¡sha, suddenly beaming all over with
 29476	joy.
 29477	
 29478	âOh, how strange you are with that mustache and those eyebrows!...
 29479	NatÃ¡shaâare you glad?â
 29480	
 29481	âI am so glad, so glad! I was beginning to be vexed with you. I did
 29482	not tell you, but you have been treating her badly. What a heart she
 29483	has, Nicholas! I am horrid sometimes, but I was ashamed to be happy
 29484	while SÃ³nya was not,â continued NatÃ¡sha. âNow I am so glad! Well,
 29485	run back to her.â
 29486	
 29487	âNo, wait a bit.... Oh, how funny you look!â cried Nicholas, peering
 29488	into her face and finding in his sister too something new, unusual, and
 29489	bewitchingly tender that he had not seen in her before. âNatÃ¡sha,
 29490	itâs magical, isnât it?â
 29491	
 29492	âYes,â she replied. âYou have done splendidly.â
 29493	
 29494	âHad I seen her before as she is now,â thought Nicholas, âI should
 29495	long ago have asked her what to do and have done whatever she told me,
 29496	and all would have been well.â
 29497	
 29498	âSo you are glad and I have done right?â
 29499	
 29500	âOh, quite right! I had a quarrel with Mamma some time ago about it.
 29501	Mamma said she was angling for you. How could she say such a thing! I
 29502	nearly stormed at Mamma. I will never let anyone say anything bad of
 29503	SÃ³nya, for there is nothing but good in her.â
 29504	
 29505	âThen itâs all right?â said Nicholas, again scrutinizing the
 29506	expression of his sisterâs face to see if she was in earnest. Then he
 29507	jumped down and, his boots scrunching the snow, ran back to his sleigh.
 29508	The same happy, smiling Circassian, with mustache and beaming eyes
 29509	looking up from under a sable hood, was still sitting there, and that
 29510	Circassian was SÃ³nya, and that SÃ³nya was certainly his future happy
 29511	and loving wife.
 29512	
 29513	When they reached home and had told their mother how they had spent the
 29514	evening at the MelyukÃ³vsâ, the girls went to their bedroom. When they
 29515	had undressed, but without washing off the cork mustaches, they sat a
 29516	long time talking of their happiness. They talked of how they would live
 29517	when they were married, how their husbands would be friends, and how
 29518	happy they would be. On NatÃ¡shaâs table stood two looking glasses
 29519	which DunyÃ¡sha had prepared beforehand.
 29520	
 29521	âOnly when will all that be? I am afraid never.... It would be too
 29522	good!â said NatÃ¡sha, rising and going to the looking glasses.
 29523	
 29524	âSit down, NatÃ¡sha; perhaps youâll see him,â said SÃ³nya.
 29525	
 29526	NatÃ¡sha lit the candles, one on each side of one of the looking
 29527	glasses, and sat down.
 29528	
 29529	âI see someone with a mustache,â said NatÃ¡sha, seeing her own face.
 29530	
 29531	âYou mustnât laugh, Miss,â said DunyÃ¡sha.
 29532	
 29533	With SÃ³nyaâs help and the maidâs, NatÃ¡sha got the glass she held
 29534	into the right position opposite the other; her face assumed a serious
 29535	expression and she sat silent. She sat a long time looking at the
 29536	receding line of candles reflected in the glasses and expecting (from
 29537	tales she had heard) to see a coffin, or him, Prince Andrew, in that
 29538	last dim, indistinctly outlined square. But ready as she was to take the
 29539	smallest speck for the image of a man or of a coffin, she saw nothing.
 29540	She began blinking rapidly and moved away from the looking glasses.
 29541	
 29542	âWhy is it others see things and I donât?â she said. âYou sit
 29543	down now, SÃ³nya. You absolutely must, tonight! Do it for me.... Today I
 29544	feel so frightened!â
 29545	
 29546	SÃ³nya sat down before the glasses, got the right position, and began
 29547	looking.
 29548	
 29549	âNow, Miss SÃ³nya is sure to see something,â whispered DunyÃ¡sha;
 29550	âwhile you do nothing but laugh.â
 29551	
 29552	SÃ³nya heard this and NatÃ¡shaâs whisper:
 29553	
 29554	âI know she will. She saw something last year.â
 29555	
 29556	For about three minutes all were silent.
 29557	
 29558	âOf course she will!â whispered NatÃ¡sha, but did not finish...
 29559	suddenly SÃ³nya pushed away the glass she was holding and covered her
 29560	eyes with her hand.
 29561	
 29562	âOh, NatÃ¡sha!â she cried.
 29563	
 29564	âDid you see? Did you? What was it?â exclaimed NatÃ¡sha, holding up
 29565	the looking glass.
 29566	
 29567	SÃ³nya had not seen anything, she was just wanting to blink and to get
 29568	up when she heard NatÃ¡sha say, âOf course she will!â She did not
 29569	wish to disappoint either DunyÃ¡sha or NatÃ¡sha, but it was hard to sit
 29570	still. She did not herself know how or why the exclamation escaped her
 29571	when she covered her eyes.
 29572	
 29573	âYou saw him?â urged NatÃ¡sha, seizing her hand.
 29574	
 29575	âYes. Wait a bit... I... saw him,â SÃ³nya could not help saying, not
 29576	yet knowing whom NatÃ¡sha meant by him, Nicholas or Prince Andrew.
 29577	
 29578	âBut why shouldnât I say I saw something? Others do see! Besides who
 29579	can tell whether I saw anything or not?â flashed through SÃ³nyaâs
 29580	mind.
 29581	
 29582	âYes, I saw him,â she said.
 29583	
 29584	âHow? Standing or lying?â
 29585	
 29586	âNo, I saw... At first there was nothing, then I saw him lying
 29587	down.â
 29588	
 29589	âAndrew lying? Is he ill?â asked NatÃ¡sha, her frightened eyes fixed
 29590	on her friend.
 29591	
 29592	âNo, on the contrary, on the contrary! His face was cheerful, and he
 29593	turned to me.â And when saying this she herself fancied she had really
 29594	seen what she described.
 29595	
 29596	âWell, and then, SÃ³nya?...â
 29597	
 29598	âAfter that, I could not make out what there was; something blue and
 29599	red....â
 29600	
 29601	âSÃ³nya! When will he come back? When shall I see him! O, God, how
 29602	afraid I am for him and for myself and about everything!...â NatÃ¡sha
 29603	began, and without replying to SÃ³nyaâs words of comfort she got into
 29604	bed, and long after her candle was out lay open-eyed and motionless,
 29605	gazing at the moonlight through the frosty windowpanes.
 29606	
 29607	
 29608

 29611	CHAPTER XIII
 29612	
 29613	Soon after the Christmas holidays Nicholas told his mother of his love
 29614	for SÃ³nya and of his firm resolve to marry her. The countess, who
 29615	had long noticed what was going on between them and was expecting this
 29616	declaration, listened to him in silence and then told her son that he
 29617	might marry whom he pleased, but that neither she nor his father would
 29618	give their blessing to such a marriage. Nicholas, for the first time,
 29619	felt that his mother was displeased with him and that, despite her love
 29620	for him, she would not give way. Coldly, without looking at her son,
 29621	she sent for her husband and, when he came, tried briefly and coldly to
 29622	inform him of the facts, in her sonâs presence, but unable to restrain
 29623	herself she burst into tears of vexation and left the room. The old
 29624	count began irresolutely to admonish Nicholas and beg him to abandon his
 29625	purpose. Nicholas replied that he could not go back on his word, and his
 29626	father, sighing and evidently disconcerted, very soon became silent and
 29627	went in to the countess. In all his encounters with his son, the count
 29628	was always conscious of his own guilt toward him for having wasted the
 29629	family fortune, and so he could not be angry with him for refusing to
 29630	marry an heiress and choosing the dowerless SÃ³nya. On this occasion, he
 29631	was only more vividly conscious of the fact that if his affairs had not
 29632	been in disorder, no better wife for Nicholas than SÃ³nya could have
 29633	been wished for, and that no one but himself with his MÃ­tenka and
 29634	his uncomfortable habits was to blame for the condition of the family
 29635	finances.
 29636	
 29637	The father and mother did not speak of the matter to their son again,
 29638	but a few days later the countess sent for SÃ³nya and, with a cruelty
 29639	neither of them expected, reproached her niece for trying to catch
 29640	Nicholas and for ingratitude. SÃ³nya listened silently with downcast
 29641	eyes to the countessâ cruel words, without understanding what
 29642	was required of her. She was ready to sacrifice everything for her
 29643	benefactors. Self-sacrifice was her most cherished idea but in this case
 29644	she could not see what she ought to sacrifice, or for whom. She could
 29645	not help loving the countess and the whole RostÃ³v family, but neither
 29646	could she help loving Nicholas and knowing that his happiness depended
 29647	on that love. She was silent and sad and did not reply. Nicholas felt
 29648	the situation to be intolerable and went to have an explanation with his
 29649	mother. He first implored her to forgive him and SÃ³nya and consent to
 29650	their marriage, then he threatened that if she molested SÃ³nya he would
 29651	at once marry her secretly.
 29652	
 29653	The countess, with a coldness her son had never seen in her before,
 29654	replied that he was of age, that Prince Andrew was marrying without his
 29655	fatherâs consent, and he could do the same, but that she would never
 29656	receive that intriguer as her daughter.
 29657	
 29658	Exploding at the word intriguer, Nicholas, raising his voice, told
 29659	his mother he had never expected her to try to force him to sell his
 29660	feelings, but if that were so, he would say for the last time.... But he
 29661	had no time to utter the decisive word which the expression of his face
 29662	caused his mother to await with terror, and which would perhaps have
 29663	forever remained a cruel memory to them both. He had not time to say it,
 29664	for NatÃ¡sha, with a pale and set face, entered the room from the door
 29665	at which she had been listening.
 29666	
 29667	âNicholas, you are talking nonsense! Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet, I
 29668	tell you!...â she almost screamed, so as to drown his voice.
 29669	
 29670	âMamma darling, itâs not at all so... my poor, sweet darling,â she
 29671	said to her mother, who conscious that they had been on the brink of
 29672	a rupture gazed at her son with terror, but in the obstinacy and
 29673	excitement of the conflict could not and would not give way.
 29674	
 29675	âNicholas, Iâll explain to you. Go away! Listen, Mamma darling,â
 29676	said NatÃ¡sha.
 29677	
 29678	Her words were incoherent, but they attained the purpose at which she
 29679	was aiming.
 29680	
 29681	The countess, sobbing heavily, hid her face on her daughterâs breast,
 29682	while Nicholas rose, clutching his head, and left the room.
 29683	
 29684	NatÃ¡sha set to work to effect a reconciliation, and so far succeeded
 29685	that Nicholas received a promise from his mother that SÃ³nya should not
 29686	be troubled, while he on his side promised not to undertake anything
 29687	without his parentsâ knowledge.
 29688	
 29689	Firmly resolved, after putting his affairs in order in the regiment,
 29690	to retire from the army and return and marry SÃ³nya, Nicholas, serious,
 29691	sorrowful, and at variance with his parents, but, as it seemed to him,
 29692	passionately in love, left at the beginning of January to rejoin his
 29693	regiment.
 29694	
 29695	After Nicholas had gone things in the RostÃ³v household were more
 29696	depressing than ever, and the countess fell ill from mental agitation.
 29697	
 29698	SÃ³nya was unhappy at the separation from Nicholas and still more so on
 29699	account of the hostile tone the countess could not help adopting toward
 29700	her. The count was more perturbed than ever by the condition of his
 29701	affairs, which called for some decisive action. Their town house and
 29702	estate near Moscow had inevitably to be sold, and for this they had to
 29703	go to Moscow. But the countessâ health obliged them to delay their
 29704	departure from day to day.
 29705	
 29706	NatÃ¡sha, who had borne the first period of separation from her
 29707	betrothed lightly and even cheerfully, now grew more agitated and
 29708	impatient every day. The thought that her best days, which she would
 29709	have employed in loving him, were being vainly wasted, with no advantage
 29710	to anyone, tormented her incessantly. His letters for the most part
 29711	irritated her. It hurt her to think that while she lived only in the
 29712	thought of him, he was living a real life, seeing new places and new
 29713	people that interested him. The more interesting his letters were
 29714	the more vexed she felt. Her letters to him, far from giving her any
 29715	comfort, seemed to her a wearisome and artificial obligation. She could
 29716	not write, because she could not conceive the possibility of expressing
 29717	sincerely in a letter even a thousandth part of what she expressed by
 29718	voice, smile, and glance. She wrote to him formal, monotonous, and dry
 29719	letters, to which she attached no importance herself, and in the rough
 29720	copies of which the countess corrected her mistakes in spelling.
 29721	
 29722	There was still no improvement in the countessâ health, but it was
 29723	impossible to defer the journey to Moscow any longer. NatÃ¡shaâs
 29724	trousseau had to be ordered and the house sold. Moreover, Prince Andrew
 29725	was expected in Moscow, where old Prince BolkÃ³nski was spending the
 29726	winter, and NatÃ¡sha felt sure he had already arrived.
 29727	
 29728	So the countess remained in the country, and the count, taking SÃ³nya
 29729	and NatÃ¡sha with him, went to Moscow at the end of January.

 29741	CHAPTER I
 29742	
 29743	After Prince Andrewâs engagement to NatÃ¡sha, Pierre without any
 29744	apparent cause suddenly felt it impossible to go on living as before.
 29745	Firmly convinced as he was of the truths revealed to him by his
 29746	benefactor, and happy as he had been in perfecting his inner man, to
 29747	which he had devoted himself with such ardorâall the zest of such a
 29748	life vanished after the engagement of Andrew and NatÃ¡sha and the death
 29749	of Joseph AlexÃ©evich, the news of which reached him almost at the same
 29750	time. Only the skeleton of life remained: his house, a brilliant wife
 29751	who now enjoyed the favors of a very important personage, acquaintance
 29752	with all Petersburg, and his court service with its dull formalities.
 29753	And this life suddenly seemed to Pierre unexpectedly loathsome. He
 29754	ceased keeping a diary, avoided the company of the Brothers, began going
 29755	to the club again, drank a great deal, and came once more in touch
 29756	with the bachelor sets, leading such a life that the Countess HÃ©lÃ¨ne
 29757	thought it necessary to speak severely to him about it. Pierre felt that
 29758	she was right, and to avoid compromising her went away to Moscow.
 29759	
 29760	In Moscow as soon as he entered his huge house in which the faded and
 29761	fading princesses still lived, with its enormous retinue; as soon as,
 29762	driving through the town, he saw the Iberian shrine with innumerable
 29763	tapers burning before the golden covers of the icons, the KrÃ©mlin
 29764	Square with its snow undisturbed by vehicles, the sleigh drivers and
 29765	hovels of the SÃ­vtsev VrazhÃ³k, those old Moscovites who desired
 29766	nothing, hurried nowhere, and were ending their days leisurely; when he
 29767	saw those old Moscow ladies, the Moscow balls, and the English Club, he
 29768	felt himself at home in a quiet haven. In Moscow he felt at peace, at
 29769	home, warm and dirty as in an old dressing gown.
 29770	
 29771	Moscow society, from the old women down to the children, received Pierre
 29772	like a long-expected guest whose place was always ready awaiting him.
 29773	For Moscow society Pierre was the nicest, kindest, most intellectual,
 29774	merriest, and most magnanimous of cranks, a heedless, genial nobleman of
 29775	the old Russian type. His purse was always empty because it was open to
 29776	everyone.
 29777	
 29778	Benefit performances, poor pictures, statues, benevolent societies,
 29779	gypsy choirs, schools, subscription dinners, sprees, Freemasons,
 29780	churches, and booksâno one and nothing met with a refusal from him,
 29781	and had it not been for two friends who had borrowed large sums from
 29782	him and taken him under their protection, he would have given everything
 29783	away. There was never a dinner or soiree at the club without him. As
 29784	soon as he sank into his place on the sofa after two bottles of Margaux
 29785	he was surrounded, and talking, disputing, and joking began. When there
 29786	were quarrels, his kindly smile and well-timed jests reconciled the
 29787	antagonists. The Masonic dinners were dull and dreary when he was not
 29788	there.
 29789	
 29790	When after a bachelor supper he rose with his amiable and kindly smile,
 29791	yielding to the entreaties of the festive company to drive off somewhere
 29792	with them, shouts of delight and triumph arose among the young men.
 29793	At balls he danced if a partner was needed. Young ladies, married and
 29794	unmarried, liked him because without making love to any of them, he was
 29795	equally amiable to all, especially after supper. âIl est charmant; il
 29796	nâa pas de sexe,â * they said of him.
 29797	
 29798	    * âHe is charming; he has no sex.â
 29799	
 29800	
 29801	Pierre was one of those retired gentlemen-in-waiting of whom there were
 29802	hundreds good-humoredly ending their days in Moscow.
 29803	
 29804	How horrified he would have been seven years before, when he first
 29805	arrived from abroad, had he been told that there was no need for him
 29806	to seek or plan anything, that his rut had long been shaped, eternally
 29807	predetermined, and that wriggle as he might, he would be what all in
 29808	his position were. He could not have believed it! Had he not at one
 29809	time longed with all his heart to establish a republic in Russia;
 29810	then himself to be a Napoleon; then to be a philosopher; and then
 29811	a strategist and the conqueror of Napoleon? Had he not seen the
 29812	possibility of, and passionately desired, the regeneration of the sinful
 29813	human race, and his own progress to the highest degree of perfection?
 29814	Had he not established schools and hospitals and liberated his serfs?
 29815	
 29816	But instead of all thatâhere he was, the wealthy husband of an
 29817	unfaithful wife, a retired gentleman-in-waiting, fond of eating and
 29818	drinking and, as he unbuttoned his waistcoat, of abusing the government
 29819	a bit, a member of the Moscow English Club, and a universal favorite in
 29820	Moscow society. For a long time he could not reconcile himself to the
 29821	idea that he was one of those same retired Moscow gentlemen-in-waiting
 29822	he had so despised seven years before.
 29823	
 29824	Sometimes he consoled himself with the thought that he was only living
 29825	this life temporarily; but then he was shocked by the thought of how
 29826	many, like himself, had entered that life and that club temporarily,
 29827	with all their teeth and hair, and had only left it when not a single
 29828	tooth or hair remained.
 29829	
 29830	In moments of pride, when he thought of his position it seemed to
 29831	him that he was quite different and distinct from those other retired
 29832	gentlemen-in-waiting he had formerly despised: they were empty, stupid,
 29833	contented fellows, satisfied with their position, âwhile I am still
 29834	discontented and want to do something for mankind. But perhaps all these
 29835	comrades of mine struggled just like me and sought something new, a
 29836	path in life of their own, and like me were brought by force of
 29837	circumstances, society, and raceâby that elemental force against which
 29838	man is powerlessâto the condition I am in,â said he to himself in
 29839	moments of humility; and after living some time in Moscow he no longer
 29840	despised, but began to grow fond of, to respect, and to pity his
 29841	comrades in destiny, as he pitied himself.
 29842	
 29843	Pierre no longer suffered moments of despair, hypochondria, and disgust
 29844	with life, but the malady that had formerly found expression in such
 29845	acute attacks was driven inwards and never left him for a moment.
 29846	âWhat for? Why? What is going on in the world?â he would ask himself
 29847	in perplexity several times a day, involuntarily beginning to reflect
 29848	anew on the meaning of the phenomena of life; but knowing by experience
 29849	that there were no answers to these questions he made haste to turn away
 29850	from them, and took up a book, or hurried off to the club or to ApollÃ³n
 29851	NikolÃ¡evichâs, to exchange the gossip of the town.
 29852	
 29853	âHÃ©lÃ¨ne, who has never cared for anything but her own body and
 29854	is one of the stupidest women in the world,â thought Pierre, âis
 29855	regarded by people as the acme of intelligence and refinement, and they
 29856	pay homage to her. Napoleon Bonaparte was despised by all as long as he
 29857	was great, but now that he has become a wretched comedian the Emperor
 29858	Francis wants to offer him his daughter in an illegal marriage. The
 29859	Spaniards, through the Catholic clergy, offer praise to God for their
 29860	victory over the French on the fourteenth of June, and the French,
 29861	also through the Catholic clergy, offer praise because on that same
 29862	fourteenth of June they defeated the Spaniards. My brother Masons swear
 29863	by the blood that they are ready to sacrifice everything for their
 29864	neighbor, but they do not give a ruble each to the collections for the
 29865	poor, and they intrigue, the Astraea Lodge against the Manna Seekers,
 29866	and fuss about an authentic Scotch carpet and a charter that nobody
 29867	needs, and the meaning of which the very man who wrote it does not
 29868	understand. We all profess the Christian law of forgiveness of injuries
 29869	and love of our neighbors, the law in honor of which we have built in
 29870	Moscow forty times forty churchesâbut yesterday a deserter was knouted
 29871	to death and a minister of that same law of love and forgiveness, a
 29872	priest, gave the soldier a cross to kiss before his execution.â So
 29873	thought Pierre, and the whole of this general deception which everyone
 29874	accepts, accustomed as he was to it, astonished him each time as if it
 29875	were something new. âI understand the deception and confusion,â he
 29876	thought, âbut how am I to tell them all that I see? I have tried, and
 29877	have always found that they too in the depths of their souls understand
 29878	it as I do, and only try not to see it. So it appears that it must
 29879	be so! But Iâwhat is to become of me?â thought he. He had the
 29880	unfortunate capacity many men, especially Russians, have of seeing and
 29881	believing in the possibility of goodness and truth, but of seeing the
 29882	evil and falsehood of life too clearly to be able to take a serious part
 29883	in it. Every sphere of work was connected, in his eyes, with evil and
 29884	deception. Whatever he tried to be, whatever he engaged in, the evil and
 29885	falsehood of it repulsed him and blocked every path of activity. Yet he
 29886	had to live and to find occupation. It was too dreadful to be under
 29887	the burden of these insoluble problems, so he abandoned himself to
 29888	any distraction in order to forget them. He frequented every kind of
 29889	society, drank much, bought pictures, engaged in building, and above
 29890	allâread.
 29891	
 29892	He read, and read everything that came to hand. On coming home, while
 29893	his valets were still taking off his things, he picked up a book and
 29894	began to read. From reading he passed to sleeping, from sleeping to
 29895	gossip in drawing rooms of the club, from gossip to carousals and women;
 29896	from carousals back to gossip, reading, and wine. Drinking became more
 29897	and more a physical and also a moral necessity. Though the doctors
 29898	warned him that with his corpulence wine was dangerous for him, he
 29899	drank a great deal. He was only quite at ease when having poured several
 29900	glasses of wine mechanically into his large mouth he felt a pleasant
 29901	warmth in his body, an amiability toward all his fellows, and a
 29902	readiness to respond superficially to every idea without probing it
 29903	deeply. Only after emptying a bottle or two did he feel dimly that the
 29904	terribly tangled skein of life which previously had terrified him was
 29905	not as dreadful as he had thought. He was always conscious of some
 29906	aspect of that skein, as with a buzzing in his head after dinner or
 29907	supper he chatted or listened to conversation or read. But under the
 29908	influence of wine he said to himself: âIt doesnât matter. Iâll
 29909	get it unraveled. I have a solution ready, but have no time nowâIâll
 29910	think it all out later on!â But the later on never came.
 29911	
 29912	In the morning, on an empty stomach, all the old questions appeared as
 29913	insoluble and terrible as ever, and Pierre hastily picked up a book, and
 29914	if anyone came to see him he was glad.
 29915	
 29916	Sometimes he remembered how he had heard that soldiers in war when
 29917	entrenched under the enemyâs fire, if they have nothing to do, try
 29918	hard to find some occupation the more easily to bear the danger. To
 29919	Pierre all men seemed like those soldiers, seeking refuge from life:
 29920	some in ambition, some in cards, some in framing laws, some in women,
 29921	some in toys, some in horses, some in politics, some in sport, some
 29922	in wine, and some in governmental affairs. âNothing is trivial, and
 29923	nothing is important, itâs all the sameâonly to save oneself from it
 29924	as best one can,â thought Pierre. âOnly not to see it, that dreadful
 29925	it!â
 29926	
 29927	
 29928	
 29929	
 29930	
 29931	CHAPTER II
 29932	
 29933	At the beginning of winter Prince Nicholas BolkÃ³nski and his daughter
 29934	moved to Moscow. At that time enthusiasm for the Emperor Alexanderâs
 29935	regime had weakened and a patriotic and anti-French tendency prevailed
 29936	there, and this, together with his past and his intellect and his
 29937	originality, at once made Prince Nicholas BolkÃ³nski an object of
 29938	particular respect to the Moscovites and the center of the Moscow
 29939	opposition to the government.
 29940	
 29941	The prince had aged very much that year. He showed marked signs of
 29942	senility by a tendency to fall asleep, forgetfulness of quite recent
 29943	events, remembrance of remote ones, and the childish vanity with which
 29944	he accepted the role of head of the Moscow opposition. In spite of this
 29945	the old man inspired in all his visitors alike a feeling of respectful
 29946	venerationâespecially of an evening when he came in to tea in his
 29947	old-fashioned coat and powdered wig and, aroused by anyone, told his
 29948	abrupt stories of the past, or uttered yet more abrupt and scathing
 29949	criticisms of the present. For them all, that old-fashioned house with
 29950	its gigantic mirrors, pre-Revolution furniture, powdered footmen, and
 29951	the stern shrewd old man (himself a relic of the past century) with his
 29952	gentle daughter and the pretty Frenchwoman who were reverently devoted
 29953	to him presented a majestic and agreeable spectacle. But the visitors
 29954	did not reflect that besides the couple of hours during which they saw
 29955	their host, there were also twenty-two hours in the day during which the
 29956	private and intimate life of the house continued.
 29957	
 29958	Latterly that private life had become very trying for Princess Mary.
 29959	There in Moscow she was deprived of her greatest pleasuresâtalks with
 29960	the pilgrims and the solitude which refreshed her at Bald Hillsâand
 29961	she had none of the advantages and pleasures of city life. She did not
 29962	go out into society; everyone knew that her father would not let her
 29963	go anywhere without him, and his failing health prevented his going out
 29964	himself, so that she was not invited to dinners and evening parties. She
 29965	had quite abandoned the hope of getting married. She saw the coldness
 29966	and malevolence with which the old prince received and dismissed the
 29967	young men, possible suitors, who sometimes appeared at their house. She
 29968	had no friends: during this visit to Moscow she had been disappointed in
 29969	the two who had been nearest to her. Mademoiselle Bourienne, with whom
 29970	she had never been able to be quite frank, had now become unpleasant to
 29971	her, and for various reasons Princess Mary avoided her. Julie, with whom
 29972	she had corresponded for the last five years, was in Moscow, but proved
 29973	to be quite alien to her when they met. Just then Julie, who by the
 29974	death of her brothers had become one of the richest heiresses in Moscow,
 29975	was in the full whirl of society pleasures. She was surrounded by young
 29976	men who, she fancied, had suddenly learned to appreciate her worth.
 29977	Julie was at that stage in the life of a society woman when she feels
 29978	that her last chance of marrying has come and that her fate must be
 29979	decided now or never. On Thursdays Princess Mary remembered with a
 29980	mournful smile that she now had no one to write to, since Julieâwhose
 29981	presence gave her no pleasure was here and they met every week. Like the
 29982	old Ã©migrÃ© who declined to marry the lady with whom he had spent his
 29983	evenings for years, she regretted Julieâs presence and having no one
 29984	to write to. In Moscow Princess Mary had no one to talk to, no one to
 29985	whom to confide her sorrow, and much sorrow fell to her lot just then.
 29986	The time for Prince Andrewâs return and marriage was approaching, but
 29987	his request to her to prepare his father for it had not been carried
 29988	out; in fact, it seemed as if matters were quite hopeless, for at every
 29989	mention of the young Countess RostÃ³va the old prince (who apart from
 29990	that was usually in a bad temper) lost control of himself. Another
 29991	lately added sorrow arose from the lessons she gave her six year-old
 29992	nephew. To her consternation she detected in herself in relation to
 29993	little Nicholas some symptoms of her fatherâs irritability. However
 29994	often she told herself that she must not get irritable when teaching her
 29995	nephew, almost every time that, pointer in hand, she sat down to show
 29996	him the French alphabet, she so longed to pour her own knowledge quickly
 29997	and easily into the childâwho was already afraid that Auntie might at
 29998	any moment get angryâthat at his slightest inattention she trembled,
 29999	became flustered and heated, raised her voice, and sometimes pulled him
 30000	by the arm and put him in the corner. Having put him in the corner
 30001	she would herself begin to cry over her cruel, evil nature, and little
 30002	Nicholas, following her example, would sob, and without permission would
 30003	leave his corner, come to her, pull her wet hands from her face, and
 30004	comfort her. But what distressed the princess most of all was her
 30005	fatherâs irritability, which was always directed against her and had
 30006	of late amounted to cruelty. Had he forced her to prostrate herself to
 30007	the ground all night, had he beaten her or made her fetch wood or water,
 30008	it would never have entered her mind to think her position hard; but
 30009	this loving despotâthe more cruel because he loved her and for that
 30010	reason tormented himself and herâknew how not merely to hurt and
 30011	humiliate her deliberately, but to show her that she was always to blame
 30012	for everything. Of late he had exhibited a new trait that tormented
 30013	Princess Mary more than anything else; this was his ever-increasing
 30014	intimacy with Mademoiselle Bourienne. The idea that at the first moment
 30015	of receiving the news of his sonâs intentions had occurred to him in
 30016	jestâthat if Andrew got married he himself would marry Bourienneâhad
 30017	evidently pleased him, and latterly he had persistently, and as it
 30018	seemed to Princess Mary merely to offend her, shown special endearments
 30019	to the companion and expressed his dissatisfaction with his daughter by
 30020	demonstrations of love of Bourienne.
 30021	
 30022	One day in Moscow in Princess Maryâs presence (she thought her father
 30023	did it purposely when she was there) the old prince kissed Mademoiselle
 30024	Bourienneâs hand and, drawing her to him, embraced her affectionately.
 30025	Princess Mary flushed and ran out of the room. A few minutes later
 30026	Mademoiselle Bourienne came into Princess Maryâs room smiling and
 30027	making cheerful remarks in her agreeable voice. Princess Mary hastily
 30028	wiped away her tears, went resolutely up to Mademoiselle Bourienne,
 30029	and evidently unconscious of what she was doing began shouting in angry
 30030	haste at the Frenchwoman, her voice breaking: âItâs horrible, vile,
 30031	inhuman, to take advantage of the weakness...â She did not finish.
 30032	âLeave my room,â she exclaimed, and burst into sobs.
 30033	
 30034	Next day the prince did not say a word to his daughter, but she noticed
 30035	that at dinner he gave orders that Mademoiselle Bourienne should be
 30036	served first. After dinner, when the footman handed coffee and from
 30037	habit began with the princess, the prince suddenly grew furious,
 30038	threw his stick at Philip, and instantly gave instructions to have him
 30039	conscripted for the army.
 30040	
 30041	âHe doesnât obey... I said it twice... and he doesnât obey! She
 30042	is the first person in this house; sheâs my best friend,â cried
 30043	the prince. âAnd if you allow yourself,â he screamed in a fury,
 30044	addressing Princess Mary for the first time, âto forget yourself again
 30045	before her as you dared to do yesterday, I will show you who is master
 30046	in this house. Go! Donât let me set eyes on you; beg her pardon!â
 30047	
 30048	Princess Mary asked Mademoiselle Bourienneâs pardon, and also her
 30049	fatherâs pardon for herself and for Philip the footman, who had begged
 30050	for her intervention.
 30051	
 30052	At such moments something like a pride of sacrifice gathered in her
 30053	soul. And suddenly that father whom she had judged would look for his
 30054	spectacles in her presence, fumbling near them and not seeing them, or
 30055	would forget something that had just occurred, or take a false step with
 30056	his failing legs and turn to see if anyone had noticed his feebleness,
 30057	or, worst of all, at dinner when there were no visitors to excite him
 30058	would suddenly fall asleep, letting his napkin drop and his shaking
 30059	head sink over his plate. âHe is old and feeble, and I dare to condemn
 30060	him!â she thought at such moments, with a feeling of revulsion against
 30061	herself.

 30067	CHAPTER III
 30068	
 30069	In 1811 there was living in Moscow a French doctorâMÃ©tivierâwho had
 30070	rapidly become the fashion. He was enormously tall, handsome, amiable
 30071	as Frenchmen are, and was, as all Moscow said, an extraordinarily clever
 30072	doctor. He was received in the best houses not merely as a doctor, but
 30073	as an equal.
 30074	
 30075	Prince Nicholas had always ridiculed medicine, but latterly on
 30076	Mademoiselle Bourienneâs advice had allowed this doctor to visit him
 30077	and had grown accustomed to him. MÃ©tivier came to see the prince about
 30078	twice a week.
 30079	
 30080	On December 6âSt. Nicholasâ Day and the princeâs name dayâall
 30081	Moscow came to the princeâs front door but he gave orders to admit no
 30082	one and to invite to dinner only a small number, a list of whom he gave
 30083	to Princess Mary.
 30084	
 30085	MÃ©tivier, who came in the morning with his felicitations, considered
 30086	it proper in his quality of doctor de forcer la consigne, * as he told
 30087	Princess Mary, and went in to see the prince. It happened that on that
 30088	morning of his name day the prince was in one of his worst moods. He had
 30089	been going about the house all the morning finding fault with everyone
 30090	and pretending not to understand what was said to him and not to be
 30091	understood himself. Princess Mary well knew this mood of quiet absorbed
 30092	querulousness, which generally culminated in a burst of rage, and she
 30093	went about all that morning as though facing a cocked and loaded gun
 30094	and awaited the inevitable explosion. Until the doctorâs arrival the
 30095	morning had passed off safely. After admitting the doctor, Princess Mary
 30096	sat down with a book in the drawing room near the door through which she
 30097	could hear all that passed in the study.
 30098	
 30099	    * To force the guard.
 30100	
 30101	At first she heard only MÃ©tivierâs voice, then her fatherâs, then
 30102	both voices began speaking at the same time, the door was flung open,
 30103	and on the threshold appeared the handsome figure of the terrified
 30104	MÃ©tivier with his shock of black hair, and the prince in his dressing
 30105	gown and fez, his face distorted with fury and the pupils of his eyes
 30106	rolled downwards.
 30107	
 30108	âYou donât understand?â shouted the prince, âbut I do! French
 30109	spy, slave of Buonaparte, spy, get out of my house! Be off, I tell
 30110	you...â and he slammed the door.
 30111	
 30112	MÃ©tivier, shrugging his shoulders, went up to Mademoiselle Bourienne
 30113	who at the sound of shouting had run in from an adjoining room.
 30114	
 30115	âThe prince is not very well: bile and rush of blood to the head. Keep
 30116	calm, I will call again tomorrow,â said MÃ©tivier; and putting his
 30117	fingers to his lips he hastened away.
 30118	
 30119	Through the study door came the sound of slippered feet and the cry:
 30120	âSpies, traitors, traitors everywhere! Not a momentâs peace in my
 30121	own house!â
 30122	
 30123	After MÃ©tivierâs departure the old prince called his daughter in, and
 30124	the whole weight of his wrath fell on her. She was to blame that a spy
 30125	had been admitted. Had he not told her, yes, told her to make a list,
 30126	and not to admit anyone who was not on that list? Then why was that
 30127	scoundrel admitted? She was the cause of it all. With her, he said, he
 30128	could not have a momentâs peace and could not die quietly.
 30129	
 30130	âNo, maâam! We must part, we must part! Understand that, understand
 30131	it! I cannot endure any more,â he said, and left the room. Then, as if
 30132	afraid she might find some means of consolation, he returned and trying
 30133	to appear calm added: âAnd donât imagine I have said this in a
 30134	moment of anger. I am calm. I have thought it over, and it will be
 30135	carried outâwe must part; so find some place for yourself....â But
 30136	he could not restrain himself and with the virulence of which only one
 30137	who loves is capable, evidently suffering himself, he shook his fists at
 30138	her and screamed:
 30139	
 30140	âIf only some fool would marry her!â Then he slammed the door, sent
 30141	for Mademoiselle Bourienne, and subsided into his study.
 30142	
 30143	At two oâclock the six chosen guests assembled for dinner.
 30144	
 30145	These guestsâthe famous Count RostopchÃ­n, Prince LopukhÃ­n with his
 30146	nephew, General ChatrÃ³v an old war comrade of the princeâs, and
 30147	of the younger generation Pierre and BorÃ­s DrubetskÃ³yâawaited the
 30148	prince in the drawing room.
 30149	
 30150	BorÃ­s, who had come to Moscow on leave a few days before, had been
 30151	anxious to be presented to Prince Nicholas BolkÃ³nski, and had contrived
 30152	to ingratiate himself so well that the old prince in his case made an
 30153	exception to the rule of not receiving bachelors in his house.
 30154	
 30155	The princeâs house did not belong to what is known as fashionable
 30156	society, but his little circleâthough not much talked about in
 30157	townâwas one it was more flattering to be received in than any other.
 30158	BorÃ­s had realized this the week before when the commander in chief in
 30159	his presence invited RostopchÃ­n to dinner on St. Nicholasâ Day, and
 30160	RostopchÃ­n had replied that he could not come:
 30161	
 30162	âOn that day I always go to pay my devotions to the relics of Prince
 30163	Nicholas BolkÃ³nski.â
 30164	
 30165	âOh, yes, yes!â replied the commander in chief. âHow is he?...â
 30166	
 30167	The small group that assembled before dinner in the lofty old-fashioned
 30168	drawing room with its old furniture resembled the solemn gathering of
 30169	a court of justice. All were silent or talked in low tones. Prince
 30170	Nicholas came in serious and taciturn. Princess Mary seemed even quieter
 30171	and more diffident than usual. The guests were reluctant to address
 30172	her, feeling that she was in no mood for their conversation. Count
 30173	RostopchÃ­n alone kept the conversation going, now relating the latest
 30174	town news, and now the latest political gossip.
 30175	
 30176	LopukhÃ­n and the old general occasionally took part in the
 30177	conversation. Prince BolkÃ³nski listened as a presiding judge receives a
 30178	report, only now and then, silently or by a brief word, showing that
 30179	he took heed of what was being reported to him. The tone of the
 30180	conversation was such as indicated that no one approved of what was
 30181	being done in the political world. Incidents were related evidently
 30182	confirming the opinion that everything was going from bad to worse, but
 30183	whether telling a story or giving an opinion the speaker always stopped,
 30184	or was stopped, at the point beyond which his criticism might touch the
 30185	sovereign himself.
 30186	
 30187	At dinner the talk turned on the latest political news: Napoleonâs
 30188	seizure of the Duke of Oldenburgâs territory, and the Russian Note,
 30189	hostile to Napoleon, which had been sent to all the European courts.
 30190	
 30191	âBonaparte treats Europe as a pirate does a captured vessel,â said
 30192	Count RostopchÃ­n, repeating a phrase he had uttered several times
 30193	before. âOne only wonders at the long-suffering or blindness of the
 30194	crowned heads. Now the Popeâs turn has come and Bonaparte doesnât
 30195	scruple to depose the head of the Catholic Churchâyet all keep silent!
 30196	Our sovereign alone has protested against the seizure of the Duke
 30197	of Oldenburgâs territory, and even...â Count RostopchÃ­n paused,
 30198	feeling that he had reached the limit beyond which censure was
 30199	impossible.
 30200	
 30201	âOther territories have been offered in exchange for the Duchy of
 30202	Oldenburg,â said Prince BolkÃ³nski. âHe shifts the Dukes about as
 30203	I might move my serfs from Bald Hills to BoguchÃ¡rovo or my RyazÃ¡n
 30204	estates.â
 30205	
 30206	âThe Duke of Oldenburg bears his misfortunes with admirable
 30207	strength of character and resignation,â remarked BorÃ­s, joining in
 30208	respectfully.
 30209	
 30210	He said this because on his journey from Petersburg he had had the honor
 30211	of being presented to the Duke. Prince BolkÃ³nski glanced at the
 30212	young man as if about to say something in reply, but changed his mind,
 30213	evidently considering him too young.
 30214	
 30215	âI have read our protests about the Oldenburg affair and was surprised
 30216	how badly the Note was worded,â remarked Count RostopchÃ­n in the
 30217	casual tone of a man dealing with a subject quite familiar to him.
 30218	
 30219	Pierre looked at RostopchÃ­n with naÃ¯ve astonishment, not understanding
 30220	why he should be disturbed by the bad composition of the Note.
 30221	
 30222	âDoes it matter, Count, how the Note is worded,â he asked, âso
 30223	long as its substance is forcible?â
 30224	
 30225	âMy dear fellow, with our five hundred thousand troops it should be
 30226	easy to have a good style,â returned Count RostopchÃ­n.
 30227	
 30228	Pierre now understood the countâs dissatisfaction with the wording of
 30229	the Note.
 30230	
 30231	âOne would have thought quill drivers enough had sprung up,â
 30232	remarked the old prince. âThere in Petersburg they are always
 30233	writingânot notes only but even new laws. My Andrew there has written
 30234	a whole volume of laws for Russia. Nowadays they are always writing!â
 30235	and he laughed unnaturally.
 30236	
 30237	There was a momentary pause in the conversation; the old general cleared
 30238	his throat to draw attention.
 30239	
 30240	âDid you hear of the last event at the review in Petersburg? The
 30241	figure cut by the new French ambassador.â
 30242	
 30243	âEh? Yes, I heard something: he said something awkward in His
 30244	Majestyâs presence.â
 30245	
 30246	âHis Majesty drew attention to the Grenadier division and to the march
 30247	past,â continued the general, âand it seems the ambassador took
 30248	no notice and allowed himself to reply that: âWe in France pay no
 30249	attention to such trifles!â The Emperor did not condescend to reply.
 30250	At the next review, they say, the Emperor did not once deign to address
 30251	him.â
 30252	
 30253	All were silent. On this fact relating to the Emperor personally, it was
 30254	impossible to pass any judgment.
 30255	
 30256	âImpudent fellows!â said the prince. âYou know MÃ©tivier? I turned
 30257	him out of my house this morning. He was here; they admitted him in
 30258	spite of my request that they should let no one in,â he went on,
 30259	glancing angrily at his daughter.
 30260	
 30261	And he narrated his whole conversation with the French doctor and
 30262	the reasons that convinced him that MÃ©tivier was a spy. Though these
 30263	reasons were very insufficient and obscure, no one made any rejoinder.
 30264	
 30265	After the roast, champagne was served. The guests rose to congratulate
 30266	the old prince. Princess Mary, too, went round to him.
 30267	
 30268	He gave her a cold, angry look and offered her his wrinkled,
 30269	clean-shaven cheek to kiss. The whole expression of his face told
 30270	her that he had not forgotten the morningâs talk, that his decision
 30271	remained in force, and only the presence of visitors hindered his
 30272	speaking of it to her now.
 30273	
 30274	When they went into the drawing room where coffee was served, the old
 30275	men sat together.
 30276	
 30277	Prince Nicholas grew more animated and expressed his views on the
 30278	impending war.
 30279	
 30280	He said that our wars with Bonaparte would be disastrous so long as we
 30281	sought alliances with the Germans and thrust ourselves into European
 30282	affairs, into which we had been drawn by the Peace of Tilsit. âWe
 30283	ought not to fight either for or against Austria. Our political
 30284	interests are all in the East, and in regard to Bonaparte the only thing
 30285	is to have an armed frontier and a firm policy, and he will never dare
 30286	to cross the Russian frontier, as was the case in 1807!â
 30287	
 30288	âHow can we fight the French, Prince?â said Count RostopchÃ­n.
 30289	âCan we arm ourselves against our teachers and divinities? Look at
 30290	our youths, look at our ladies! The French are our Gods: Paris is our
 30291	Kingdom of Heaven.â
 30292	
 30293	He began speaking louder, evidently to be heard by everyone.
 30294	
 30295	âFrench dresses, French ideas, French feelings! There now, you turned
 30296	MÃ©tivier out by the scruff of his neck because he is a Frenchman and
 30297	a scoundrel, but our ladies crawl after him on their knees. I went to
 30298	a party last night, and there out of five ladies three were Roman
 30299	Catholics and had the Popeâs indulgence for doing woolwork on Sundays.
 30300	And they themselves sit there nearly naked, like the signboards at our
 30301	Public Baths if I may say so. Ah, when one looks at our young people,
 30302	Prince, one would like to take Peter the Greatâs old cudgel out of the
 30303	museum and belabor them in the Russian way till all the nonsense jumps
 30304	out of them.â
 30305	
 30306	All were silent. The old prince looked at RostopchÃ­n with a smile and
 30307	wagged his head approvingly.
 30308	
 30309	âWell, good-by, your excellency, keep well!â said RostopchÃ­n,
 30310	getting up with characteristic briskness and holding out his hand to the
 30311	prince.
 30312	
 30313	âGood-by, my dear fellow.... His words are music, I never tire of
 30314	hearing him!â said the old prince, keeping hold of the hand and
 30315	offering his cheek to be kissed.
 30316	
 30317	Following RostopchÃ­nâs example the others also rose.
 30318	
 30319	
 30320	
 30321	
 30322	
 30323	CHAPTER IV
 30324	
 30325	Princess Mary as she sat listening to the old menâs talk and
 30326	faultfinding, understood nothing of what she heard; she only wondered
 30327	whether the guests had all observed her fatherâs hostile attitude
 30328	toward her. She did not even notice the special attentions and
 30329	amiabilities shown her during dinner by BorÃ­s DrubetskÃ³y, who was
 30330	visiting them for the third time already.
 30331	
 30332	Princess Mary turned with absent-minded questioning look to Pierre, who
 30333	hat in hand and with a smile on his face was the last of the guests to
 30334	approach her after the old prince had gone out and they were left alone
 30335	in the drawing room.
 30336	
 30337	âMay I stay a little longer?â he said, letting his stout body sink
 30338	into an armchair beside her.
 30339	
 30340	âOh yes,â she answered. âYou noticed nothing?â her look asked.
 30341	
 30342	Pierre was in an agreeable after-dinner mood. He looked straight before
 30343	him and smiled quietly.
 30344	
 30345	âHave you known that young man long, Princess?â he asked.
 30346	
 30347	âWho?â
 30348	
 30349	âDrubetskÃ³y.â
 30350	
 30351	âNo, not long....â
 30352	
 30353	âDo you like him?â
 30354	
 30355	âYes, he is an agreeable young man.... Why do you ask me that?â said
 30356	Princess Mary, still thinking of that morningâs conversation with her
 30357	father.
 30358	
 30359	âBecause I have noticed that when a young man comes on leave from
 30360	Petersburg to Moscow it is usually with the object of marrying an
 30361	heiress.â
 30362	
 30363	âYou have observed that?â said Princess Mary.
 30364	
 30365	âYes,â returned Pierre with a smile, âand this young man now
 30366	manages matters so that where there is a wealthy heiress there he is
 30367	too. I can read him like a book. At present he is hesitating whom to lay
 30368	siege toâyou or Mademoiselle Julie KarÃ¡gina. He is very attentive to
 30369	her.â
 30370	
 30371	âHe visits them?â
 30372	
 30373	âYes, very often. And do you know the new way of courting?â said
 30374	Pierre with an amused smile, evidently in that cheerful mood of good
 30375	humored raillery for which he so often reproached himself in his diary.
 30376	
 30377	âNo,â replied Princess Mary.
 30378	
 30379	âTo please Moscow girls nowadays one has to be melancholy. He is very
 30380	melancholy with Mademoiselle KarÃ¡gina,â said Pierre.
 30381	
 30382	âReally?â asked Princess Mary, looking into Pierreâs kindly
 30383	face and still thinking of her own sorrow. âIt would be a relief,â
 30384	thought she, âif I ventured to confide what I am feeling to someone.
 30385	I should like to tell everything to Pierre. He is kind and generous. It
 30386	would be a relief. He would give me advice.â
 30387	
 30388	âWould you marry him?â
 30389	
 30390	âOh, my God, Count, there are moments when I would marry anybody!â
 30391	she cried suddenly to her own surprise and with tears in her voice.
 30392	âAh, how bitter it is to love someone near to you and to feel
 30393	that...â she went on in a trembling voice, âthat you can do nothing
 30394	for him but grieve him, and to know that you cannot alter this. Then
 30395	there is only one thing leftâto go away, but where could I go?â
 30396	
 30397	âWhat is wrong? What is it, Princess?â
 30398	
 30399	But without finishing what she was saying, Princess Mary burst into
 30400	tears.
 30401	
 30402	âI donât know what is the matter with me today. Donât take any
 30403	noticeâforget what I have said!â
 30404	
 30405	Pierreâs gaiety vanished completely. He anxiously questioned the
 30406	princess, asked her to speak out fully and confide her grief to him; but
 30407	she only repeated that she begged him to forget what she had said, that
 30408	she did not remember what she had said, and that she had no trouble
 30409	except the one he knew ofâthat Prince Andrewâs marriage threatened
 30410	to cause a rupture between father and son.
 30411	
 30412	âHave you any news of the RostÃ³vs?â she asked, to change the
 30413	subject. âI was told they are coming soon. I am also expecting Andrew
 30414	any day. I should like them to meet here.â
 30415	
 30416	âAnd how does he now regard the matter?â asked Pierre, referring to
 30417	the old prince.
 30418	
 30419	Princess Mary shook her head.
 30420	
 30421	âWhat is to be done? In a few months the year will be up. The thing
 30422	is impossible. I only wish I could spare my brother the first moments.
 30423	I wish they would come sooner. I hope to be friends with her. You have
 30424	known them a long time,â said Princess Mary. âTell me honestly
 30425	the whole truth: what sort of girl is she, and what do you think of
 30426	her?âThe real truth, because you know Andrew is risking so much doing
 30427	this against his fatherâs will that I should like to know....â
 30428	
 30429	An undefined instinct told Pierre that these explanations, and
 30430	repeated requests to be told the whole truth, expressed ill-will on
 30431	the princessâ part toward her future sister-in-law and a wish that
 30432	he should disapprove of Andrewâs choice; but in reply he said what he
 30433	felt rather than what he thought.
 30434	
 30435	âI donât know how to answer your question,â he said, blushing
 30436	without knowing why. âI really donât know what sort of girl she is;
 30437	I canât analyze her at all. She is enchanting, but what makes her so I
 30438	donât know. That is all one can say about her.â
 30439	
 30440	Princess Mary sighed, and the expression on her face said: âYes,
 30441	thatâs what I expected and feared.â
 30442	
 30443	âIs she clever?â she asked.
 30444	
 30445	Pierre considered.
 30446	
 30447	âI think not,â he said, âand yetâyes. She does not deign to be
 30448	clever.... Oh no, she is simply enchanting, and that is all.â
 30449	
 30450	Princess Mary again shook her head disapprovingly.
 30451	
 30452	âAh, I so long to like her! Tell her so if you see her before I do.â
 30453	
 30454	âI hear they are expected very soon,â said Pierre.
 30455	
 30456	Princess Mary told Pierre of her plan to become intimate with her future
 30457	sister-in-law as soon as the RostÃ³vs arrived and to try to accustom the
 30458	old prince to her.
 30459	
 30460	
 30461	
 30462	
 30463	
 30464	CHAPTER V
 30465	
 30466	BorÃ­s had not succeeded in making a wealthy match in Petersburg, so
 30467	with the same object in view he came to Moscow. There he wavered between
 30468	the two richest heiresses, Julie and Princess Mary. Though Princess
 30469	Mary despite her plainness seemed to him more attractive than Julie, he,
 30470	without knowing why, felt awkward about paying court to her. When they
 30471	had last met on the old princeâs name day, she had answered at random
 30472	all his attempts to talk sentimentally, evidently not listening to what
 30473	he was saying.
 30474	
 30475	Julie on the contrary accepted his attentions readily, though in a
 30476	manner peculiar to herself.
 30477	
 30478	She was twenty-seven. After the death of her brothers she had become
 30479	very wealthy. She was by now decidedly plain, but thought herself not
 30480	merely as good-looking as before but even far more attractive. She
 30481	was confirmed in this delusion by the fact that she had become a very
 30482	wealthy heiress and also by the fact that the older she grew the less
 30483	dangerous she became to men, and the more freely they could associate
 30484	with her and avail themselves of her suppers, soirees, and the animated
 30485	company that assembled at her house, without incurring any obligation.
 30486	A man who would have been afraid ten years before of going every day
 30487	to the house when there was a girl of seventeen there, for fear of
 30488	compromising her and committing himself, would now go boldly every day
 30489	and treat her not as a marriageable girl but as a sexless acquaintance.
 30490	
 30491	That winter the KarÃ¡ginsâ house was the most agreeable and hospitable
 30492	in Moscow. In addition to the formal evening and dinner parties, a large
 30493	company, chiefly of men, gathered there every day, supping at midnight
 30494	and staying till three in the morning. Julie never missed a ball, a
 30495	promenade, or a play. Her dresses were always of the latest fashion.
 30496	But in spite of that she seemed to be disillusioned about everything and
 30497	told everyone that she did not believe either in friendship or in love,
 30498	or any of the joys of life, and expected peace only âyonder.â She
 30499	adopted the tone of one who has suffered a great disappointment, like a
 30500	girl who has either lost the man she loved or been cruelly deceived by
 30501	him. Though nothing of the kind had happened to her she was regarded in
 30502	that light, and had even herself come to believe that she had suffered
 30503	much in life. This melancholy, which did not prevent her amusing
 30504	herself, did not hinder the young people who came to her house from
 30505	passing the time pleasantly. Every visitor who came to the house paid
 30506	his tribute to the melancholy mood of the hostess, and then amused
 30507	himself with society gossip, dancing, intellectual games, and bouts
 30508	rimÃ©s, which were in vogue at the KarÃ¡ginsâ. Only a few of these
 30509	young men, among them BorÃ­s, entered more deeply into Julieâs
 30510	melancholy, and with these she had prolonged conversations in private
 30511	on the vanity of all worldly things, and to them she showed her albums
 30512	filled with mournful sketches, maxims, and verses.
 30513	
 30514	To BorÃ­s, Julie was particularly gracious: she regretted his early
 30515	disillusionment with life, offered him such consolation of friendship
 30516	as she who had herself suffered so much could render, and showed him
 30517	her album. BorÃ­s sketched two trees in the album and wrote: âRustic
 30518	trees, your dark branches shed gloom and melancholy upon me.â
 30519	
 30520	On another page he drew a tomb, and wrote:
 30521	
 30522	    La mort est secourable et la mort est tranquille.
 30523	    Ah! contre les douleurs il nây a pas dâautre asile. *
 30524	
 30525	    * Death gives relief and death is peaceful.
 30526	
 30527	Ah! from suffering there is no other refuge.
 30528	
 30529	Julie said this was charming
 30530	
 30531	âThere is something so enchanting in the smile of melancholy,â she
 30532	said to BorÃ­s, repeating word for word a passage she had copied from a
 30533	book. âIt is a ray of light in the darkness, a shade between sadness
 30534	and despair, showing the possibility of consolation.â
 30535	
 30536	In reply BorÃ­s wrote these lines:
 30537	
 30538	    Aliment de poison dâune Ã¢me trop sensible,
 30539	    Toi, sans qui le bonheur me serait impossible,
 30540	    Tendre mÃ©lancholie, ah, viens me consoler,
 30541	    Viens calmer les tourments de ma sombre retraite,
 30542	    Et mÃªle une douceur secrÃ¨te
 30543	    A ces pleurs que je sens couler. *
 30544	
 30545	      *Poisonous nourishment of a too sensitive soul,
 30546	     Thou, without whom happiness would for me be impossible,
 30547	     Tender melancholy, ah, come to console me,
 30548	     Come to calm the torments of my gloomy retreat,
 30549	     And mingle a secret sweetness
 30550	     With these tears that I feel to be flowing.
 30551	
 30552	For BorÃ­s, Julie played most doleful nocturnes on her harp. BorÃ­s
 30553	read Poor Liza aloud to her, and more than once interrupted the reading
 30554	because of the emotions that choked him. Meeting at large gatherings
 30555	Julie and BorÃ­s looked on one another as the only souls who understood
 30556	one another in a world of indifferent people.
 30557	
 30558	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, who often visited the KarÃ¡gins, while playing cards
 30559	with the mother made careful inquiries as to Julieâs dowry (she was
 30560	to have two estates in PÃ©nza and the NizhegÃ³rod forests). Anna
 30561	MikhÃ¡ylovna regarded the refined sadness that united her son to the
 30562	wealthy Julie with emotion, and resignation to the Divine will.
 30563	
 30564	âYou are always charming and melancholy, my dear Julie,â she said to
 30565	the daughter. âBorÃ­s says his soul finds repose at your house. He has
 30566	suffered so many disappointments and is so sensitive,â said she to
 30567	the mother. âAh, my dear, I canât tell you how fond I have grown
 30568	of Julie latterly,â she said to her son. âBut who could help loving
 30569	her? She is an angelic being! Ah, BorÃ­s, BorÃ­s!ââshe paused.
 30570	âAnd how I pity her mother,â she went on; âtoday she showed me her
 30571	accounts and letters from PÃ©nza (they have enormous estates there), and
 30572	she, poor thing, has no one to help her, and they do cheat her so!â
 30573	
 30574	BorÃ­s smiled almost imperceptibly while listening to his mother. He
 30575	laughed blandly at her naÃ¯ve diplomacy but listened to what she had
 30576	to say, and sometimes questioned her carefully about the PÃ©nza and
 30577	NizhegÃ³rod estates.
 30578	
 30579	Julie had long been expecting a proposal from her melancholy adorer and
 30580	was ready to accept it; but some secret feeling of repulsion for her,
 30581	for her passionate desire to get married, for her artificiality, and
 30582	a feeling of horror at renouncing the possibility of real love still
 30583	restrained BorÃ­s. His leave was expiring. He spent every day and whole
 30584	days at the KarÃ¡ginsâ, and every day on thinking the matter over
 30585	told himself that he would propose tomorrow. But in Julieâs presence,
 30586	looking at her red face and chin (nearly always powdered), her moist
 30587	eyes, and her expression of continual readiness to pass at once from
 30588	melancholy to an unnatural rapture of married bliss, BorÃ­s could not
 30589	utter the decisive words, though in imagination he had long regarded
 30590	himself as the possessor of those PÃ©nza and NizhegÃ³rod estates and
 30591	had apportioned the use of the income from them. Julie saw BorÃ­sâ
 30592	indecision, and sometimes the thought occurred to her that she was
 30593	repulsive to him, but her feminine self-deception immediately supplied
 30594	her with consolation, and she told herself that he was only shy from
 30595	love. Her melancholy, however, began to turn to irritability, and not
 30596	long before BorÃ­sâ departure she formed a definite plan of action.
 30597	Just as BorÃ­sâ leave of absence was expiring, Anatole KurÃ¡gin made
 30598	his appearance in Moscow, and of course in the KarÃ¡ginsâ drawing
 30599	room, and Julie, suddenly abandoning her melancholy, became cheerful and
 30600	very attentive to KurÃ¡gin.
 30601	
 30602	âMy dear,â said Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna to her son, âI know from a
 30603	reliable source that Prince VasÃ­li has sent his son to Moscow to get
 30604	him married to Julie. I am so fond of Julie that I should be sorry for
 30605	her. What do you think of it, my dear?â
 30606	
 30607	The idea of being made a fool of and of having thrown away that whole
 30608	month of arduous melancholy service to Julie, and of seeing all
 30609	the revenue from the PÃ©nza estates which he had already mentally
 30610	apportioned and put to proper use fall into the hands of another, and
 30611	especially into the hands of that idiot Anatole, pained BorÃ­s. He drove
 30612	to the KarÃ¡ginsâ with the firm intention of proposing. Julie met
 30613	him in a gay, careless manner, spoke casually of how she had enjoyed
 30614	yesterdayâs ball, and asked when he was leaving. Though BorÃ­s had
 30615	come intentionally to speak of his love and therefore meant to be
 30616	tender, he began speaking irritably of feminine inconstancy, of how
 30617	easily women can turn from sadness to joy, and how their moods depend
 30618	solely on who happens to be paying court to them. Julie was offended and
 30619	replied that it was true that a woman needs variety, and the same thing
 30620	over and over again would weary anyone.
 30621	
 30622	âThen I should advise you...â BorÃ­s began, wishing to sting her;
 30623	but at that instant the galling thought occurred to him that he might
 30624	have to leave Moscow without having accomplished his aim, and have
 30625	vainly wasted his effortsâwhich was a thing he never allowed to
 30626	happen.
 30627	
 30628	He checked himself in the middle of the sentence, lowered his eyes to
 30629	avoid seeing her unpleasantly irritated and irresolute face, and said:
 30630	
 30631	âI did not come here at all to quarrel with you. On the contrary...â
 30632	
 30633	He glanced at her to make sure that he might go on. Her irritability had
 30634	suddenly quite vanished, and her anxious, imploring eyes were fixed on
 30635	him with greedy expectation. âI can always arrange so as not to see
 30636	her often,â thought BorÃ­s. âThe affair has been begun and must be
 30637	finished!â He blushed hotly, raised his eyes to hers, and said:
 30638	
 30639	âYou know my feelings for you!â
 30640	
 30641	There was no need to say more: Julieâs face shone with triumph and
 30642	self-satisfaction; but she forced BorÃ­s to say all that is said on such
 30643	occasionsâthat he loved her and had never loved any other woman more
 30644	than her. She knew that for the PÃ©nza estates and NizhegÃ³rod forests
 30645	she could demand this, and she received what she demanded.
 30646	
 30647	The affianced couple, no longer alluding to trees that shed gloom and
 30648	melancholy upon them, planned the arrangements of a splendid house in
 30649	Petersburg, paid calls, and prepared everything for a brilliant wedding.
 30650

 30654	
 30655	CHAPTER VI
 30656	
 30657	At the end of January old Count RostÃ³v went to Moscow with NatÃ¡sha and
 30658	SÃ³nya. The countess was still unwell and unable to travel but it was
 30659	impossible to wait for her recovery. Prince Andrew was expected in
 30660	Moscow any day, the trousseau had to be ordered and the estate near
 30661	Moscow had to be sold, besides which the opportunity of presenting his
 30662	future daughter-in-law to old Prince BolkÃ³nski while he was in Moscow
 30663	could not be missed. The RostÃ³vsâ Moscow house had not been heated
 30664	that winter and, as they had come only for a short time and the countess
 30665	was not with them, the count decided to stay with MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna
 30666	AkhrosÃ­mova, who had long been pressing her hospitality on them.
 30667	
 30668	Late one evening the RostÃ³vsâ four sleighs drove into MÃ¡rya
 30669	DmÃ­trievnaâs courtyard in the old KonyÃºsheny street. MÃ¡rya
 30670	DmÃ­trievna lived alone. She had already married off her daughter, and
 30671	her sons were all in the service.
 30672	
 30673	She held herself as erect, told everyone her opinion as candidly,
 30674	loudly, and bluntly as ever, and her whole bearing seemed a reproach
 30675	to others for any weakness, passion, or temptationâthe possibility of
 30676	which she did not admit. From early in the morning, wearing a dressing
 30677	jacket, she attended to her household affairs, and then she drove out:
 30678	on holy days to church and after the service to jails and prisons on
 30679	affairs of which she never spoke to anyone. On ordinary days, after
 30680	dressing, she received petitioners of various classes, of whom there
 30681	were always some. Then she had dinner, a substantial and appetizing meal
 30682	at which there were always three or four guests; after dinner she played
 30683	a game of boston, and at night she had the newspapers or a new book read
 30684	to her while she knitted. She rarely made an exception and went out to
 30685	pay visits, and then only to the most important persons in the town.
 30686	
 30687	She had not yet gone to bed when the RostÃ³vs arrived and the pulley of
 30688	the hall door squeaked from the cold as it let in the RostÃ³vs and their
 30689	servants. MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna, with her spectacles hanging down on her
 30690	nose and her head flung back, stood in the hall doorway looking with
 30691	a stern, grim face at the new arrivals. One might have thought she was
 30692	angry with the travelers and would immediately turn them out, had she
 30693	not at the same time been giving careful instructions to the servants
 30694	for the accommodation of the visitors and their belongings.
 30695	
 30696	âThe countâs things? Bring them here,â she said, pointing to the
 30697	portmanteaus and not greeting anyone. âThe young ladiesâ? There
 30698	to the left. Now what are you dawdling for?â she cried to the maids.
 30699	âGet the samovar ready!... Youâve grown plumper and prettier,â she
 30700	remarked, drawing NatÃ¡sha (whose cheeks were glowing from the cold)
 30701	to her by the hood. âFoo! You are cold! Now take off your things,
 30702	quick!â she shouted to the count who was going to kiss her hand.
 30703	âYouâre half frozen, Iâm sure! Bring some rum for tea!... Bonjour,
 30704	SÃ³nya dear!â she added, turning to SÃ³nya and indicating by this
 30705	French greeting her slightly contemptuous though affectionate attitude
 30706	toward her.
 30707	
 30708	When they came in to tea, having taken off their outdoor things and
 30709	tidied themselves up after their journey, MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna kissed them
 30710	all in due order.
 30711	
 30712	âIâm heartily glad you have come and are staying with me. It was
 30713	high time,â she said, giving NatÃ¡sha a significant look. âThe old
 30714	man is here and his sonâs expected any day. Youâll have to make his
 30715	acquaintance. But weâll speak of that later on,â she added, glancing
 30716	at SÃ³nya with a look that showed she did not want to speak of it in her
 30717	presence. âNow listen,â she said to the count. âWhat do you want
 30718	tomorrow? Whom will you send for? ShinshÃ­n?â she crooked one of her
 30719	fingers. âThe sniveling Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna? Thatâs two. Sheâs here
 30720	with her son. The son is getting married! Then BezÃºkhov, eh? He is here
 30721	too, with his wife. He ran away from her and she came galloping after
 30722	him. He dined with me on Wednesday. As for themââand she pointed to
 30723	the girlsââtomorrow Iâll take them first to the Iberian shrine
 30724	of the Mother of God, and then weâll drive to the Super-Rogueâs.
 30725	I suppose youâll have everything new. Donât judge by me: sleeves
 30726	nowadays are this size! The other day young Princess IrÃ­na VasÃ­levna
 30727	came to see me; she was an awful sightâlooked as if she had put two
 30728	barrels on her arms. You know not a day passes now without some new
 30729	fashion.... And what have you to do yourself?â she asked the count
 30730	sternly.
 30731	
 30732	âOne thing has come on top of another: her rags to buy, and now a
 30733	purchaser has turned up for the Moscow estate and for the house. If you
 30734	will be so kind, Iâll fix a time and go down to the estate just for a
 30735	day, and leave my lassies with you.â
 30736	
 30737	âAll right. All right. Theyâll be safe with me, as safe as in
 30738	Chancery! Iâll take them where they must go, scold them a bit, and
 30739	pet them a bit,â said MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna, touching her goddaughter and
 30740	favorite, NatÃ¡sha, on the cheek with her large hand.
 30741	
 30742	Next morning MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna took the young ladies to the Iberian
 30743	shrine of the Mother of God and to Madame Suppert-Roguet, who was so
 30744	afraid of MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna that she always let her have costumes at
 30745	a loss merely to get rid of her. MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna ordered almost the
 30746	whole trousseau. When they got home she turned everybody out of the room
 30747	except NatÃ¡sha, and then called her pet to her armchair.
 30748	
 30749	âWell, now weâll talk. I congratulate you on your betrothed.
 30750	Youâve hooked a fine fellow! I am glad for your sake and Iâve known
 30751	him since he was so high.â She held her hand a couple of feet from the
 30752	ground. NatÃ¡sha blushed happily. âI like him and all his family.
 30753	Now listen! You know that old Prince Nicholas much dislikes his sonâs
 30754	marrying. The old fellowâs crotchety! Of course Prince Andrew is not
 30755	a child and can shift without him, but itâs not nice to enter a family
 30756	against a fatherâs will. One wants to do it peacefully and lovingly.
 30757	Youâre a clever girl and youâll know how to manage. Be kind, and use
 30758	your wits. Then all will be well.â
 30759	
 30760	NatÃ¡sha remained silent, from shyness MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna supposed, but
 30761	really because she disliked anyone interfering in what touched her love
 30762	of Prince Andrew, which seemed to her so apart from all human affairs
 30763	that no one could understand it. She loved and knew Prince Andrew, he
 30764	loved her only, and was to come one of these days and take her. She
 30765	wanted nothing more.
 30766	
 30767	âYou see I have known him a long time and am also fond of Mary, your
 30768	future sister-in-law. âHusbandsâ sisters bring up blisters,â
 30769	but this one wouldnât hurt a fly. She has asked me to bring you two
 30770	together. Tomorrow youâll go with your father to see her. Be very
 30771	nice and affectionate to her: youâre younger than she. When he comes,
 30772	heâll find you already know his sister and father and are liked by
 30773	them. Am I right or not? Wonât that be best?â
 30774	
 30775	âYes, it will,â NatÃ¡sha answered reluctantly.
 30776	
 30777	
 30778	
 30779	
 30780	
 30781	CHAPTER VII
 30782	
 30783	Next day, by MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievnaâs advice, Count RostÃ³v took NatÃ¡sha
 30784	to call on Prince Nicholas BolkÃ³nski. The count did not set out
 30785	cheerfully on this visit, at heart he felt afraid. He well remembered
 30786	the last interview he had had with the old prince at the time of the
 30787	enrollment, when in reply to an invitation to dinner he had had to
 30788	listen to an angry reprimand for not having provided his full quota of
 30789	men. NatÃ¡sha, on the other hand, having put on her best gown, was in
 30790	the highest spirits. âThey canât help liking me,â she thought.
 30791	âEverybody always has liked me, and I am so willing to do anything
 30792	they wish, so ready to be fond of himâfor being his fatherâand of
 30793	herâfor being his sisterâthat there is no reason for them not to
 30794	like me....â
 30795	
 30796	They drove up to the gloomy old house on the VozdvÃ­zhenka and entered
 30797	the vestibule.
 30798	
 30799	âWell, the Lord have mercy on us!â said the count, half in jest,
 30800	half in earnest; but NatÃ¡sha noticed that her father was flurried on
 30801	entering the anteroom and inquired timidly and softly whether the prince
 30802	and princess were at home.
 30803	
 30804	When they had been announced a perturbation was noticeable among the
 30805	servants. The footman who had gone to announce them was stopped by
 30806	another in the large hall and they whispered to one another. Then a
 30807	maidservant ran into the hall and hurriedly said something, mentioning
 30808	the princess. At last an old, cross looking footman came and announced
 30809	to the RostÃ³vs that the prince was not receiving, but that the princess
 30810	begged them to walk up. The first person who came to meet the visitors
 30811	was Mademoiselle Bourienne. She greeted the father and daughter
 30812	with special politeness and showed them to the princessâ room. The
 30813	princess, looking excited and nervous, her face flushed in patches, ran
 30814	in to meet the visitors, treading heavily, and vainly trying to appear
 30815	cordial and at ease. From the first glance Princess Mary did not like
 30816	NatÃ¡sha. She thought her too fashionably dressed, frivolously gay and
 30817	vain. She did not at all realize that before having seen her future
 30818	sister-in-law she was prejudiced against her by involuntary envy of her
 30819	beauty, youth, and happiness, as well as by jealousy of her brotherâs
 30820	love for her. Apart from this insuperable antipathy to her, Princess
 30821	Mary was agitated just then because on the RostÃ³vsâ being announced,
 30822	the old prince had shouted that he did not wish to see them, that
 30823	Princess Mary might do so if she chose, but they were not to be admitted
 30824	to him. She had decided to receive them, but feared lest the prince
 30825	might at any moment indulge in some freak, as he seemed much upset by
 30826	the RostÃ³vsâ visit.
 30827	
 30828	âThere, my dear princess, Iâve brought you my songstress,â said
 30829	the count, bowing and looking round uneasily as if afraid the old prince
 30830	might appear. âI am so glad you should get to know one another... very
 30831	sorry the prince is still ailing,â and after a few more commonplace
 30832	remarks he rose. âIf youâll allow me to leave my NatÃ¡sha in your
 30833	hands for a quarter of an hour, Princess, Iâll drive round to see Anna
 30834	SemÃ«novna, itâs quite near in the Dogsâ Square, and then Iâll
 30835	come back for her.â
 30836	
 30837	The count had devised this diplomatic ruse (as he afterwards told his
 30838	daughter) to give the future sisters-in-law an opportunity to talk
 30839	to one another freely, but another motive was to avoid the danger of
 30840	encountering the old prince, of whom he was afraid. He did not mention
 30841	this to his daughter, but NatÃ¡sha noticed her fatherâs nervousness
 30842	and anxiety and felt mortified by it. She blushed for him, grew still
 30843	angrier at having blushed, and looked at the princess with a bold and
 30844	defiant expression which said that she was not afraid of anybody. The
 30845	princess told the count that she would be delighted, and only begged him
 30846	to stay longer at Anna SemÃ«novnaâs, and he departed.
 30847	
 30848	Despite the uneasy glances thrown at her by Princess Maryâwho wished
 30849	to have a tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte with NatÃ¡shaâMademoiselle Bourienne
 30850	remained in the room and persistently talked about Moscow amusements and
 30851	theaters. NatÃ¡sha felt offended by the hesitation she had noticed in
 30852	the anteroom, by her fatherâs nervousness, and by the unnatural manner
 30853	of the princess whoâshe thoughtâwas making a favor of receiving her,
 30854	and so everything displeased her. She did not like Princess Mary, whom
 30855	she thought very plain, affected, and dry. NatÃ¡sha suddenly shrank
 30856	into herself and involuntarily assumed an offhand air which alienated
 30857	Princess Mary still more. After five minutes of irksome, constrained
 30858	conversation, they heard the sound of slippered feet rapidly
 30859	approaching. Princess Mary looked frightened.
 30860	
 30861	The door opened and the old prince, in a dressing gown and a white
 30862	nightcap, came in.
 30863	
 30864	âAh, madam!â he began. âMadam, Countess... Countess RostÃ³va, if
 30865	I am not mistaken... I beg you to excuse me, to excuse me... I did not
 30866	know, madam. God is my witness, I did not know you had honored us with
 30867	a visit, and I came in such a costume only to see my daughter. I beg you
 30868	to excuse me... God is my witness, I didnât knowââ he repeated,
 30869	stressing the word âGodâ so unnaturally and so unpleasantly that
 30870	Princess Mary stood with downcast eyes not daring to look either at her
 30871	father or at NatÃ¡sha.
 30872	
 30873	Nor did the latter, having risen and curtsied, know what to do.
 30874	Mademoiselle Bourienne alone smiled agreeably.
 30875	
 30876	âI beg you to excuse me, excuse me! God is my witness, I did not
 30877	know,â muttered the old man, and after looking NatÃ¡sha over from head
 30878	to foot he went out.
 30879	
 30880	Mademoiselle Bourienne was the first to recover herself after this
 30881	apparition and began speaking about the princeâs indisposition.
 30882	NatÃ¡sha and Princess Mary looked at one another in silence, and the
 30883	longer they did so without saying what they wanted to say, the greater
 30884	grew their antipathy to one another.
 30885	
 30886	When the count returned, NatÃ¡sha was impolitely pleased and hastened
 30887	to get away: at that moment she hated the stiff, elderly princess, who
 30888	could place her in such an embarrassing position and had spent half an
 30889	hour with her without once mentioning Prince Andrew. âI couldnât
 30890	begin talking about him in the presence of that Frenchwoman,â thought
 30891	NatÃ¡sha. The same thought was meanwhile tormenting Princess Mary. She
 30892	knew what she ought to have said to NatÃ¡sha, but she had been unable
 30893	to say it because Mademoiselle Bourienne was in the way, and because,
 30894	without knowing why, she felt it very difficult to speak of the
 30895	marriage. When the count was already leaving the room, Princess Mary
 30896	went up hurriedly to NatÃ¡sha, took her by the hand, and said with a
 30897	deep sigh:
 30898	
 30899	âWait, I must...â
 30900	
 30901	NatÃ¡sha glanced at her ironically without knowing why.
 30902	
 30903	âDear Natalie,â said Princess Mary, âI want you to know that I am
 30904	glad my brother has found happiness....â
 30905	
 30906	She paused, feeling that she was not telling the truth. NatÃ¡sha noticed
 30907	this and guessed its reason.
 30908	
 30909	âI think, Princess, it is not convenient to speak of that now,â
 30910	she said with external dignity and coldness, though she felt the tears
 30911	choking her.
 30912	
 30913	âWhat have I said and what have I done?â thought she, as soon as she
 30914	was out of the room.
 30915	
 30916	They waited a long time for NatÃ¡sha to come to dinner that day. She sat
 30917	in her room crying like a child, blowing her nose and sobbing. SÃ³nya
 30918	stood beside her, kissing her hair.
 30919	
 30920	âNatÃ¡sha, what is it about?â she asked. âWhat do they matter to
 30921	you? It will all pass, NatÃ¡sha.â
 30922	
 30923	âBut if you only knew how offensive it was... as if I...â
 30924	
 30925	âDonât talk about it, NatÃ¡sha. It wasnât your fault so why should
 30926	you mind? Kiss me,â said SÃ³nya.
 30927	
 30928	NatÃ¡sha raised her head and, kissing her friend on the lips, pressed
 30929	her wet face against her.
 30930	
 30931	âI canât tell you, I donât know. No oneâs to blame,â said
 30932	NatÃ¡shaââItâs my fault. But it all hurts terribly. Oh, why
 30933	doesnât he come?...â
 30934	
 30935	She came in to dinner with red eyes. MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna, who knew how
 30936	the prince had received the RostÃ³vs, pretended not to notice how upset
 30937	NatÃ¡sha was and jested resolutely and loudly at table with the count
 30938	and the other guests.
 30939	
 30940	
 30941	
 30942	
 30943	
 30944	CHAPTER VIII
 30945	
 30946	That evening the RostÃ³vs went to the Opera, for which MÃ¡rya
 30947	DmÃ­trievna had taken a box.
 30948	
 30949	NatÃ¡sha did not want to go, but could not refuse MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievnaâs
 30950	kind offer which was intended expressly for her. When she came ready
 30951	dressed into the ballroom to await her father, and looking in the large
 30952	mirror there saw that she was pretty, very pretty, she felt even more
 30953	sad, but it was a sweet, tender sadness.
 30954	
 30955	âO God, if he were here now I would not behave as I did then, but
 30956	differently. I would not be silly and afraid of things, I would simply
 30957	embrace him, cling to him, and make him look at me with those searching
 30958	inquiring eyes with which he has so often looked at me, and then I
 30959	would make him laugh as he used to laugh. And his eyesâhow I see those
 30960	eyes!â thought NatÃ¡sha. âAnd what do his father and sister matter
 30961	to me? I love him alone, him, him, with that face and those eyes, with
 30962	his smile, manly and yet childlike.... No, I had better not think of
 30963	him; not think of him but forget him, quite forget him for the present.
 30964	I canât bear this waiting and I shall cry in a minute!â and she
 30965	turned away from the glass, making an effort not to cry. âAnd how
 30966	can SÃ³nya love Nicholas so calmly and quietly and wait so long and so
 30967	patiently?â thought she, looking at SÃ³nya, who also came in quite
 30968	ready, with a fan in her hand. âNo, sheâs altogether different. I
 30969	canât!â
 30970	
 30971	NatÃ¡sha at that moment felt so softened and tender that it was not
 30972	enough for her to love and know she was beloved, she wanted now, at
 30973	once, to embrace the man she loved, to speak and hear from him words of
 30974	love such as filled her heart. While she sat in the carriage beside her
 30975	father, pensively watching the lights of the street lamps flickering on
 30976	the frozen window, she felt still sadder and more in love, and forgot
 30977	where she was going and with whom. Having fallen into the line of
 30978	carriages, the RostÃ³vsâ carriage drove up to the theater, its wheels
 30979	squeaking over the snow. NatÃ¡sha and SÃ³nya, holding up their dresses,
 30980	jumped out quickly. The count got out helped by the footmen, and,
 30981	passing among men and women who were entering and the program sellers,
 30982	they all three went along the corridor to the first row of boxes.
 30983	Through the closed doors the music was already audible.
 30984	
 30985	âNatÃ¡sha, your hair!...â whispered SÃ³nya.
 30986	
 30987	An attendant deferentially and quickly slipped before the ladies and
 30988	opened the door of their box. The music sounded louder and through the
 30989	door rows of brightly lit boxes in which ladies sat with bare arms and
 30990	shoulders, and noisy stalls brilliant with uniforms, glittered before
 30991	their eyes. A lady entering the next box shot a glance of feminine envy
 30992	at NatÃ¡sha. The curtain had not yet risen and the overture was being
 30993	played. NatÃ¡sha, smoothing her gown, went in with SÃ³nya and sat down,
 30994	scanning the brilliant tiers of boxes opposite. A sensation she had not
 30995	experienced for a long timeâthat of hundreds of eyes looking at
 30996	her bare arms and neckâsuddenly affected her both agreeably and
 30997	disagreeably and called up a whole crowd of memories, desires and
 30998	emotions associated with that feeling.
 30999	
 31000	The two remarkably pretty girls, NatÃ¡sha and SÃ³nya, with Count RostÃ³v
 31001	who had not been seen in Moscow for a long time, attracted general
 31002	attention. Moreover, everybody knew vaguely of NatÃ¡shaâs engagement
 31003	to Prince Andrew, and knew that the RostÃ³vs had lived in the country
 31004	ever since, and all looked with curiosity at a fiancÃ©e who was making
 31005	one of the best matches in Russia.
 31006	
 31007	NatÃ¡shaâs looks, as everyone told her, had improved in the country,
 31008	and that evening thanks to her agitation she was particularly pretty.
 31009	She struck those who saw her by her fullness of life and beauty,
 31010	combined with her indifference to everything about her. Her black eyes
 31011	looked at the crowd without seeking anyone, and her delicate arm, bare
 31012	to above the elbow, lay on the velvet edge of the box, while, evidently
 31013	unconsciously, she opened and closed her hand in time to the music,
 31014	crumpling her program. âLook, thereâs AlÃ©nina,â said SÃ³nya,
 31015	âwith her mother, isnât it?â
 31016	
 31017	âDear me, Michael KirÃ­lovich has grown still stouter!â remarked the
 31018	count.
 31019	
 31020	âLook at our Anna MikhÃ¡ylovnaâwhat a headdress she has on!â
 31021	
 31022	âThe KarÃ¡gins, Julieâand BorÃ­s with them. One can see at once that
 31023	theyâre engaged....â
 31024	
 31025	âDrubetskÃ³y has proposed?â
 31026	
 31027	âOh yes, I heard it today,â said ShinshÃ­n, coming into the
 31028	RostÃ³vsâ box.
 31029	
 31030	NatÃ¡sha looked in the direction in which her fatherâs eyes were
 31031	turned and saw Julie sitting beside her mother with a happy look on her
 31032	face and a string of pearls round her thick red neckâwhich NatÃ¡sha
 31033	knew was covered with powder. Behind them, wearing a smile and leaning
 31034	over with an ear to Julieâs mouth, was BorÃ­sâ handsome smoothly
 31035	brushed head. He looked at the RostÃ³vs from under his brows and said
 31036	something, smiling, to his betrothed.
 31037	
 31038	âThey are talking about us, about me and him!â thought NatÃ¡sha.
 31039	âAnd he no doubt is calming her jealousy of me. They neednât trouble
 31040	themselves! If only they knew how little I am concerned about any of
 31041	them.â
 31042	
 31043	Behind them sat Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna wearing a green headdress and with a
 31044	happy look of resignation to the will of God on her face. Their box was
 31045	pervaded by that atmosphere of an affianced couple which NatÃ¡sha knew
 31046	so well and liked so much. She turned away and suddenly remembered all
 31047	that had been so humiliating in her morningâs visit.
 31048	
 31049	âWhat right has he not to wish to receive me into his family? Oh,
 31050	better not think of itânot till he comes back!â she told herself,
 31051	and began looking at the faces, some strange and some familiar, in
 31052	the stalls. In the front, in the very center, leaning back against
 31053	the orchestra rail, stood DÃ³lokhov in a Persian dress, his curly hair
 31054	brushed up into a huge shock. He stood in full view of the audience,
 31055	well aware that he was attracting everyoneâs attention, yet as much at
 31056	ease as though he were in his own room. Around him thronged Moscowâs
 31057	most brilliant young men, whom he evidently dominated.
 31058	
 31059	The count, laughing, nudged the blushing SÃ³nya and pointed to her
 31060	former adorer.
 31061	
 31062	âDo you recognize him?â said he. âAnd where has he sprung from?â
 31063	he asked, turning to ShinshÃ­n. âDidnât he vanish somewhere?â
 31064	
 31065	âHe did,â replied ShinshÃ­n. âHe was in the Caucasus and ran
 31066	away from there. They say he has been acting as minister to some ruling
 31067	prince in Persia, where he killed the Shahâs brother. Now all the
 31068	Moscow ladies are mad about him! Itâs âDÃ³lokhov the Persianâ that
 31069	does it! We never hear a word but DÃ³lokhov is mentioned. They swear
 31070	by him, they offer him to you as they would a dish of choice sterlet.
 31071	DÃ³lokhov and Anatole KurÃ¡gin have turned all our ladiesâ heads.â
 31072	
 31073	A tall, beautiful woman with a mass of plaited hair and much exposed
 31074	plump white shoulders and neck, round which she wore a double string of
 31075	large pearls, entered the adjoining box rustling her heavy silk dress
 31076	and took a long time settling into her place.
 31077	
 31078	NatÃ¡sha involuntarily gazed at that neck, those shoulders, and pearls
 31079	and coiffure, and admired the beauty of the shoulders and the pearls.
 31080	While NatÃ¡sha was fixing her gaze on her for the second time the lady
 31081	looked round and, meeting the countâs eyes, nodded to him and smiled.
 31082	She was the Countess BezÃºkhova, Pierreâs wife, and the count, who
 31083	knew everyone in society, leaned over and spoke to her.
 31084	
 31085	âHave you been here long, Countess?â he inquired. âIâll call,
 31086	Iâll call to kiss your hand. Iâm here on business and have brought
 31087	my girls with me. They say SemÃ«nova acts marvelously. Count Pierre
 31088	never used to forget us. Is he here?â
 31089	
 31090	âYes, he meant to look in,â answered HÃ©lÃ¨ne, and glanced
 31091	attentively at NatÃ¡sha.
 31092	
 31093	Count RostÃ³v resumed his seat.
 31094	
 31095	âHandsome, isnât she?â he whispered to NatÃ¡sha.
 31096	
 31097	âWonderful!â answered NatÃ¡sha. âSheâs a woman one could easily
 31098	fall in love with.â
 31099	
 31100	Just then the last chords of the overture were heard and the conductor
 31101	tapped with his stick. Some latecomers took their seats in the stalls,
 31102	and the curtain rose.
 31103	
 31104	As soon as it rose everyone in the boxes and stalls became silent, and
 31105	all the men, old and young, in uniform and evening dress, and all the
 31106	women with gems on their bare flesh, turned their whole attention with
 31107	eager curiosity to the stage. NatÃ¡sha too began to look at it.
 31108	
 31109	
 31110	
 31111	
 31112	
 31113	CHAPTER IX
 31114	
 31115	The floor of the stage consisted of smooth boards, at the sides was
 31116	some painted cardboard representing trees, and at the back was a cloth
 31117	stretched over boards. In the center of the stage sat some girls in red
 31118	bodices and white skirts. One very fat girl in a white silk dress sat
 31119	apart on a low bench, to the back of which a piece of green cardboard
 31120	was glued. They all sang something. When they had finished their song
 31121	the girl in white went up to the prompterâs box and a man with tight
 31122	silk trousers over his stout legs, and holding a plume and a dagger,
 31123	went up to her and began singing, waving his arms about.
 31124	
 31125	First the man in the tight trousers sang alone, then she sang, then they
 31126	both paused while the orchestra played and the man fingered the hand
 31127	of the girl in white, obviously awaiting the beat to start singing with
 31128	her. They sang together and everyone in the theater began clapping
 31129	and shouting, while the man and woman on the stageâwho represented
 31130	loversâbegan smiling, spreading out their arms, and bowing.
 31131	
 31132	After her life in the country, and in her present serious mood, all this
 31133	seemed grotesque and amazing to NatÃ¡sha. She could not follow the opera
 31134	nor even listen to the music; she saw only the painted cardboard and the
 31135	queerly dressed men and women who moved, spoke, and sang so strangely in
 31136	that brilliant light. She knew what it was all meant to represent, but
 31137	it was so pretentiously false and unnatural that she first felt ashamed
 31138	for the actors and then amused at them. She looked at the faces of the
 31139	audience, seeking in them the same sense of ridicule and perplexity she
 31140	herself experienced, but they all seemed attentive to what was happening
 31141	on the stage, and expressed delight which to NatÃ¡sha seemed feigned.
 31142	âI suppose it has to be like this!â she thought. She kept looking
 31143	round in turn at the rows of pomaded heads in the stalls and then at
 31144	the seminude women in the boxes, especially at HÃ©lÃ¨ne in the next box,
 31145	whoâapparently quite unclothedâsat with a quiet tranquil smile, not
 31146	taking her eyes off the stage. And feeling the bright light that flooded
 31147	the whole place and the warm air heated by the crowd, NatÃ¡sha little
 31148	by little began to pass into a state of intoxication she had not
 31149	experienced for a long while. She did not realize who and where she
 31150	was, nor what was going on before her. As she looked and thought, the
 31151	strangest fancies unexpectedly and disconnectedly passed through her
 31152	mind: the idea occurred to her of jumping onto the edge of the box and
 31153	singing the air the actress was singing, then she wished to touch with
 31154	her fan an old gentleman sitting not far from her, then to lean over to
 31155	HÃ©lÃ¨ne and tickle her.
 31156	
 31157	At a moment when all was quiet before the commencement of a song, a door
 31158	leading to the stalls on the side nearest the RostÃ³vsâ box creaked,
 31159	and the steps of a belated arrival were heard. âThereâs KurÃ¡gin!â
 31160	whispered ShinshÃ­n. Countess BezÃºkhova turned smiling to the newcomer,
 31161	and NatÃ¡sha, following the direction of that look, saw an exceptionally
 31162	handsome adjutant approaching their box with a self-assured yet
 31163	courteous bearing. This was Anatole KurÃ¡gin whom she had seen
 31164	and noticed long ago at the ball in Petersburg. He was now in an
 31165	adjutantâs uniform with one epaulet and a shoulder knot. He moved with
 31166	a restrained swagger which would have been ridiculous had he not been
 31167	so good-looking and had his handsome face not worn such an expression
 31168	of good-humored complacency and gaiety. Though the performance was
 31169	proceeding, he walked deliberately down the carpeted gangway, his sword
 31170	and spurs slightly jingling and his handsome perfumed head held high.
 31171	Having looked at NatÃ¡sha he approached his sister, laid his well gloved
 31172	hand on the edge of her box, nodded to her, and leaning forward asked a
 31173	question, with a motion toward NatÃ¡sha.
 31174	
 31175	âMais charmante!â said he, evidently referring to NatÃ¡sha, who did
 31176	not exactly hear his words but understood them from the movement of his
 31177	lips. Then he took his place in the first row of the stalls and sat down
 31178	beside DÃ³lokhov, nudging with his elbow in a friendly and offhand way
 31179	that DÃ³lokhov whom others treated so fawningly. He winked at him gaily,
 31180	smiled, and rested his foot against the orchestra screen.
 31181	
 31182	âHow like the brother is to the sister,â remarked the count. âAnd
 31183	how handsome they both are!â
 31184	
 31185	ShinshÃ­n, lowering his voice, began to tell the count of some intrigue
 31186	of KurÃ¡ginâs in Moscow, and NatÃ¡sha tried to overhear it just
 31187	because he had said she was âcharmante.â
 31188	
 31189	The first act was over. In the stalls everyone began moving about, going
 31190	out and coming in.
 31191	
 31192	BorÃ­s came to the RostÃ³vsâ box, received their congratulations very
 31193	simply, and raising his eyebrows with an absent-minded smile conveyed to
 31194	NatÃ¡sha and SÃ³nya his fiancÃ©eâs invitation to her wedding, and
 31195	went away. NatÃ¡sha with a gay, coquettish smile talked to him, and
 31196	congratulated on his approaching wedding that same BorÃ­s with whom
 31197	she had formerly been in love. In the state of intoxication she was in,
 31198	everything seemed simple and natural.
 31199	
 31200	The scantily clad HÃ©lÃ¨ne smiled at everyone in the same way, and
 31201	NatÃ¡sha gave BorÃ­s a similar smile.
 31202	
 31203	HÃ©lÃ¨neâs box was filled and surrounded from the stalls by the most
 31204	distinguished and intellectual men, who seemed to vie with one another
 31205	in their wish to let everyone see that they knew her.
 31206	
 31207	During the whole of that entrâacte KurÃ¡gin stood with DÃ³lokhov
 31208	in front of the orchestra partition, looking at the RostÃ³vsâ box.
 31209	NatÃ¡sha knew he was talking about her and this afforded her pleasure.
 31210	She even turned so that he should see her profile in what she thought
 31211	was its most becoming aspect. Before the beginning of the second act
 31212	Pierre appeared in the stalls. The RostÃ³vs had not seen him since
 31213	their arrival. His face looked sad, and he had grown still stouter since
 31214	NatÃ¡sha last saw him. He passed up to the front rows, not noticing
 31215	anyone. Anatole went up to him and began speaking to him, looking at and
 31216	indicating the RostÃ³vsâ box. On seeing NatÃ¡sha Pierre grew animated
 31217	and, hastily passing between the rows, came toward their box. When he
 31218	got there he leaned on his elbows and, smiling, talked to her for a long
 31219	time. While conversing with Pierre, NatÃ¡sha heard a manâs voice in
 31220	Countess BezÃºkhovaâs box and something told her it was KurÃ¡gin. She
 31221	turned and their eyes met. Almost smiling, he gazed straight into her
 31222	eyes with such an enraptured caressing look that it seemed strange to be
 31223	so near him, to look at him like that, to be so sure he admired her, and
 31224	not to be acquainted with him.
 31225	
 31226	In the second act there was scenery representing tombstones, there was a
 31227	round hole in the canvas to represent the moon, shades were raised over
 31228	the footlights, and from horns and contrabass came deep notes while many
 31229	people appeared from right and left wearing black cloaks and holding
 31230	things like daggers in their hands. They began waving their arms. Then
 31231	some other people ran in and began dragging away the maiden who had been
 31232	in white and was now in light blue. They did not drag her away at once,
 31233	but sang with her for a long time and then at last dragged her off, and
 31234	behind the scenes something metallic was struck three times and
 31235	everyone knelt down and sang a prayer. All these things were repeatedly
 31236	interrupted by the enthusiastic shouts of the audience.
 31237	
 31238	During this act every time NatÃ¡sha looked toward the stalls she saw
 31239	Anatole KurÃ¡gin with an arm thrown across the back of his chair,
 31240	staring at her. She was pleased to see that he was captivated by her and
 31241	it did not occur to her that there was anything wrong in it.
 31242	
 31243	When the second act was over Countess BezÃºkhova rose, turned to the
 31244	RostÃ³vsâ boxâher whole bosom completely exposedâbeckoned the old
 31245	count with a gloved finger, and paying no attention to those who had
 31246	entered her box began talking to him with an amiable smile.
 31247	
 31248	âDo make me acquainted with your charming daughters,â said she.
 31249	âThe whole town is singing their praises and I donât even know
 31250	them!â
 31251	
 31252	NatÃ¡sha rose and curtsied to the splendid countess. She was so pleased
 31253	by praise from this brilliant beauty that she blushed with pleasure.
 31254	
 31255	âI want to become a Moscovite too, now,â said HÃ©lÃ¨ne. âHow is it
 31256	youâre not ashamed to bury such pearls in the country?â
 31257	
 31258	Countess BezÃºkhova quite deserved her reputation of being a fascinating
 31259	woman. She could say what she did not thinkâespecially what was
 31260	flatteringâquite simply and naturally.
 31261	
 31262	âDear count, you must let me look after your daughters! Though I am
 31263	not staying here long this timeânor are youâI will try to amuse
 31264	them. I have already heard much of you in Petersburg and wanted to get
 31265	to know you,â said she to NatÃ¡sha with her stereotyped and lovely
 31266	smile. âI had heard about you from my page, DrubetskÃ³y. Have you
 31267	heard he is getting married? And also from my husbandâs friend
 31268	BolkÃ³nski, Prince Andrew BolkÃ³nski,â she went on with special
 31269	emphasis, implying that she knew of his relation to NatÃ¡sha. To get
 31270	better acquainted she asked that one of the young ladies should come
 31271	into her box for the rest of the performance, and NatÃ¡sha moved over to
 31272	it.
 31273	
 31274	The scene of the third act represented a palace in which many candles
 31275	were burning and pictures of knights with short beards hung on the
 31276	walls. In the middle stood what were probably a king and a queen. The
 31277	king waved his right arm and, evidently nervous, sang something badly
 31278	and sat down on a crimson throne. The maiden who had been first in white
 31279	and then in light blue, now wore only a smock, and stood beside the
 31280	throne with her hair down. She sang something mournfully, addressing the
 31281	queen, but the king waved his arm severely, and men and women with bare
 31282	legs came in from both sides and began dancing all together. Then the
 31283	violins played very shrilly and merrily and one of the women with thick
 31284	bare legs and thin arms, separating from the others, went behind the
 31285	wings, adjusted her bodice, returned to the middle of the stage, and
 31286	began jumping and striking one foot rapidly against the other. In the
 31287	stalls everyone clapped and shouted âbravo!â Then one of the men
 31288	went into a corner of the stage. The cymbals and horns in the orchestra
 31289	struck up more loudly, and this man with bare legs jumped very high and
 31290	waved his feet about very rapidly. (He was Duport, who received sixty
 31291	thousand rubles a year for this art.) Everybody in the stalls, boxes,
 31292	and galleries began clapping and shouting with all their might, and the
 31293	man stopped and began smiling and bowing to all sides. Then other men
 31294	and women danced with bare legs. Then the king again shouted to the
 31295	sound of music, and they all began singing. But suddenly a storm
 31296	came on, chromatic scales and diminished sevenths were heard in the
 31297	orchestra, everyone ran off, again dragging one of their number away,
 31298	and the curtain dropped. Once more there was a terrible noise and
 31299	clatter among the audience, and with rapturous faces everyone began
 31300	shouting: âDuport! Duport! Duport!â NatÃ¡sha no longer thought this
 31301	strange. She looked about with pleasure, smiling joyfully.
 31302	
 31303	âIsnât Duport delightful?â HÃ©lÃ¨ne asked her.
 31304	
 31305	âOh, yes,â replied NatÃ¡sha.
 31306	
 31307	
 31308	
 31309	
 31310	
 31311	CHAPTER X
 31312	
 31313	During the entrâacte a whiff of cold air came into HÃ©lÃ¨neâs box,
 31314	the door opened, and Anatole entered, stooping and trying not to brush
 31315	against anyone.
 31316	
 31317	âLet me introduce my brother to you,â said HÃ©lÃ¨ne, her eyes
 31318	shifting uneasily from NatÃ¡sha to Anatole.
 31319	
 31320	NatÃ¡sha turned her pretty little head toward the elegant young officer
 31321	and smiled at him over her bare shoulder. Anatole, who was as handsome
 31322	at close quarters as at a distance, sat down beside her and told her he
 31323	had long wished to have this happinessâever since the NarÃ½shkinsâ
 31324	ball in fact, at which he had had the well-remembered pleasure of seeing
 31325	her. KurÃ¡gin was much more sensible and simple with women than among
 31326	men. He talked boldly and naturally, and NatÃ¡sha was strangely and
 31327	agreeably struck by the fact that there was nothing formidable in this
 31328	man about whom there was so much talk, but that on the contrary his
 31329	smile was most naÃ¯ve, cheerful, and good-natured.
 31330	
 31331	KurÃ¡gin asked her opinion of the performance and told her how at a
 31332	previous performance SemÃ«nova had fallen down on the stage.
 31333	
 31334	âAnd do you know, Countess,â he said, suddenly addressing her as an
 31335	old, familiar acquaintance, âwe are getting up a costume tournament;
 31336	you ought to take part in it! It will be great fun. We shall all meet at
 31337	the KarÃ¡ginsâ! Please come! No! Really, eh?â said he.
 31338	
 31339	While saying this he never removed his smiling eyes from her face,
 31340	her neck, and her bare arms. NatÃ¡sha knew for certain that he was
 31341	enraptured by her. This pleased her, yet his presence made her feel
 31342	constrained and oppressed. When she was not looking at him she felt that
 31343	he was looking at her shoulders, and she involuntarily caught his eye
 31344	so that he should look into hers rather than this. But looking into his
 31345	eyes she was frightened, realizing that there was not that barrier of
 31346	modesty she had always felt between herself and other men. She did not
 31347	know how it was that within five minutes she had come to feel herself
 31348	terribly near to this man. When she turned away she feared he might
 31349	seize her from behind by her bare arm and kiss her on the neck. They
 31350	spoke of most ordinary things, yet she felt that they were closer to
 31351	one another than she had ever been to any man. NatÃ¡sha kept turning to
 31352	HÃ©lÃ¨ne and to her father, as if asking what it all meant, but HÃ©lÃ¨ne
 31353	was engaged in conversation with a general and did not answer her
 31354	look, and her fatherâs eyes said nothing but what they always said:
 31355	âHaving a good time? Well, Iâm glad of it!â
 31356	
 31357	During one of these moments of awkward silence when Anatoleâs
 31358	prominent eyes were gazing calmly and fixedly at her, NatÃ¡sha, to break
 31359	the silence, asked him how he liked Moscow. She asked the question and
 31360	blushed. She felt all the time that by talking to him she was doing
 31361	something improper. Anatole smiled as though to encourage her.
 31362	
 31363	âAt first I did not like it much, because what makes a town pleasant
 31364	ce sont les jolies femmes, * isnât that so? But now I like it very
 31365	much indeed,â he said, looking at her significantly. âYouâll come
 31366	to the costume tournament, Countess? Do come!â and putting out his
 31367	hand to her bouquet and dropping his voice, he added, âYou will be the
 31368	prettiest there. Do come, dear countess, and give me this flower as a
 31369	pledge!â
 31370	
 31371	    * Are the pretty women.
 31372	
 31373	NatÃ¡sha did not understand what he was saying any more than he did
 31374	himself, but she felt that his incomprehensible words had an improper
 31375	intention. She did not know what to say and turned away as if she had
 31376	not heard his remark. But as soon as she had turned away she felt that
 31377	he was there, behind, so close behind her.
 31378	
 31379	âHow is he now? Confused? Angry? Ought I to put it right?â she
 31380	asked herself, and she could not refrain from turning round. She looked
 31381	straight into his eyes, and his nearness, self-assurance, and the
 31382	good-natured tenderness of his smile vanquished her. She smiled just
 31383	as he was doing, gazing straight into his eyes. And again she felt with
 31384	horror that no barrier lay between him and her.
 31385	
 31386	The curtain rose again. Anatole left the box, serene and gay. NatÃ¡sha
 31387	went back to her father in the other box, now quite submissive to the
 31388	world she found herself in. All that was going on before her now seemed
 31389	quite natural, but on the other hand all her previous thoughts of her
 31390	betrothed, of Princess Mary, or of life in the country did not once
 31391	recur to her mind and were as if belonging to a remote past.
 31392	
 31393	In the fourth act there was some sort of devil who sang waving his arm
 31394	about, till the boards were withdrawn from under him and he disappeared
 31395	down below. That was the only part of the fourth act that NatÃ¡sha saw.
 31396	She felt agitated and tormented, and the cause of this was KurÃ¡gin whom
 31397	she could not help watching. As they were leaving the theater Anatole
 31398	came up to them, called their carriage, and helped them in. As he was
 31399	putting NatÃ¡sha in he pressed her arm above the elbow. Agitated and
 31400	flushed she turned round. He was looking at her with glittering eyes,
 31401	smiling tenderly.
 31402	
 31403	
 31404	Only after she had reached home was NatÃ¡sha able clearly to think over
 31405	what had happened to her, and suddenly remembering Prince Andrew she
 31406	was horrified, and at tea to which all had sat down after the opera, she
 31407	gave a loud exclamation, flushed, and ran out of the room.
 31408	
 31409	âO God! I am lost!â she said to herself. âHow could I let him?â
 31410	She sat for a long time hiding her flushed face in her hands trying to
 31411	realize what had happened to her, but was unable either to understand
 31412	what had happened or what she felt. Everything seemed dark, obscure,
 31413	and terrible. There in that enormous, illuminated theater where the
 31414	bare-legged Duport, in a tinsel-decorated jacket, jumped about to the
 31415	music on wet boards, and young girls and old men, and the nearly
 31416	naked HÃ©lÃ¨ne with her proud, calm smile, rapturously cried
 31417	âbravo!ââthere in the presence of that HÃ©lÃ¨ne it had all seemed
 31418	clear and simple; but now, alone by herself, it was incomprehensible.
 31419	âWhat is it? What was that terror I felt of him? What is this gnawing
 31420	of conscience I am feeling now?â she thought.
 31421	
 31422	Only to the old countess at night in bed could NatÃ¡sha have told all
 31423	she was feeling. She knew that SÃ³nya with her severe and simple views
 31424	would either not understand it at all or would be horrified at such
 31425	a confession. So NatÃ¡sha tried to solve what was torturing her by
 31426	herself.
 31427	
 31428	âAm I spoiled for Andrewâs love or not?â she asked herself, and
 31429	with soothing irony replied: âWhat a fool I am to ask that! What did
 31430	happen to me? Nothing! I have done nothing, I didnât lead him on
 31431	at all. Nobody will know and I shall never see him again,â she told
 31432	herself. âSo it is plain that nothing has happened and there is
 31433	nothing to repent of, and Andrew can love me still. But why âstill?â
 31434	O God, why isnât he here?â NatÃ¡sha quieted herself for a moment,
 31435	but again some instinct told her that though all this was true, and
 31436	though nothing had happened, yet the former purity of her love for
 31437	Prince Andrew had perished. And again in imagination she went over her
 31438	whole conversation with KurÃ¡gin, and again saw the face, gestures, and
 31439	tender smile of that bold handsome man when he pressed her arm.
 31440	
 31441	
 31442	
 31443	
 31444	
 31445	CHAPTER XI
 31446	
 31447	Anatole KurÃ¡gin was staying in Moscow because his father had sent him
 31448	away from Petersburg, where he had been spending twenty thousand rubles
 31449	a year in cash, besides running up debts for as much more, which his
 31450	creditors demanded from his father.
 31451	
 31452	His father announced to him that he would now pay half his debts for the
 31453	last time, but only on condition that he went to Moscow as adjutant to
 31454	the commander in chiefâa post his father had procured for himâand
 31455	would at last try to make a good match there. He indicated to him
 31456	Princess Mary and Julie KarÃ¡gina.
 31457	
 31458	Anatole consented and went to Moscow, where he put up at Pierreâs
 31459	house. Pierre received him unwillingly at first, but got used to him
 31460	after a while, sometimes even accompanied him on his carousals, and gave
 31461	him money under the guise of loans.
 31462	
 31463	As ShinshÃ­n had remarked, from the time of his arrival Anatole had
 31464	turned the heads of the Moscow ladies, especially by the fact that
 31465	he slighted them and plainly preferred the gypsy girls and French
 31466	actressesâwith the chief of whom, Mademoiselle George, he was said to
 31467	be on intimate relations. He had never missed a carousal at DanÃ­lovâs
 31468	or other Moscow revelersâ, drank whole nights through, outvying
 31469	everyone else, and was at all the balls and parties of the best society.
 31470	There was talk of his intrigues with some of the ladies, and he flirted
 31471	with a few of them at the balls. But he did not run after the unmarried
 31472	girls, especially the rich heiresses who were most of them plain.
 31473	There was a special reason for this, as he had got married two years
 31474	beforeâa fact known only to his most intimate friends. At that time
 31475	while with his regiment in Poland, a Polish landowner of small means had
 31476	forced him to marry his daughter. Anatole had very soon abandoned his
 31477	wife and, for a payment which he agreed to send to his father-in-law,
 31478	had arranged to be free to pass himself off as a bachelor.
 31479	
 31480	Anatole was always content with his position, with himself, and with
 31481	others. He was instinctively and thoroughly convinced that it was
 31482	impossible for him to live otherwise than as he did and that he had
 31483	never in his life done anything base. He was incapable of considering
 31484	how his actions might affect others or what the consequences of this or
 31485	that action of his might be. He was convinced that, as a duck is so made
 31486	that it must live in water, so God had made him such that he must spend
 31487	thirty thousand rubles a year and always occupy a prominent position in
 31488	society. He believed this so firmly that others, looking at him, were
 31489	persuaded of it too and did not refuse him either a leading place
 31490	in society or money, which he borrowed from anyone and everyone and
 31491	evidently would not repay.
 31492	
 31493	He was not a gambler, at any rate he did not care about winning. He was
 31494	not vain. He did not mind what people thought of him. Still less could
 31495	he be accused of ambition. More than once he had vexed his father by
 31496	spoiling his own career, and he laughed at distinctions of all kinds. He
 31497	was not mean, and did not refuse anyone who asked of him. All he cared
 31498	about was gaiety and women, and as according to his ideas there
 31499	was nothing dishonorable in these tastes, and he was incapable of
 31500	considering what the gratification of his tastes entailed for others,
 31501	he honestly considered himself irreproachable, sincerely despised rogues
 31502	and bad people, and with a tranquil conscience carried his head high.
 31503	
 31504	Rakes, those male Magdalenes, have a secret feeling of innocence
 31505	similar to that which female Magdalenes have, based on the same hope of
 31506	forgiveness. âAll will be forgiven her, for she loved much; and all
 31507	will be forgiven him, for he enjoyed much.â
 31508	
 31509	DÃ³lokhov, who had reappeared that year in Moscow after his exile and
 31510	his Persian adventures, and was leading a life of luxury, gambling, and
 31511	dissipation, associated with his old Petersburg comrade KurÃ¡gin and
 31512	made use of him for his own ends.
 31513	
 31514	Anatole was sincerely fond of DÃ³lokhov for his cleverness and
 31515	audacity. DÃ³lokhov, who needed Anatole KurÃ¡ginâs name, position, and
 31516	connections as a bait to draw rich young men into his gambling set, made
 31517	use of him and amused himself at his expense without letting the other
 31518	feel it. Apart from the advantage he derived from Anatole, the very
 31519	process of dominating anotherâs will was in itself a pleasure, a
 31520	habit, and a necessity to DÃ³lokhov.
 31521	
 31522	NatÃ¡sha had made a strong impression on KurÃ¡gin. At supper after
 31523	the opera he described to DÃ³lokhov with the air of a connoisseur the
 31524	attractions of her arms, shoulders, feet, and hair and expressed his
 31525	intention of making love to her. Anatole had no notion and was incapable
 31526	of considering what might come of such love-making, as he never had any
 31527	notion of the outcome of any of his actions.
 31528	
 31529	âSheâs first-rate, my dear fellow, but not for us,â replied
 31530	DÃ³lokhov.
 31531	
 31532	âI will tell my sister to ask her to dinner,â said Anatole.
 31533	âEh?â
 31534	
 31535	âYouâd better wait till sheâs married....â
 31536	
 31537	âYou know, I adore little girls, they lose their heads at once,â
 31538	pursued Anatole.
 31539	
 31540	âYou have been caught once already by a âlittle girl,ââ said
 31541	DÃ³lokhov who knew of KurÃ¡ginâs marriage. âTake care!â
 31542	
 31543	âWell, that canât happen twice! Eh?â said Anatole, with a
 31544	good-humored laugh.
 31545	
 31546	
 31547	
 31548	
 31549	
 31550	CHAPTER XII
 31551	
 31552	The day after the opera the RostÃ³vs went nowhere and nobody came to see
 31553	them. MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna talked to the count about something which they
 31554	concealed from NatÃ¡sha. NatÃ¡sha guessed they were talking about the
 31555	old prince and planning something, and this disquieted and offended her.
 31556	She was expecting Prince Andrew any moment and twice that day sent a
 31557	manservant to the VozdvÃ­zhenka to ascertain whether he had come. He had
 31558	not arrived. She suffered more now than during her first days in Moscow.
 31559	To her impatience and pining for him were now added the unpleasant
 31560	recollection of her interview with Princess Mary and the old prince,
 31561	and a fear and anxiety of which she did not understand the cause. She
 31562	continually fancied that either he would never come or that something
 31563	would happen to her before he came. She could no longer think of him by
 31564	herself calmly and continuously as she had done before. As soon as she
 31565	began to think of him, the recollection of the old prince, of Princess
 31566	Mary, of the theater, and of KurÃ¡gin mingled with her thoughts. The
 31567	question again presented itself whether she was not guilty, whether she
 31568	had not already broken faith with Prince Andrew, and again she found
 31569	herself recalling to the minutest detail every word, every gesture, and
 31570	every shade in the play of expression on the face of the man who had
 31571	been able to arouse in her such an incomprehensible and terrifying
 31572	feeling. To the family NatÃ¡sha seemed livelier than usual, but she was
 31573	far less tranquil and happy than before.
 31574	
 31575	On Sunday morning MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna invited her visitors to Mass at her
 31576	parish churchâthe Church of the Assumption built over the graves of
 31577	victims of the plague.
 31578	
 31579	âI donât like those fashionable churches,â she said, evidently
 31580	priding herself on her independence of thought. âGod is the same
 31581	everywhere. We have an excellent priest, he conducts the service
 31582	decently and with dignity, and the deacon is the same. What holiness is
 31583	there in giving concerts in the choir? I donât like it, itâs just
 31584	self-indulgence!â
 31585	
 31586	MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna liked Sundays and knew how to keep them. Her whole
 31587	house was scrubbed and cleaned on Saturdays; neither she nor the
 31588	servants worked, and they all wore holiday dress and went to church. At
 31589	her table there were extra dishes at dinner, and the servants had vodka
 31590	and roast goose or suckling pig. But in nothing in the house was the
 31591	holiday so noticeable as in MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievnaâs broad, stern face,
 31592	which on that day wore an invariable look of solemn festivity.
 31593	
 31594	After Mass, when they had finished their coffee in the dining room
 31595	where the loose covers had been removed from the furniture, a servant
 31596	announced that the carriage was ready, and MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna rose with
 31597	a stern air. She wore her holiday shawl, in which she paid calls, and
 31598	announced that she was going to see Prince Nicholas BolkÃ³nski to have
 31599	an explanation with him about NatÃ¡sha.
 31600	
 31601	After she had gone, a dressmaker from Madame Suppert-Roguet waited on
 31602	the RostÃ³vs, and NatÃ¡sha, very glad of this diversion, having shut
 31603	herself into a room adjoining the drawing room, occupied herself trying
 31604	on the new dresses. Just as she had put on a bodice without sleeves and
 31605	only tacked together, and was turning her head to see in the glass how
 31606	the back fitted, she heard in the drawing room the animated sounds
 31607	of her fatherâs voice and anotherâsâa womanâsâthat made her
 31608	flush. It was HÃ©lÃ¨ne. NatÃ¡sha had not time to take off the bodice
 31609	before the door opened and Countess BezÃºkhova, dressed in a purple
 31610	velvet gown with a high collar, came into the room beaming with
 31611	good-humored amiable smiles.
 31612	
 31613	âOh, my enchantress!â she cried to the blushing NatÃ¡sha.
 31614	âCharming! No, this is really beyond anything, my dear count,â said
 31615	she to Count RostÃ³v who had followed her in. âHow can you live in
 31616	Moscow and go nowhere? No, I wonât let you off! Mademoiselle George
 31617	will recite at my house tonight and thereâll be some people, and if
 31618	you donât bring your lovely girlsâwho are prettier than Mademoiselle
 31619	GeorgeâI wonât know you! My husband is away in Tver or I would send
 31620	him to fetch you. You must come. You positively must! Between eight and
 31621	nine.â
 31622	
 31623	She nodded to the dressmaker, whom she knew and who had curtsied
 31624	respectfully to her, and seated herself in an armchair beside the
 31625	looking glass, draping the folds of her velvet dress picturesquely. She
 31626	did not cease chattering good-naturedly and gaily, continually praising
 31627	NatÃ¡shaâs beauty. She looked at NatÃ¡shaâs dresses and praised
 31628	them, as well as a new dress of her own made of âmetallic gauze,â
 31629	which she had received from Paris, and advised NatÃ¡sha to have one like
 31630	it.
 31631	
 31632	âBut anything suits you, my charmer!â she remarked.
 31633	
 31634	A smile of pleasure never left NatÃ¡shaâs face. She felt happy and as
 31635	if she were blossoming under the praise of this dear Countess BezÃºkhova
 31636	who had formerly seemed to her so unapproachable and important and was
 31637	now so kind to her. NatÃ¡sha brightened up and felt almost in love with
 31638	this woman, who was so beautiful and so kind. HÃ©lÃ¨ne for her part was
 31639	sincerely delighted with NatÃ¡sha and wished to give her a good time.
 31640	Anatole had asked her to bring him and NatÃ¡sha together, and she was
 31641	calling on the RostÃ³vs for that purpose. The idea of throwing her
 31642	brother and NatÃ¡sha together amused her.
 31643	
 31644	Though at one time, in Petersburg, she had been annoyed with NatÃ¡sha
 31645	for drawing BorÃ­s away, she did not think of that now, and in her own
 31646	way heartily wished NatÃ¡sha well. As she was leaving the RostÃ³vs she
 31647	called her protÃ©gÃ©e aside.
 31648	
 31649	âMy brother dined with me yesterdayâwe nearly died of laughterâhe
 31650	ate nothing and kept sighing for you, my charmer! He is madly, quite
 31651	madly, in love with you, my dear.â
 31652	
 31653	NatÃ¡sha blushed scarlet when she heard this.
 31654	
 31655	âHow she blushes, how she blushes, my pretty!â said HÃ©lÃ¨ne. âYou
 31656	must certainly come. If you love somebody, my charmer, that is not a
 31657	reason to shut yourself up. Even if you are engaged, I am sure your
 31658	fiancÃ© would wish you to go into society rather than be bored to
 31659	death.â
 31660	
 31661	âSo she knows I am engaged, and she and her husband Pierreâthat good
 31662	Pierreâhave talked and laughed about this. So itâs all right.â And
 31663	again, under HÃ©lÃ¨neâs influence, what had seemed terrible now seemed
 31664	simple and natural. âAnd she is such a grande dame, so kind, and
 31665	evidently likes me so much. And why not enjoy myself?â thought
 31666	NatÃ¡sha, gazing at HÃ©lÃ¨ne with wide-open, wondering eyes.
 31667	
 31668	MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna came back to dinner taciturn and serious, having
 31669	evidently suffered a defeat at the old princeâs. She was still too
 31670	agitated by the encounter to be able to talk of the affair calmly. In
 31671	answer to the countâs inquiries she replied that things were all
 31672	right and that she would tell about it next day. On hearing of Countess
 31673	BezÃºkhovaâs visit and the invitation for that evening, MÃ¡rya
 31674	DmÃ­trievna remarked:
 31675	
 31676	âI donât care to have anything to do with BezÃºkhova and donât
 31677	advise you to; however, if youâve promisedâgo. It will divert your
 31678	thoughts,â she added, addressing NatÃ¡sha.
 31679	
 31680	
 31681	
 31682	
 31683	
 31684	CHAPTER XIII
 31685	
 31686	Count RostÃ³v took the girls to Countess BezÃºkhovaâs. There were
 31687	a good many people there, but nearly all strangers to NatÃ¡sha. Count
 31688	RostÃ³v was displeased to see that the company consisted almost entirely
 31689	of men and women known for the freedom of their conduct. Mademoiselle
 31690	George was standing in a corner of the drawing room surrounded by young
 31691	men. There were several Frenchmen present, among them MÃ©tivier who from
 31692	the time HÃ©lÃ¨ne reached Moscow had been an intimate in her house. The
 31693	count decided not to sit down to cards or let his girls out of his sight
 31694	and to get away as soon as Mademoiselle Georgeâs performance was over.
 31695	
 31696	Anatole was at the door, evidently on the lookout for the RostÃ³vs.
 31697	Immediately after greeting the count he went up to NatÃ¡sha and followed
 31698	her. As soon as she saw him she was seized by the same feeling she had
 31699	had at the operaâgratified vanity at his admiration of her and fear at
 31700	the absence of a moral barrier between them.
 31701	
 31702	HÃ©lÃ¨ne welcomed NatÃ¡sha delightedly and was loud in admiration of her
 31703	beauty and her dress. Soon after their arrival Mademoiselle George went
 31704	out of the room to change her costume. In the drawing room people began
 31705	arranging the chairs and taking their seats. Anatole moved a chair for
 31706	NatÃ¡sha and was about to sit down beside her, but the count, who never
 31707	lost sight of her, took the seat himself. Anatole sat down behind her.
 31708	
 31709	Mademoiselle George, with her bare, fat, dimpled arms, and a red shawl
 31710	draped over one shoulder, came into the space left vacant for her, and
 31711	assumed an unnatural pose. Enthusiastic whispering was audible.
 31712	
 31713	Mademoiselle George looked sternly and gloomily at the audience and
 31714	began reciting some French verses describing her guilty love for her
 31715	son. In some places she raised her voice, in others she whispered,
 31716	lifting her head triumphantly; sometimes she paused and uttered hoarse
 31717	sounds, rolling her eyes.
 31718	
 31719	âAdorable! divine! delicious!â was heard from every side.
 31720	
 31721	NatÃ¡sha looked at the fat actress, but neither saw nor heard nor
 31722	understood anything of what went on before her. She only felt herself
 31723	again completely borne away into this strange senseless worldâso
 31724	remote from her old worldâa world in which it was impossible to know
 31725	what was good or bad, reasonable or senseless. Behind her sat Anatole,
 31726	and conscious of his proximity she experienced a frightened sense of
 31727	expectancy.
 31728	
 31729	After the first monologue the whole company rose and surrounded
 31730	Mademoiselle George, expressing their enthusiasm.
 31731	
 31732	âHow beautiful she is!â NatÃ¡sha remarked to her father who had also
 31733	risen and was moving through the crowd toward the actress.
 31734	
 31735	âI donât think so when I look at you!â said Anatole, following
 31736	NatÃ¡sha. He said this at a moment when she alone could hear him. âYou
 31737	are enchanting... from the moment I saw you I have never ceased...â
 31738	
 31739	âCome, come, NatÃ¡sha!â said the count, as he turned back for his
 31740	daughter. âHow beautiful she is!â NatÃ¡sha without saying anything
 31741	stepped up to her father and looked at him with surprised inquiring
 31742	eyes.
 31743	
 31744	After giving several recitations, Mademoiselle George left, and Countess
 31745	BezÃºkhova asked her visitors into the ballroom.
 31746	
 31747	The count wished to go home, but HÃ©lÃ¨ne entreated him not to spoil her
 31748	improvised ball, and the RostÃ³vs stayed on. Anatole asked NatÃ¡sha for
 31749	a valse and as they danced he pressed her waist and hand and told her
 31750	she was bewitching and that he loved her. During the Ã©cossaise, which
 31751	she also danced with him, Anatole said nothing when they happened to be
 31752	by themselves, but merely gazed at her. NatÃ¡sha lifted her frightened
 31753	eyes to him, but there was such confident tenderness in his affectionate
 31754	look and smile that she could not, whilst looking at him, say what she
 31755	had to say. She lowered her eyes.
 31756	
 31757	âDonât say such things to me. I am betrothed and love another,â
 31758	she said rapidly.... She glanced at him.
 31759	
 31760	Anatole was not upset or pained by what she had said.
 31761	
 31762	âDonât speak to me of that! What can I do?â said he. âI tell
 31763	you I am madly, madly, in love with you! Is it my fault that you are
 31764	enchanting?... Itâs our turn to begin.â
 31765	
 31766	NatÃ¡sha, animated and excited, looked about her with wide-open
 31767	frightened eyes and seemed merrier than usual. She understood hardly
 31768	anything that went on that evening. They danced the Ã©cossaise and the
 31769	Grossvater. Her father asked her to come home, but she begged to remain.
 31770	Wherever she went and whomever she was speaking to, she felt his eyes
 31771	upon her. Later on she recalled how she had asked her father to let
 31772	her go to the dressing room to rearrange her dress, that HÃ©lÃ¨ne had
 31773	followed her and spoken laughingly of her brotherâs love, and that she
 31774	again met Anatole in the little sitting room. HÃ©lÃ¨ne had disappeared
 31775	leaving them alone, and Anatole had taken her hand and said in a tender
 31776	voice:
 31777	
 31778	âI cannot come to visit you but is it possible that I shall never see
 31779	you? I love you madly. Can I never...?â and, blocking her path, he
 31780	brought his face close to hers.
 31781	
 31782	His large, glittering, masculine eyes were so close to hers that she saw
 31783	nothing but them.
 31784	
 31785	âNatalie?â he whispered inquiringly while she felt her hands being
 31786	painfully pressed. âNatalie?â
 31787	
 31788	âI donât understand. I have nothing to say,â her eyes replied.
 31789	
 31790	Burning lips were pressed to hers, and at the same instant she felt
 31791	herself released, and HÃ©lÃ¨neâs footsteps and the rustle of her dress
 31792	were heard in the room. NatÃ¡sha looked round at her, and then, red
 31793	and trembling, threw a frightened look of inquiry at Anatole and moved
 31794	toward the door.
 31795	
 31796	âOne word, just one, for Godâs sake!â cried Anatole.
 31797	
 31798	She paused. She so wanted a word from him that would explain to her what
 31799	had happened and to which she could find no answer.
 31800	
 31801	âNatalie, just a word, only one!â he kept repeating, evidently not
 31802	knowing what to say and he repeated it till HÃ©lÃ¨ne came up to them.
 31803	
 31804	HÃ©lÃ¨ne returned with NatÃ¡sha to the drawing room. The RostÃ³vs went
 31805	away without staying for supper.
 31806	
 31807	After reaching home NatÃ¡sha did not sleep all night. She was tormented
 31808	by the insoluble question whether she loved Anatole or Prince Andrew.
 31809	She loved Prince Andrewâshe remembered distinctly how deeply she loved
 31810	him. But she also loved Anatole, of that there was no doubt. âElse how
 31811	could all this have happened?â thought she. âIf, after that, I could
 31812	return his smile when saying good-by, if I was able to let it come to
 31813	that, it means that I loved him from the first. It means that he is
 31814	kind, noble, and splendid, and I could not help loving him. What am I to
 31815	do if I love him and the other one too?â she asked herself, unable to
 31816	find an answer to these terrible questions.
 31817	
 31818	
 31819	
 31820	
 31821	
 31822	CHAPTER XIV
 31823	
 31824	Morning came with its cares and bustle. Everyone got up and began
 31825	to move about and talk, dressmakers came again. MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna
 31826	appeared, and they were called to breakfast. NatÃ¡sha kept looking
 31827	uneasily at everybody with wide-open eyes, as if wishing to intercept
 31828	every glance directed toward her, and tried to appear the same as usual.
 31829	
 31830	After breakfast, which was her best time, MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna sat down in
 31831	her armchair and called NatÃ¡sha and the count to her.
 31832	
 31833	âWell, friends, I have now thought the whole matter over and this is
 31834	my advice,â she began. âYesterday, as you know, I went to see Prince
 31835	BolkÃ³nski. Well, I had a talk with him.... He took it into his head to
 31836	begin shouting, but I am not one to be shouted down. I said what I had
 31837	to say!â
 31838	
 31839	âWell, and he?â asked the count.
 31840	
 31841	âHe? Heâs crazy... he did not want to listen. But whatâs the use
 31842	of talking? As it is we have worn the poor girl out,â said MÃ¡rya
 31843	DmÃ­trievna. âMy advice to you is finish your business and go back
 31844	home to OtrÃ¡dnoe... and wait there.â
 31845	
 31846	âOh, no!â exclaimed NatÃ¡sha.
 31847	
 31848	âYes, go back,â said MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna, âand wait there. If your
 31849	betrothed comes here nowâthere will be no avoiding a quarrel; but
 31850	alone with the old man he will talk things over and then come on to
 31851	you.â
 31852	
 31853	Count RostÃ³v approved of this suggestion, appreciating its
 31854	reasonableness. If the old man came round it would be all the better to
 31855	visit him in Moscow or at Bald Hills later on; and if not, the wedding,
 31856	against his wishes, could only be arranged at OtrÃ¡dnoe.
 31857	
 31858	âThat is perfectly true. And I am sorry I went to see him and took
 31859	her,â said the old count.
 31860	
 31861	âNo, why be sorry? Being here, you had to pay your respects. But if he
 31862	wonâtâthatâs his affair,â said MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna, looking for
 31863	something in her reticule. âBesides, the trousseau is ready, so there
 31864	is nothing to wait for; and what is not ready Iâll send after you.
 31865	Though I donât like letting you go, it is the best way. So go, with
 31866	Godâs blessing!â
 31867	
 31868	Having found what she was looking for in the reticule she handed it to
 31869	NatÃ¡sha. It was a letter from Princess Mary.
 31870	
 31871	âShe has written to you. How she torments herself, poor thing! Sheâs
 31872	afraid you might think that she does not like you.â
 31873	
 31874	âBut she doesnât like me,â said NatÃ¡sha.
 31875	
 31876	âDonât talk nonsense!â cried MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna.
 31877	
 31878	âI shanât believe anyone, I know she doesnât like me,â replied
 31879	NatÃ¡sha boldly as she took the letter, and her face expressed a cold
 31880	and angry resolution that caused MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna to look at her more
 31881	intently and to frown.
 31882	
 31883	âDonât answer like that, my good girl!â she said. âWhat I say is
 31884	true! Write an answer!â
 31885	
 31886	NatÃ¡sha did not reply and went to her own room to read Princess
 31887	Maryâs letter.
 31888	
 31889	Princess Mary wrote that she was in despair at the misunderstanding that
 31890	had occurred between them. Whatever her fatherâs feelings might be,
 31891	she begged NatÃ¡sha to believe that she could not help loving her as
 31892	the one chosen by her brother, for whose happiness she was ready to
 31893	sacrifice everything.
 31894	
 31895	âDo not think, however,â she wrote, âthat my father is
 31896	ill-disposed toward you. He is an invalid and an old man who must be
 31897	forgiven; but he is good and magnanimous and will love her who makes his
 31898	son happy.â Princess Mary went on to ask NatÃ¡sha to fix a time when
 31899	she could see her again.
 31900	
 31901	After reading the letter NatÃ¡sha sat down at the writing table
 31902	to answer it. âDear Princess,â she wrote in French quickly and
 31903	mechanically, and then paused. What more could she write after all that
 31904	had happened the evening before? âYes, yes! All that has happened, and
 31905	now all is changed,â she thought as she sat with the letter she had
 31906	begun before her. âMust I break off with him? Must I really? Thatâs
 31907	awful...â and to escape from these dreadful thoughts she went to
 31908	SÃ³nya and began sorting patterns with her.
 31909	
 31910	After dinner NatÃ¡sha went to her room and again took up Princess
 31911	Maryâs letter. âCan it be that it is all over?â she thought.
 31912	âCan it be that all this has happened so quickly and has destroyed all
 31913	that went before?â She recalled her love for Prince Andrew in all its
 31914	former strength, and at the same time felt that she loved KurÃ¡gin. She
 31915	vividly pictured herself as Prince Andrewâs wife, and the scenes of
 31916	happiness with him she had so often repeated in her imagination, and
 31917	at the same time, aglow with excitement, recalled every detail of
 31918	yesterdayâs interview with Anatole.
 31919	
 31920	âWhy could that not be as well?â she sometimes asked herself in
 31921	complete bewilderment. âOnly so could I be completely happy; but now I
 31922	have to choose, and I canât be happy without either of them. Only,â
 31923	she thought, âto tell Prince Andrew what has happened or to hide
 31924	it from him are both equally impossible. But with that one nothing is
 31925	spoiled. But am I really to abandon forever the joy of Prince Andrewâs
 31926	love, in which I have lived so long?â
 31927	
 31928	âPlease, Miss!â whispered a maid entering the room with a mysterious
 31929	air. âA man told me to give you thisââ and she handed NatÃ¡sha a
 31930	letter.
 31931	
 31932	âOnly, for Christâs sake...â the girl went on, as NatÃ¡sha,
 31933	without thinking, mechanically broke the seal and read a love letter
 31934	from Anatole, of which, without taking in a word, she understood only
 31935	that it was a letter from himâfrom the man she loved. Yes, she loved
 31936	him, or else how could that have happened which had happened? And how
 31937	could she have a love letter from him in her hand?
 31938	
 31939	With trembling hands NatÃ¡sha held that passionate love letter which
 31940	DÃ³lokhov had composed for Anatole, and as she read it she found in it
 31941	an echo of all that she herself imagined she was feeling.
 31942	
 31943	âSince yesterday evening my fate has been sealed; to be loved by you
 31944	or to die. There is no other way for me,â the letter began. Then he
 31945	went on to say that he knew her parents would not give her to himâfor
 31946	this there were secret reasons he could reveal only to herâbut that if
 31947	she loved him she need only say the word yes, and no human power could
 31948	hinder their bliss. Love would conquer all. He would steal her away and
 31949	carry her off to the ends of the earth.
 31950	
 31951	âYes, yes! I love him!â thought NatÃ¡sha, reading the letter for the
 31952	twentieth time and finding some peculiarly deep meaning in each word of
 31953	it.
 31954	
 31955	That evening MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna was going to the AkhÃ¡rovsâ and
 31956	proposed to take the girls with her. NatÃ¡sha, pleading a headache,
 31957	remained at home.

 31963	CHAPTER XV
 31964	
 31965	On returning late in the evening SÃ³nya went to NatÃ¡shaâs room, and
 31966	to her surprise found her still dressed and asleep on the sofa. Open on
 31967	the table, beside her lay Anatoleâs letter. SÃ³nya picked it up and
 31968	read it.
 31969	
 31970	As she read she glanced at the sleeping NatÃ¡sha, trying to find in her
 31971	face an explanation of what she was reading, but did not find it. Her
 31972	face was calm, gentle, and happy. Clutching her breast to keep herself
 31973	from choking, SÃ³nya, pale and trembling with fear and agitation, sat
 31974	down in an armchair and burst into tears.
 31975	
 31976	âHow was it I noticed nothing? How could it go so far? Can she have
 31977	left off loving Prince Andrew? And how could she let KurÃ¡gin go to
 31978	such lengths? He is a deceiver and a villain, thatâs plain! What will
 31979	Nicholas, dear noble Nicholas, do when he hears of it? So this is
 31980	the meaning of her excited, resolute, unnatural look the day before
 31981	yesterday, yesterday, and today,â thought SÃ³nya. âBut it canât be
 31982	that she loves him! She probably opened the letter without knowing who
 31983	it was from. Probably she is offended by it. She could not do such a
 31984	thing!â
 31985	
 31986	SÃ³nya wiped away her tears and went up to NatÃ¡sha, again scanning her
 31987	face.
 31988	
 31989	âNatÃ¡sha!â she said, just audibly.
 31990	
 31991	NatÃ¡sha awoke and saw SÃ³nya.
 31992	
 31993	âAh, youâre back?â
 31994	
 31995	And with the decision and tenderness that often come at the moment of
 31996	awakening, she embraced her friend, but noticing SÃ³nyaâs look of
 31997	embarrassment, her own face expressed confusion and suspicion.
 31998	
 31999	âSÃ³nya, youâve read that letter?â she demanded.
 32000	
 32001	âYes,â answered SÃ³nya softly.
 32002	
 32003	NatÃ¡sha smiled rapturously.
 32004	
 32005	âNo, SÃ³nya, I canât any longer!â she said. âI canât hide it
 32006	from you any longer. You know, we love one another! SÃ³nya, darling, he
 32007	writes... SÃ³nya...â
 32008	
 32009	SÃ³nya stared open-eyed at NatÃ¡sha, unable to believe her ears.
 32010	
 32011	âAnd BolkÃ³nski?â she asked.
 32012	
 32013	âAh, SÃ³nya, if you only knew how happy I am!â cried NatÃ¡sha.
 32014	âYou donât know what love is....â
 32015	
 32016	âBut, NatÃ¡sha, can that be all over?â
 32017	
 32018	NatÃ¡sha looked at SÃ³nya with wide-open eyes as if she could not grasp
 32019	the question.
 32020	
 32021	âWell, then, are you refusing Prince Andrew?â said SÃ³nya.
 32022	
 32023	âOh, you donât understand anything! Donât talk nonsense, just
 32024	listen!â said NatÃ¡sha, with momentary vexation.
 32025	
 32026	âBut I canât believe it,â insisted SÃ³nya. âI donât
 32027	understand. How is it you have loved a man for a whole year and
 32028	suddenly... Why, you have only seen him three times! NatÃ¡sha, I donât
 32029	believe you, youâre joking! In three days to forget everything and
 32030	so...â
 32031	
 32032	âThree days?â said NatÃ¡sha. âIt seems to me Iâve loved him a
 32033	hundred years. It seems to me that I have never loved anyone before. You
 32034	canât understand it.... SÃ³nya, wait a bit, sit here,â and NatÃ¡sha
 32035	embraced and kissed her.
 32036	
 32037	âI had heard that it happens like this, and you must have heard it
 32038	too, but itâs only now that I feel such love. Itâs not the same as
 32039	before. As soon as I saw him I felt he was my master and I his slave,
 32040	and that I could not help loving him. Yes, his slave! Whatever he orders
 32041	I shall do. You donât understand that. What can I do? What can I do,
 32042	SÃ³nya?â cried NatÃ¡sha with a happy yet frightened expression.
 32043	
 32044	âBut think what you are doing,â cried SÃ³nya. âI canât leave
 32045	it like this. This secret correspondence... How could you let him go so
 32046	far?â she went on, with a horror and disgust she could hardly conceal.
 32047	
 32048	âI told you that I have no will,â NatÃ¡sha replied. âWhy canât
 32049	you understand? I love him!â
 32050	
 32051	âThen I wonât let it come to that... I shall tell!â cried SÃ³nya,
 32052	bursting into tears.
 32053	
 32054	âWhat do you mean? For Godâs sake... If you tell, you are my
 32055	enemy!â declared NatÃ¡sha. âYou want me to be miserable, you want us
 32056	to be separated....â
 32057	
 32058	When she saw NatÃ¡shaâs fright, SÃ³nya shed tears of shame and pity
 32059	for her friend.
 32060	
 32061	âBut what has happened between you?â she asked. âWhat has he said
 32062	to you? Why doesnât he come to the house?â
 32063	
 32064	NatÃ¡sha did not answer her questions.
 32065	
 32066	âFor Godâs sake, SÃ³nya, donât tell anyone, donât torture
 32067	me,â NatÃ¡sha entreated. âRemember no one ought to interfere in such
 32068	matters! I have confided in you....â
 32069	
 32070	âBut why this secrecy? Why doesnât he come to the house?â asked
 32071	SÃ³nya. âWhy doesnât he openly ask for your hand? You know Prince
 32072	Andrew gave you complete freedomâif it is really so; but I donât
 32073	believe it! NatÃ¡sha, have you considered what these secret reasons can
 32074	be?â
 32075	
 32076	NatÃ¡sha looked at SÃ³nya with astonishment. Evidently this question
 32077	presented itself to her mind for the first time and she did not know how
 32078	to answer it.
 32079	
 32080	âI donât know what the reasons are. But there must be reasons!â
 32081	
 32082	SÃ³nya sighed and shook her head incredulously.
 32083	
 32084	âIf there were reasons...â she began.
 32085	
 32086	But NatÃ¡sha, guessing her doubts, interrupted her in alarm.
 32087	
 32088	âSÃ³nya, one canât doubt him! One canât, one canât! Donât you
 32089	understand?â she cried.
 32090	
 32091	âDoes he love you?â
 32092	
 32093	âDoes he love me?â NatÃ¡sha repeated with a smile of pity at her
 32094	friendâs lack of comprehension. âWhy, you have read his letter and
 32095	you have seen him.â
 32096	
 32097	âBut if he is dishonorable?â
 32098	
 32099	âHe! dishonorable? If you only knew!â exclaimed NatÃ¡sha.
 32100	
 32101	âIf he is an honorable man he should either declare his intentions or
 32102	cease seeing you; and if you wonât do this, I will. I will write to
 32103	him, and I will tell Papa!â said SÃ³nya resolutely.
 32104	
 32105	âBut I canât live without him!â cried NatÃ¡sha.
 32106	
 32107	âNatÃ¡sha, I donât understand you. And what are you saying! Think of
 32108	your father and of Nicholas.â
 32109	
 32110	âI donât want anyone, I donât love anyone but him. How dare you
 32111	say he is dishonorable? Donât you know that I love him?â screamed
 32112	NatÃ¡sha. âGo away, SÃ³nya! I donât want to quarrel with you, but
 32113	go, for Godâs sake go! You see how I am suffering!â NatÃ¡sha cried
 32114	angrily, in a voice of despair and repressed irritation. SÃ³nya burst
 32115	into sobs and ran from the room.
 32116	
 32117	NatÃ¡sha went to the table and without a momentâs reflection wrote
 32118	that answer to Princess Mary which she had been unable to write all
 32119	the morning. In this letter she said briefly that all their
 32120	misunderstandings were at an end; that availing herself of the
 32121	magnanimity of Prince Andrew who when he went abroad had given her her
 32122	freedom, she begged Princess Mary to forget everything and forgive her
 32123	if she had been to blame toward her, but that she could not be his
 32124	wife. At that moment this all seemed quite easy, simple, and clear to
 32125	NatÃ¡sha.
 32126	
 32127	
 32128	On Friday the RostÃ³vs were to return to the country, but on Wednesday
 32129	the count went with the prospective purchaser to his estate near Moscow.
 32130	
 32131	On the day the count left, SÃ³nya and NatÃ¡sha were invited to a big
 32132	dinner party at the KarÃ¡ginsâ, and MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna took them
 32133	there. At that party NatÃ¡sha again met Anatole, and SÃ³nya noticed
 32134	that she spoke to him, trying not to be overheard, and that all through
 32135	dinner she was more agitated than ever. When they got home NatÃ¡sha was
 32136	the first to begin the explanation SÃ³nya expected.
 32137	
 32138	âThere, SÃ³nya, you were talking all sorts of nonsense about him,â
 32139	NatÃ¡sha began in a mild voice such as children use when they wish to be
 32140	praised. âWe have had an explanation today.â
 32141	
 32142	âWell, what happened? What did he say? NatÃ¡sha, how glad I am
 32143	youâre not angry with me! Tell me everythingâthe whole truth. What
 32144	did he say?â
 32145	
 32146	NatÃ¡sha became thoughtful.
 32147	
 32148	âOh, SÃ³nya, if you knew him as I do! He said... He asked me what I
 32149	had promised BolkÃ³nski. He was glad I was free to refuse him.â
 32150	
 32151	SÃ³nya sighed sorrowfully.
 32152	
 32153	âBut you havenât refused BolkÃ³nski?â said she.
 32154	
 32155	âPerhaps I have. Perhaps all is over between me and BolkÃ³nski. Why do
 32156	you think so badly of me?â
 32157	
 32158	âI donât think anything, only I donât understand this...â
 32159	
 32160	âWait a bit, SÃ³nya, youâll understand everything. Youâll see what
 32161	a man he is! Now donât think badly of me or of him. I donât think
 32162	badly of anyone: I love and pity everybody. But what am I to do?â
 32163	
 32164	SÃ³nya did not succumb to the tender tone NatÃ¡sha used toward her.
 32165	The more emotional and ingratiating the expression of NatÃ¡shaâs face
 32166	became, the more serious and stern grew SÃ³nyaâs.
 32167	
 32168	âNatÃ¡sha,â said she, âyou asked me not to speak to you, and I
 32169	havenât spoken, but now you yourself have begun. I donât trust him,
 32170	NatÃ¡sha. Why this secrecy?â
 32171	
 32172	âAgain, again!â interrupted NatÃ¡sha.
 32173	
 32174	âNatÃ¡sha, I am afraid for you!â
 32175	
 32176	âAfraid of what?â
 32177	
 32178	âI am afraid youâre going to your ruin,â said SÃ³nya resolutely,
 32179	and was herself horrified at what she had said.
 32180	
 32181	Anger again showed in NatÃ¡shaâs face.
 32182	
 32183	âAnd Iâll go to my ruin, I will, as soon as possible! Itâs not
 32184	your business! It wonât be you, but I, whoâll suffer. Leave me
 32185	alone, leave me alone! I hate you!â
 32186	
 32187	âNatÃ¡sha!â moaned SÃ³nya, aghast.
 32188	
 32189	âI hate you, I hate you! Youâre my enemy forever!â And NatÃ¡sha
 32190	ran out of the room.
 32191	
 32192	NatÃ¡sha did not speak to SÃ³nya again and avoided her. With the same
 32193	expression of agitated surprise and guilt she went about the house,
 32194	taking up now one occupation, now another, and at once abandoning them.
 32195	
 32196	Hard as it was for SÃ³nya, she watched her friend and did not let her
 32197	out of her sight.
 32198	
 32199	The day before the count was to return, SÃ³nya noticed that NatÃ¡sha sat
 32200	by the drawing room window all the morning as if expecting something and
 32201	that she made a sign to an officer who drove past, whom SÃ³nya took to
 32202	be Anatole.
 32203	
 32204	SÃ³nya began watching her friend still more attentively and noticed that
 32205	at dinner and all that evening NatÃ¡sha was in a strange and unnatural
 32206	state. She answered questions at random, began sentences she did not
 32207	finish, and laughed at everything.
 32208	
 32209	After tea SÃ³nya noticed a housemaid at NatÃ¡shaâs door timidly
 32210	waiting to let her pass. She let the girl go in, and then listening at
 32211	the door learned that another letter had been delivered.
 32212	
 32213	Then suddenly it became clear to SÃ³nya that NatÃ¡sha had some dreadful
 32214	plan for that evening. SÃ³nya knocked at her door. NatÃ¡sha did not let
 32215	her in.
 32216	
 32217	âShe will run away with him!â thought SÃ³nya. âShe is capable of
 32218	anything. There was something particularly pathetic and resolute in
 32219	her face today. She cried as she said good-by to Uncle,â SÃ³nya
 32220	remembered. âYes, thatâs it, she means to elope with him, but
 32221	what am I to do?â thought she, recalling all the signs that clearly
 32222	indicated that NatÃ¡sha had some terrible intention. âThe count is
 32223	away. What am I to do? Write to KurÃ¡gin demanding an explanation? But
 32224	what is there to oblige him to reply? Write to Pierre, as Prince Andrew
 32225	asked me to in case of some misfortune?... But perhaps she really
 32226	has already refused BolkÃ³nskiâshe sent a letter to Princess Mary
 32227	yesterday. And Uncle is away....â To tell MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna who had
 32228	such faith in NatÃ¡sha seemed to SÃ³nya terrible. âWell, anyway,â
 32229	thought SÃ³nya as she stood in the dark passage, ânow or never I must
 32230	prove that I remember the familyâs goodness to me and that I love
 32231	Nicholas. Yes! If I donât sleep for three nights Iâll not leave this
 32232	passage and will hold her back by force and will and not let the family
 32233	be disgraced,â thought she.
 32234	
 32235	
 32236	
 32237	
 32238	
 32239	CHAPTER XVI
 32240	
 32241	Anatole had lately moved to DÃ³lokhovâs. The plan for Natalie
 32242	RostÃ³vaâs abduction had been arranged and the preparations made by
 32243	DÃ³lokhov a few days before, and on the day that SÃ³nya, after listening
 32244	at NatÃ¡shaâs door, resolved to safeguard her, it was to have been
 32245	put into execution. NatÃ¡sha had promised to come out to KurÃ¡gin at the
 32246	back porch at ten that evening. KurÃ¡gin was to put her into a troyka
 32247	he would have ready and to drive her forty miles to the village of
 32248	KÃ¡menka, where an unfrocked priest was in readiness to perform a
 32249	marriage ceremony over them. At KÃ¡menka a relay of horses was to wait
 32250	which would take them to the Warsaw highroad, and from there they would
 32251	hasten abroad with post horses.
 32252	
 32253	Anatole had a passport, an order for post horses, ten thousand rubles
 32254	he had taken from his sister and another ten thousand borrowed with
 32255	DÃ³lokhovâs help.
 32256	
 32257	Two witnesses for the mock marriageâKhvÃ³stikov, a retired petty
 32258	official whom DÃ³lokhov made use of in his gambling transactions, and
 32259	MakÃ¡rin, a retired hussar, a kindly, weak fellow who had an unbounded
 32260	affection for KurÃ¡ginâwere sitting at tea in DÃ³lokhovâs front
 32261	room.
 32262	
 32263	In his large study, the walls of which were hung to the ceiling with
 32264	Persian rugs, bearskins, and weapons, sat DÃ³lokhov in a traveling cloak
 32265	and high boots, at an open desk on which lay an abacus and some bundles
 32266	of paper money. Anatole, with uniform unbuttoned, walked to and fro from
 32267	the room where the witnesses were sitting, through the study to the room
 32268	behind, where his French valet and others were packing the last of his
 32269	things. DÃ³lokhov was counting the money and noting something down.
 32270	
 32271	âWell,â he said, âKhvÃ³stikov must have two thousand.â
 32272	
 32273	âGive it to him, then,â said Anatole.
 32274	
 32275	âMakÃ¡rkaâ (their name for MakÃ¡rin) âwill go through fire and
 32276	water for you for nothing. So here are our accounts all settled,â said
 32277	DÃ³lokhov, showing him the memorandum. âIs that right?â
 32278	
 32279	âYes, of course,â returned Anatole, evidently not listening to
 32280	DÃ³lokhov and looking straight before him with a smile that did not
 32281	leave his face.
 32282	
 32283	DÃ³lokhov banged down the lid of his desk and turned to Anatole with an
 32284	ironic smile:
 32285	
 32286	âDo you know? Youâd really better drop it all. Thereâs still
 32287	time!â
 32288	
 32289	âFool,â retorted Anatole. âDonât talk nonsense! If you only
 32290	knew... itâs the devil knows what!â
 32291	
 32292	âNo, really, give it up!â said DÃ³lokhov. âI am speaking
 32293	seriously. Itâs no joke, this plot youâve hatched.â
 32294	
 32295	âWhat, teasing again? Go to the devil! Eh?â said Anatole, making a
 32296	grimace. âReally itâs no time for your stupid jokes,â and he left
 32297	the room.
 32298	
 32299	DÃ³lokhov smiled contemptuously and condescendingly when Anatole had
 32300	gone out.
 32301	
 32302	âYou wait a bit,â he called after him. âIâm not joking, Iâm
 32303	talking sense. Come here, come here!â
 32304	
 32305	Anatole returned and looked at DÃ³lokhov, trying to give him his
 32306	attention and evidently submitting to him involuntarily.
 32307	
 32308	âNow listen to me. Iâm telling you this for the last time. Why
 32309	should I joke about it? Did I hinder you? Who arranged everything for
 32310	you? Who found the priest and got the passport? Who raised the money? I
 32311	did it all.â
 32312	
 32313	âWell, thank you for it. Do you think I am not grateful?â And
 32314	Anatole sighed and embraced DÃ³lokhov.
 32315	
 32316	âI helped you, but all the same I must tell you the truth; it is a
 32317	dangerous business, and if you think about itâa stupid business. Well,
 32318	youâll carry her offâall right! Will they let it stop at that? It
 32319	will come out that youâre already married. Why, theyâll have you in
 32320	the criminal court....â
 32321	
 32322	âOh, nonsense, nonsense!â Anatole ejaculated and again made a
 32323	grimace. âDidnât I explain to you? What?â And Anatole, with the
 32324	partiality dull-witted people have for any conclusion they have reached
 32325	by their own reasoning, repeated the argument he had already put to
 32326	DÃ³lokhov a hundred times. âDidnât I explain to you that I have come
 32327	to this conclusion: if this marriage is invalid,â he went on, crooking
 32328	one finger, âthen I have nothing to answer for; but if it is valid, no
 32329	matter! Abroad no one will know anything about it. Isnât that so? And
 32330	donât talk to me, donât, donât.â
 32331	
 32332	âSeriously, youâd better drop it! Youâll only get yourself into a
 32333	mess!â
 32334	
 32335	âGo to the devil!â cried Anatole and, clutching his hair, left the
 32336	room, but returned at once and dropped into an armchair in front of
 32337	DÃ³lokhov with his feet turned under him. âItâs the very devil!
 32338	What? Feel how it beats!â He took DÃ³lokhovâs hand and put it on his
 32339	heart. âWhat a foot, my dear fellow! What a glance! A goddess!â he
 32340	added in French. âWhat?â
 32341	
 32342	DÃ³lokhov with a cold smile and a gleam in his handsome insolent eyes
 32343	looked at himâevidently wishing to get some more amusement out of him.
 32344	
 32345	âWell and when the moneyâs gone, what then?â
 32346	
 32347	âWhat then? Eh?â repeated Anatole, sincerely perplexed by a thought
 32348	of the future. âWhat then?... Then, I donât know.... But why talk
 32349	nonsense!â He glanced at his watch. âItâs time!â
 32350	
 32351	Anatole went into the back room.
 32352	
 32353	âNow then! Nearly ready? Youâre dawdling!â he shouted to the
 32354	servants.
 32355	
 32356	DÃ³lokhov put away the money, called a footman whom he ordered to bring
 32357	something for them to eat and drink before the journey, and went into
 32358	the room where KhvÃ³stikov and MakÃ¡rin were sitting.
 32359	
 32360	Anatole lay on the sofa in the study leaning on his elbow and smiling
 32361	pensively, while his handsome lips muttered tenderly to himself.
 32362	
 32363	âCome and eat something. Have a drink!â DÃ³lokhov shouted to him
 32364	from the other room.
 32365	
 32366	âI donât want to,â answered Anatole continuing to smile.
 32367	
 32368	âCome! BalagÃ¡ is here.â
 32369	
 32370	Anatole rose and went into the dining room. BalagÃ¡ was a famous troyka
 32371	driver who had known DÃ³lokhov and Anatole some six years and had given
 32372	them good service with his troykas. More than once when Anatoleâs
 32373	regiment was stationed at Tver he had taken him from Tver in the
 32374	evening, brought him to Moscow by daybreak, and driven him back again
 32375	the next night. More than once he had enabled DÃ³lokhov to escape when
 32376	pursued. More than once he had driven them through the town with gypsies
 32377	and âladykinsâ as he called the cocottes. More than once in their
 32378	service he had run over pedestrians and upset vehicles in the streets
 32379	of Moscow and had always been protected from the consequences by âmy
 32380	gentlemenâ as he called them. He had ruined more than one horse in
 32381	their service. More than once they had beaten him, and more than once
 32382	they had made him drunk on champagne and Madeira, which he loved; and
 32383	he knew more than one thing about each of them which would long ago have
 32384	sent an ordinary man to Siberia. They often called BalagÃ¡ into their
 32385	orgies and made him drink and dance at the gypsiesâ, and more than one
 32386	thousand rubles of their money had passed through his hands. In their
 32387	service he risked his skin and his life twenty times a year, and in
 32388	their service had lost more horses than the money he had from them would
 32389	buy. But he liked them; liked that mad driving at twelve miles an hour,
 32390	liked upsetting a driver or running down a pedestrian, and flying at
 32391	full gallop through the Moscow streets. He liked to hear those wild,
 32392	tipsy shouts behind him: âGet on! Get on!â when it was impossible
 32393	to go any faster. He liked giving a painful lash on the neck to some
 32394	peasant who, more dead than alive, was already hurrying out of his way.
 32395	âReal gentlemen!â he considered them.
 32396	
 32397	Anatole and DÃ³lokhov liked BalagÃ¡ too for his masterly driving and
 32398	because he liked the things they liked. With others BalagÃ¡ bargained,
 32399	charging twenty-five rubles for a two hoursâ drive, and rarely
 32400	drove himself, generally letting his young men do so. But with âhis
 32401	gentlemenâ he always drove himself and never demanded anything for
 32402	his work. Only a couple of times a yearâwhen he knew from their valets
 32403	that they had money in handâhe would turn up of a morning quite sober
 32404	and with a deep bow would ask them to help him. The gentlemen always
 32405	made him sit down.
 32406	
 32407	âDo help me out, Theodore IvÃ¡nych, sir,â or âyour excellency,â
 32408	he would say. âI am quite out of horses. Let me have what you can to
 32409	go to the fair.â
 32410	
 32411	And Anatole and DÃ³lokhov, when they had money, would give him a
 32412	thousand or a couple of thousand rubles.
 32413	
 32414	BalagÃ¡ was a fair-haired, short, and snub-nosed peasant of about
 32415	twenty-seven; red-faced, with a particularly red thick neck, glittering
 32416	little eyes, and a small beard. He wore a fine, dark-blue, silk-lined
 32417	cloth coat over a sheepskin.
 32418	
 32419	On entering the room now he crossed himself, turning toward the front
 32420	corner of the room, and went up to DÃ³lokhov, holding out a small, black
 32421	hand.
 32422	
 32423	âTheodore IvÃ¡nych!â he said, bowing.
 32424	
 32425	âHow dâyou do, friend? Well, here he is!â
 32426	
 32427	âGood day, your excellency!â he said, again holding out his hand to
 32428	Anatole who had just come in.
 32429	
 32430	âI say, BalagÃ¡,â said Anatole, putting his hands on the manâs
 32431	shoulders, âdo you care for me or not? Eh? Now, do me a service....
 32432	What horses have you come with? Eh?â
 32433	
 32434	âAs your messenger ordered, your special beasts,â replied BalagÃ¡.
 32435	
 32436	âWell, listen, BalagÃ¡! Drive all three to death but get me there in
 32437	three hours. Eh?â
 32438	
 32439	âWhen they are dead, what shall I drive?â said BalagÃ¡ with a wink.
 32440	
 32441	âMind, Iâll smash your face in! Donât make jokes!â cried
 32442	Anatole, suddenly rolling his eyes.
 32443	
 32444	âWhy joke?â said the driver, laughing. âAs if Iâd grudge my
 32445	gentlemen anything! As fast as ever the horses can gallop, so fast
 32446	weâll go!â
 32447	
 32448	âAh!â said Anatole. âWell, sit down.â
 32449	
 32450	âYes, sit down!â said DÃ³lokhov.
 32451	
 32452	âIâll stand, Theodore IvÃ¡nych.â
 32453	
 32454	âSit down; nonsense! Have a drink!â said Anatole, and filled a large
 32455	glass of Madeira for him.
 32456	
 32457	The driverâs eyes sparkled at the sight of the wine. After refusing
 32458	it for mannersâ sake, he drank it and wiped his mouth with a red silk
 32459	handkerchief he took out of his cap.
 32460	
 32461	âAnd when are we to start, your excellency?â
 32462	
 32463	âWell...â Anatole looked at his watch. âWeâll start at once.
 32464	Mind, BalagÃ¡! Youâll get there in time? Eh?â
 32465	
 32466	âThat depends on our luck in starting, else why shouldnât we be
 32467	there in time?â replied BalagÃ¡. âDidnât we get you to Tver in
 32468	seven hours? I think you remember that, your excellency?â
 32469	
 32470	âDo you know, one Christmas I drove from Tver,â said Anatole,
 32471	smilingly at the recollection and turning to MakÃ¡rin who gazed
 32472	rapturously at him with wide-open eyes. âWill you believe it,
 32473	MakÃ¡rka, it took oneâs breath away, the rate we flew. We came across
 32474	a train of loaded sleighs and drove right over two of them. Eh?â
 32475	
 32476	âThose were horses!â BalagÃ¡ continued the tale. âThat time Iâd
 32477	harnessed two young side horses with the bay in the shafts,â he went
 32478	on, turning to DÃ³lokhov. âWill you believe it, Theodore IvÃ¡nych,
 32479	those animals flew forty miles? I couldnât hold them in, my hands grew
 32480	numb in the sharp frost so that I threw down the reinsââCatch hold
 32481	yourself, your excellency!â says I, and I just tumbled on the bottom
 32482	of the sleigh and sprawled there. It wasnât a case of urging them on,
 32483	there was no holding them in till we reached the place. The devils took
 32484	us there in three hours! Only the near one died of it.â
 32485	
 32486	
 32487	
 32488	
 32489	
 32490	CHAPTER XVII
 32491	
 32492	Anatole went out of the room and returned a few minutes later wearing
 32493	a fur coat girt with a silver belt, and a sable cap jauntily set on one
 32494	side and very becoming to his handsome face. Having looked in a mirror,
 32495	and standing before DÃ³lokhov in the same pose he had assumed before it,
 32496	he lifted a glass of wine.
 32497	
 32498	âWell, good-by, Theodore. Thank you for everything and farewell!â said
 32499	Anatole. âWell, comrades and friends...â he considered for a moment â...
 32500	of my youth, farewell!â he said, turning to MakÃ¡rin and the others.
 32501	
 32502	Though they were all going with him, Anatole evidently wished to make
 32503	something touching and solemn out of this address to his comrades. He
 32504	spoke slowly in a loud voice and throwing out his chest slightly swayed
 32505	one leg.
 32506	
 32507	âAll take glasses; you too, BalagÃ¡. Well, comrades and friends of my
 32508	youth, weâve had our fling and lived and reveled. Eh? And now, when
 32509	shall we meet again? I am going abroad. We have had a good timeânow
 32510	farewell, lads! To our health! Hurrah!...â he cried, and emptying his
 32511	glass flung it on the floor.
 32512	
 32513	âTo your health!â said BalagÃ¡ who also emptied his glass, and wiped his
 32514	mouth with his handkerchief.
 32515	
 32516	MakÃ¡rin embraced Anatole with tears in his eyes.
 32517	
 32518	âAh, Prince, how sorry I am to part from you!
 32519	
 32520	âLetâs go. Letâs go!â cried Anatole.
 32521	
 32522	BalagÃ¡ was about to leave the room.
 32523	
 32524	âNo, stop!â said Anatole. âShut the door; we have first to sit down.
 32525	Thatâs the way.â
 32526	
 32527	They shut the door and all sat down.
 32528	
 32529	âNow, quick march, lads!â said Anatole, rising.
 32530	
 32531	Joseph, his valet, handed him his sabretache and saber, and they all
 32532	went out into the vestibule.
 32533	
 32534	âAnd whereâs the fur cloak?â asked DÃ³lokhov. âHey, IgnÃ¡tka! Go to
 32535	MatrÃ«na MatrÃ©vna and ask her for the sable cloak. I have heard what
 32536	elopements are like,â continued DÃ³lokhov with a wink. âWhy, sheâll rush
 32537	out more dead than alive just in the things she is wearing; if you delay
 32538	at all thereâll be tears and âPapaâ and âMamma,â and sheâs frozen in a
 32539	minute and must go backâbut you wrap the fur cloak round her first thing
 32540	and carry her to the sleigh.â
 32541	
 32542	The valet brought a womanâs fox-lined cloak.
 32543	
 32544	âFool, I told you the sable one! Hey, MatrÃ«na, the sable!â he shouted so
 32545	that his voice rang far through the rooms.
 32546	
 32547	A handsome, slim, and pale-faced gypsy girl with glittering black eyes
 32548	and curly blue-black hair, wearing a red shawl, ran out with a sable
 32549	mantle on her arm.
 32550	
 32551	âHere, I donât grudge itâtake it!â she said, evidently afraid of her
 32552	master and yet regretful of her cloak.
 32553	
 32554	DÃ³lokhov, without answering, took the cloak, threw it over MatrÃ«na, and
 32555	wrapped her up in it.
 32556	
 32557	âThatâs the way,â said DÃ³lokhov, âand then so!â and he turned the collar
 32558	up round her head, leaving only a little of the face uncovered. âAnd
 32559	then so, do you see?â and he pushed Anatoleâs head forward to meet the
 32560	gap left by the collar, through which MatrÃ«naâs brilliant smile was
 32561	seen.
 32562	
 32563	âWell, good-by, MatrÃ«na,â said Anatole, kissing her. âAh, my revels here
 32564	are over. Remember me to StÃ«shka. There, good-by! Good-by, MatrÃ«na, wish
 32565	me luck!â
 32566	
 32567	âWell, Prince, may God give you great luck!â said MatrÃ«na in her gypsy
 32568	accent.
 32569	
 32570	Two troykas were standing before the porch and two young drivers were
 32571	holding the horses. BalagÃ¡ took his seat in the front one and holding
 32572	his elbows high arranged the reins deliberately. Anatole and DÃ³lokhov
 32573	got in with him. MakÃ¡rin, KhvÃ³stikov, and a valet seated themselves in
 32574	the other sleigh.
 32575	
 32576	âWell, are you ready?â asked BalagÃ¡.
 32577	
 32578	âGo!â he cried, twisting the reins round his hands, and the troyka tore
 32579	down the NikÃ­tski Boulevard.
 32580	
 32581	âTproo! Get out of the way! Hi!... Tproo!...â The shouting of BalagÃ¡
 32582	and of the sturdy young fellow seated on the box was all that could
 32583	be heard. On the ArbÃ¡t Square the troyka caught against a carriage;
 32584	something cracked, shouts were heard, and the troyka flew along the
 32585	ArbÃ¡t Street.
 32586	
 32587	After taking a turn along the PodnovÃ­nski Boulevard, BalagÃ¡ began to
 32588	rein in, and turning back drew up at the crossing of the old KonyÃºsheny
 32589	Street.
 32590	
 32591	The young fellow on the box jumped down to hold the horses and Anatole
 32592	and DÃ³lokhov went along the pavement. When they reached the gate
 32593	DÃ³lokhov whistled. The whistle was answered, and a maidservant ran out.
 32594	
 32595	âCome into the courtyard or youâll be seen; sheâll come out directly,â
 32596	said she.
 32597	
 32598	DÃ³lokhov stayed by the gate. Anatole followed the maid into the
 32599	courtyard, turned the corner, and ran up into the porch.
 32600	
 32601	He was met by Gabriel, MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievnaâs gigantic footman.
 32602	
 32603	âCome to the mistress, please,â said the footman in his deep bass,
 32604	intercepting any retreat.
 32605	
 32606	âTo what Mistress? Who are you?â asked Anatole in a breathless whisper.
 32607	
 32608	âKindly step in, my orders are to bring you in.â
 32609	
 32610	âKurÃ¡gin! Come back!â shouted DÃ³lokhov. âBetrayed! Back!â
 32611	
 32612	DÃ³lokhov, after Anatole entered, had remained at the wicket gate and was
 32613	struggling with the yard porter who was trying to lock it. With a last
 32614	desperate effort DÃ³lokhov pushed the porter aside, and when Anatole ran
 32615	back seized him by the arm, pulled him through the wicket, and ran back
 32616	with him to the troyka.
 32617	
 32618	
 32619	
 32620	
 32621	
 32622	CHAPTER XVIII
 32623	
 32624	MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna, having found SÃ³nya weeping in the corridor, made her
 32625	confess everything, and intercepting the note to NatÃ¡sha she read it and
 32626	went into NatÃ¡shaâs room with it in her hand.
 32627	
 32628	âYou shameless good-for-nothing!â said she. âI wonât hear a word.â
 32629	
 32630	Pushing back NatÃ¡sha who looked at her with astonished but tearless
 32631	eyes, she locked her in; and having given orders to the yard porter to
 32632	admit the persons who would be coming that evening, but not to let them
 32633	out again, and having told the footman to bring them up to her, she
 32634	seated herself in the drawing room to await the abductors.
 32635	
 32636	When Gabriel came to inform her that the men who had come had run
 32637	away again, she rose frowning, and clasping her hands behind her paced
 32638	through the rooms a long time considering what she should do. Toward
 32639	midnight she went to NatÃ¡shaâs room fingering the key in her pocket.
 32640	SÃ³nya was sitting sobbing in the corridor. âMÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna, for Godâs
 32641	sake let me in to her!â she pleaded, but MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna unlocked
 32642	the door and went in without giving her an answer.... âDisgusting,
 32643	abominable... In my house... horrid girl, hussy! Iâm only sorry for her
 32644	father!â thought she, trying to restrain her wrath. âHard as it may
 32645	be, Iâll tell them all to hold their tongues and will hide it from the
 32646	count.â She entered the room with resolute steps. NatÃ¡sha lying on the
 32647	sofa, her head hidden in her hands, and she did not stir. She was in
 32648	just the same position in which MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna had left her.
 32649	
 32650	âA nice girl! Very nice!â said MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna. âArranging meetings
 32651	with lovers in my house! Itâs no use pretending: you listen when I speak
 32652	to you!â And MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna touched her arm. âListen when I speak!
 32653	Youâve disgraced yourself like the lowest of hussies. Iâd treat you
 32654	differently, but Iâm sorry for your father, so I will conceal it.â
 32655	
 32656	NatÃ¡sha did not change her position, but her whole body heaved with
 32657	noiseless, convulsive sobs which choked her. MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna glanced
 32658	round at SÃ³nya and seated herself on the sofa beside NatÃ¡sha.
 32659	
 32660	âItâs lucky for him that he escaped me; but Iâll find him!â she said in
 32661	her rough voice. âDo you hear what I am saying or not?â she added.
 32662	
 32663	She put her large hand under NatÃ¡shaâs face and turned it toward her.
 32664	Both MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna and SÃ³nya were amazed when they saw how NatÃ¡sha
 32665	looked. Her eyes were dry and glistening, her lips compressed, her
 32666	cheeks sunken.
 32667	
 32668	âLet me be!... What is it to me?... I shall die!â she muttered,
 32669	wrenching herself from MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievnaâs hands with a vicious effort
 32670	and sinking down again into her former position.
 32671	
 32672	âNatalie!â said MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna. âI wish for your good. Lie still,
 32673	stay like that then, I wonât touch you. But listen. I wonât tell you how
 32674	guilty you are. You know that yourself. But when your father comes back
 32675	tomorrow what am I to tell him? Eh?â
 32676	
 32677	Again NatÃ¡shaâs body shook with sobs.
 32678	
 32679	âSuppose he finds out, and your brother, and your betrothed?â
 32680	
 32681	âI have no betrothed: I have refused him!â cried NatÃ¡sha.
 32682	
 32683	âThatâs all the same,â continued MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna. âIf they hear of
 32684	this, will they let it pass? He, your father, I know him... if he
 32685	challenges him to a duel will that be all right? Eh?â
 32686	
 32687	âOh, let me be! Why have you interfered at all? Why? Why? Who asked
 32688	you to?â shouted NatÃ¡sha, raising herself on the sofa and looking
 32689	malignantly at MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna.
 32690	
 32691	âBut what did you want?â cried MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna, growing angry again.
 32692	âWere you kept under lock and key? Who hindered his coming to the house?
 32693	Why carry you off as if you were some gypsy singing girl?... Well, if he
 32694	had carried you off... do you think they wouldnât have found him?
 32695	Your father, or brother, or your betrothed? And heâs a scoundrel, a
 32696	wretchâthatâs a fact!â
 32697	
 32698	âHe is better than any of you!â exclaimed NatÃ¡sha getting up. âIf you
 32699	hadnât interfered... Oh, my God! What is it all? What is it? SÃ³nya,
 32700	why?... Go away!â
 32701	
 32702	And she burst into sobs with the despairing vehemence with which people
 32703	bewail disasters they feel they have themselves occasioned. MÃ¡rya
 32704	DmÃ­trievna was to speak again but NatÃ¡sha cried out:
 32705	
 32706	âGo away! Go away! You all hate and despise me!â and she threw herself
 32707	back on the sofa.
 32708	
 32709	MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna went on admonishing her for some time, enjoining on her
 32710	that it must all be kept from her father and assuring her that nobody
 32711	would know anything about it if only NatÃ¡sha herself would undertake
 32712	to forget it all and not let anyone see that something had happened.
 32713	NatÃ¡sha did not reply, nor did she sob any longer, but she grew cold
 32714	and had a shivering fit. MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna put a pillow under her head,
 32715	covered her with two quilts, and herself brought her some lime-flower
 32716	water, but NatÃ¡sha did not respond to her.
 32717	
 32718	âWell, let her sleep,â said MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna as she went out of the room
 32719	supposing NatÃ¡sha to be asleep.
 32720	
 32721	But NatÃ¡sha was not asleep; with pale face and fixed wide-open eyes she
 32722	looked straight before her. All that night she did not sleep or weep and
 32723	did not speak to SÃ³nya who got up and went to her several times.
 32724	
 32725	Next day Count RostÃ³v returned from his estate near Moscow in time for
 32726	lunch as he had promised. He was in very good spirits; the affair with
 32727	the purchaser was going on satisfactorily, and there was nothing to keep
 32728	him any longer in Moscow, away from the countess whom he missed. MÃ¡rya
 32729	DmÃ­trievna met him and told him that NatÃ¡sha had been very unwell the
 32730	day before and that they had sent for the doctor, but that she was
 32731	better now. NatÃ¡sha had not left her room that morning. With compressed
 32732	and parched lips and dry fixed eyes, she sat at the window, uneasily
 32733	watching the people who drove past and hurriedly glancing round at
 32734	anyone who entered the room. She was evidently expecting news of him and
 32735	that he would come or would write to her.
 32736	
 32737	When the count came to see her she turned anxiously round at the sound
 32738	of a manâs footstep, and then her face resumed its cold and malevolent
 32739	expression. She did not even get up to greet him. âWhat is the matter
 32740	with you, my angel? Are you ill?â asked the count.
 32741	
 32742	After a momentâs silence NatÃ¡sha answered: âYes, ill.â
 32743	
 32744	In reply to the countâs anxious inquiries as to why she was so dejected
 32745	and whether anything had happened to her betrothed, she assured him
 32746	that nothing had happened and asked him not to worry. MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna
 32747	confirmed NatÃ¡shaâs assurances that nothing had happened. From
 32748	the pretense of illness, from his daughterâs distress, and by the
 32749	embarrassed faces of SÃ³nya and MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna, the count saw clearly
 32750	that something had gone wrong during his absence, but it was so terrible
 32751	for him to think that anything disgraceful had happened to his beloved
 32752	daughter, and he so prized his own cheerful tranquillity, that he
 32753	avoided inquiries and tried to assure himself that nothing particularly
 32754	had happened; and he was only dissatisfied that her indisposition
 32755	delayed their return to the country.
 32756

 32761	CHAPTER XIX
 32762	
 32763	From the day his wife arrived in Moscow Pierre had been intending to go
 32764	away somewhere, so as not to be near her. Soon after the RostÃ³vs came
 32765	to Moscow the effect NatÃ¡sha had on him made him hasten to carry out
 32766	his intention. He went to Tver to see Joseph AlexÃ©evichâs widow, who
 32767	had long since promised to hand over to him some papers of her deceased
 32768	husbandâs.
 32769	
 32770	When he returned to Moscow Pierre was handed a letter from MÃ¡rya
 32771	DmÃ­trievna asking him to come and see her on a matter of great
 32772	importance relating to Andrew BolkÃ³nski and his betrothed. Pierre had
 32773	been avoiding NatÃ¡sha because it seemed to him that his feeling for her
 32774	was stronger than a married manâs should be for his friendâs fiancÃ©e.
 32775	Yet some fate constantly threw them together.
 32776	
 32777	âWhat can have happened? And what can they want with me?â thought he
 32778	as he dressed to go to MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievnaâs. âIf only Prince Andrew would
 32779	hurry up and come and marry her!â thought he on his way to the house.
 32780	
 32781	On the TverskÃ³y Boulevard a familiar voice called to him.
 32782	
 32783	âPierre! Been back long?â someone shouted. Pierre raised his head. In
 32784	a sleigh drawn by two gray trotting-horses that were bespattering the
 32785	dashboard with snow, Anatole and his constant companion MakÃ¡rin dashed
 32786	past. Anatole was sitting upright in the classic pose of military
 32787	dandies, the lower part of his face hidden by his beaver collar and his
 32788	head slightly bent. His face was fresh and rosy, his white-plumed hat,
 32789	tilted to one side, disclosed his curled and pomaded hair besprinkled
 32790	with powdery snow.
 32791	
 32792	âYes, indeed, thatâs a true sage,â thought Pierre. âHe sees nothing
 32793	beyond the pleasure of the moment, nothing troubles him and so he is
 32794	always cheerful, satisfied, and serene. What wouldnât I give to be like
 32795	him!â he thought enviously.
 32796	
 32797	In MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievnaâs anteroom the footman who helped him off with his
 32798	fur coat said that the mistress asked him to come to her bedroom.
 32799	
 32800	When he opened the ballroom door Pierre saw NatÃ¡sha sitting at the
 32801	window, with a thin, pale, and spiteful face. She glanced round at him,
 32802	frowned, and left the room with an expression of cold dignity.
 32803	
 32804	âWhat has happened?â asked Pierre, entering MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievnaâs room.
 32805	
 32806	âFine doings!â answered DmÃ­trievna. âFor fifty-eight years have I lived
 32807	in this world and never known anything so disgraceful!â
 32808	
 32809	And having put him on his honor not to repeat anything she told him,
 32810	MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna informed him that NatÃ¡sha had refused Prince Andrew
 32811	without her parentsâ knowledge and that the cause of this was Anatole
 32812	KurÃ¡gin into whose society Pierreâs wife had thrown her and with whom
 32813	NatÃ¡sha had tried to elope during her fatherâs absence, in order to be
 32814	married secretly.
 32815	
 32816	Pierre raised his shoulders and listened open-mouthed to what was told
 32817	him, scarcely able to believe his own ears. That Prince Andrewâs
 32818	deeply loved affianced wifeâthe same NatÃ¡sha RostÃ³va who used to be so
 32819	charmingâshould give up BolkÃ³nski for that fool Anatole who was already
 32820	secretly married (as Pierre knew), and should be so in love with him as
 32821	to agree to run away with him, was something Pierre could not conceive
 32822	and could not imagine.
 32823	
 32824	He could not reconcile the charming impression he had of NatÃ¡sha, whom
 32825	he had known from a child, with this new conception of her baseness,
 32826	folly, and cruelty. He thought of his wife. âThey are all alike!â he
 32827	said to himself, reflecting that he was not the only man unfortunate
 32828	enough to be tied to a bad woman. But still he pitied Prince Andrew to
 32829	the point of tears and sympathized with his wounded pride, and the more
 32830	he pitied his friend the more did he think with contempt and even with
 32831	disgust of that NatÃ¡sha who had just passed him in the ballroom with
 32832	such a look of cold dignity. He did not know that NatÃ¡shaâs soul was
 32833	overflowing with despair, shame, and humiliation, and that it was not
 32834	her fault that her face happened to assume an expression of calm dignity
 32835	and severity.
 32836	
 32837	âBut how get married?â said Pierre, in answer to MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna. âHe
 32838	could not marryâhe is married!â
 32839	
 32840	âThings get worse from hour to hour!â ejaculated MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna. âA
 32841	nice youth! What a scoundrel! And sheâs expecting himâexpecting him
 32842	since yesterday. She must be told! Then at least she wonât go on
 32843	expecting him.â
 32844	
 32845	After hearing the details of Anatoleâs marriage from Pierre, and giving
 32846	vent to her anger against Anatole in words of abuse, MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna
 32847	told Pierre why she had sent for him. She was afraid that the count or
 32848	BolkÃ³nski, who might arrive at any moment, if they knew of this affair
 32849	(which she hoped to hide from them) might challenge Anatole to a duel,
 32850	and she therefore asked Pierre to tell his brother-in-law in her name to
 32851	leave Moscow and not dare to let her set eyes on him again. Pierreâonly
 32852	now realizing the danger to the old count, Nicholas, and Prince
 32853	Andrewâpromised to do as she wished. Having briefly and exactly
 32854	explained her wishes to him, she let him go to the drawing room.
 32855	
 32856	âMind, the count knows nothing. Behave as if you know nothing either,â
 32857	she said. âAnd I will go and tell her it is no use expecting him! And
 32858	stay to dinner if you care to!â she called after Pierre.
 32859	
 32860	Pierre met the old count, who seemed nervous and upset. That morning
 32861	NatÃ¡sha had told him that she had rejected BolkÃ³nski.
 32862	
 32863	âTroubles, troubles, my dear fellow!â he said to Pierre. âWhat troubles
 32864	one has with these girls without their mother! I do so regret having
 32865	come here.... I will be frank with you. Have you heard she has broken
 32866	off her engagement without consulting anybody? Itâs true this engagement
 32867	never was much to my liking. Of course he is an excellent man, but
 32868	still, with his fatherâs disapproval they wouldnât have been happy, and
 32869	NatÃ¡sha wonât lack suitors. Still, it has been going on so long, and
 32870	to take such a step without fatherâs or motherâs consent! And now sheâs
 32871	ill, and God knows what! Itâs hard, Count, hard to manage daughters in
 32872	their motherâs absence....â
 32873	
 32874	Pierre saw that the count was much upset and tried to change the
 32875	subject, but the count returned to his troubles.
 32876	
 32877	SÃ³nya entered the room with an agitated face.
 32878	
 32879	âNatÃ¡sha is not quite well; sheâs in her room and would like to see you.
 32880	MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna is with her and she too asks you to come.â
 32881	
 32882	âYes, you are a great friend of BolkÃ³nskiâs, no doubt she wants to send
 32883	him a message,â said the count. âOh dear! Oh dear! How happy it all
 32884	was!â
 32885	
 32886	And clutching the spare gray locks on his temples the count left the
 32887	room.
 32888	
 32889	When MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna told NatÃ¡sha that Anatole was married, NatÃ¡sha
 32890	did not wish to believe it and insisted on having it confirmed by Pierre
 32891	himself. SÃ³nya told Pierre this as she led him along the corridor to
 32892	NatÃ¡shaâs room.
 32893	
 32894	NatÃ¡sha, pale and stern, was sitting beside MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna, and her
 32895	eyes, glittering feverishly, met Pierre with a questioning look the
 32896	moment he entered. She did not smile or nod, but only gazed fixedly at
 32897	him, and her look asked only one thing: was he a friend, or like the
 32898	others an enemy in regard to Anatole? As for Pierre, he evidently did
 32899	not exist for her.
 32900	
 32901	âHe knows all about it,â said MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna pointing to Pierre and
 32902	addressing NatÃ¡sha. âLet him tell you whether I have told the truth.â
 32903	
 32904	NatÃ¡sha looked from one to the other as a hunted and wounded animal
 32905	looks at the approaching dogs and sportsmen.
 32906	
 32907	âNatÃ¡lya IlynÃ­chna,â Pierre began, dropping his eyes with a feeling of
 32908	pity for her and loathing for the thing he had to do, âwhether it is
 32909	true or not should make no difference to you, because...â
 32910	
 32911	âThen it is not true that heâs married!â
 32912	
 32913	âYes, it is true.â
 32914	
 32915	âHas he been married long?â she asked. âOn your honor?...â
 32916	
 32917	Pierre gave his word of honor.
 32918	
 32919	âIs he still here?â she asked, quickly.
 32920	
 32921	âYes, I have just seen him.â
 32922	
 32923	She was evidently unable to speak and made a sign with her hands that
 32924	they should leave her alone.
 32925	
 32926	
 32927	
 32928	
 32929	
 32930	CHAPTER XX
 32931	
 32932	Pierre did not stay for dinner, but left the room and went away at once.
 32933	He drove through the town seeking Anatole KurÃ¡gin, at the thought of
 32934	whom now the blood rushed to his heart and he felt a difficulty in
 32935	breathing. He was not at the ice hills, nor at the gypsiesâ, nor at
 32936	Komonenoâs. Pierre drove to the Club. In the Club all was going on as
 32937	usual. The members who were assembling for dinner were sitting about
 32938	in groups; they greeted Pierre and spoke of the town news. The footman
 32939	having greeted him, knowing his habits and his acquaintances, told him
 32940	there was a place left for him in the small dining room and that Prince
 32941	Michael ZakhÃ¡rych was in the library, but Paul TimofÃ©evich had not yet
 32942	arrived. One of Pierreâs acquaintances, while they were talking about
 32943	the weather, asked if he had heard of KurÃ¡ginâs abduction of RostÃ³va
 32944	which was talked of in the town, and was it true? Pierre laughed and
 32945	said it was nonsense for he had just come from the RostÃ³vsâ. He asked
 32946	everyone about Anatole. One man told him he had not come yet, and
 32947	another that he was coming to dinner. Pierre felt it strange to see this
 32948	calm, indifferent crowd of people unaware of what was going on in his
 32949	soul. He paced through the ballroom, waited till everyone had come, and
 32950	as Anatole had not turned up did not stay for dinner but drove home.
 32951	
 32952	Anatole, for whom Pierre was looking, dined that day with DÃ³lokhov,
 32953	consulting him as to how to remedy this unfortunate affair. It seemed to
 32954	him essential to see NatÃ¡sha. In the evening he drove to his sisterâs
 32955	to discuss with her how to arrange a meeting. When Pierre returned home
 32956	after vainly hunting all over Moscow, his valet informed him that Prince
 32957	Anatole was with the countess. The countessâ drawing room was full of
 32958	guests.
 32959	
 32960	Pierre without greeting his wife whom he had not seen since his
 32961	returnâat that moment she was more repulsive to him than everâentered
 32962	the drawing room and seeing Anatole went up to him.
 32963	
 32964	âAh, Pierre,â said the countess going up to her husband. âYou donât know
 32965	what a plight our Anatole...â
 32966	
 32967	She stopped, seeing in the forward thrust of her husbandâs head, in his
 32968	glowing eyes and his resolute gait, the terrible indications of that
 32969	rage and strength which she knew and had herself experienced after his
 32970	duel with DÃ³lokhov.
 32971	
 32972	âWhere you are, there is vice and evil!â said Pierre to his wife.
 32973	âAnatole, come with me! I must speak to you,â he added in French.
 32974	
 32975	Anatole glanced round at his sister and rose submissively, ready to
 32976	follow Pierre. Pierre, taking him by the arm, pulled him toward himself
 32977	and was leading him from the room.
 32978	
 32979	âIf you allow yourself in my drawing room...â whispered HÃ©lÃ¨ne, but
 32980	Pierre did not reply and went out of the room.
 32981	
 32982	Anatole followed him with his usual jaunty step but his face betrayed
 32983	anxiety.
 32984	
 32985	Having entered his study Pierre closed the door and addressed Anatole
 32986	without looking at him.
 32987	
 32988	âYou promised Countess RostÃ³va to marry her and were about to elope with
 32989	her, is that so?â
 32990	
 32991	âMon cher,â answered Anatole (their whole conversation was in French),
 32992	âI donât consider myself bound to answer questions put to me in that
 32993	tone.â
 32994	
 32995	Pierreâs face, already pale, became distorted by fury. He seized Anatole
 32996	by the collar of his uniform with his big hand and shook him from side
 32997	to side till Anatoleâs face showed a sufficient degree of terror.
 32998	
 32999	âWhen I tell you that I must talk to you!...â repeated Pierre.
 33000	
 33001	âCome now, this is stupid. What?â said Anatole, fingering a button of
 33002	his collar that had been wrenched loose with a bit of the cloth.
 33003	
 33004	âYouâre a scoundrel and a blackguard, and I donât know what deprives
 33005	me from the pleasure of smashing your head with this!â said Pierre,
 33006	expressing himself so artificially because he was talking French.
 33007	
 33008	He took a heavy paperweight and lifted it threateningly, but at once put
 33009	it back in its place.
 33010	
 33011	âDid you promise to marry her?â
 33012	
 33013	âI... I didnât think of it. I never promised, because...â
 33014	
 33015	Pierre interrupted him.
 33016	
 33017	âHave you any letters of hers? Any letters?â he said, moving toward
 33018	Anatole.
 33019	
 33020	Anatole glanced at him and immediately thrust his hand into his pocket
 33021	and drew out his pocketbook.
 33022	
 33023	Pierre took the letter Anatole handed him and, pushing aside a table
 33024	that stood in his way, threw himself on the sofa.
 33025	
 33026	âI shanât be violent, donât be afraid!â said Pierre in answer to a
 33027	frightened gesture of Anatoleâs. âFirst, the letters,â said he, as if
 33028	repeating a lesson to himself. âSecondly,â he continued after a short
 33029	pause, again rising and again pacing the room, âtomorrow you must get
 33030	out of Moscow.â
 33031	
 33032	âBut how can I?...â
 33033	
 33034	âThirdly,â Pierre continued without listening to him, âyou must never
 33035	breathe a word of what has passed between you and Countess RostÃ³va.
 33036	I know I canât prevent your doing so, but if you have a spark of
 33037	conscience...â Pierre paced the room several times in silence.
 33038	
 33039	Anatole sat at a table frowning and biting his lips.
 33040	
 33041	âAfter all, you must understand that besides your pleasure there is such
 33042	a thing as other peopleâs happiness and peace, and that you are ruining
 33043	a whole life for the sake of amusing yourself! Amuse yourself with women
 33044	like my wifeâwith them you are within your rights, for they know what
 33045	you want of them. They are armed against you by the same experience
 33046	of debauchery; but to promise a maid to marry her... to deceive, to
 33047	kidnap.... Donât you understand that it is as mean as beating an old man
 33048	or a child?...â
 33049	
 33050	Pierre paused and looked at Anatole no longer with an angry but with a
 33051	questioning look.
 33052	
 33053	âI donât know about that, eh?â said Anatole, growing more confident as
 33054	Pierre mastered his wrath. âI donât know that and donât want to,â he
 33055	said, not looking at Pierre and with a slight tremor of his lower jaw,
 33056	âbut you have used such words to meââmeanâ and so onâwhich as a man of
 33057	honor I canât allow anyone to use.â
 33058	
 33059	Pierre glanced at him with amazement, unable to understand what he
 33060	wanted.
 33061	
 33062	âThough it was tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte,â Anatole continued, âstill I canât...â
 33063	
 33064	âIs it satisfaction you want?â said Pierre ironically.
 33065	
 33066	âYou could at least take back your words. What? If you want me to do as
 33067	you wish, eh?â
 33068	
 33069	âI take them back, I take them back!â said Pierre, âand I ask you to
 33070	forgive me.â Pierre involuntarily glanced at the loose button. âAnd if
 33071	you require money for your journey...â
 33072	
 33073	Anatole smiled. The expression of that base and cringing smile, which
 33074	Pierre knew so well in his wife, revolted him.
 33075	
 33076	âOh, vile and heartless brood!â he exclaimed, and left the room.
 33077	
 33078	Next day Anatole left for Petersburg.

 33084	CHAPTER XXI
 33085	
 33086	Pierre drove to MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievnaâs to tell her of the fulfillment of her
 33087	wish that KurÃ¡gin should be banished from Moscow. The whole house was in
 33088	a state of alarm and commotion. NatÃ¡sha was very ill, having, as MÃ¡rya
 33089	DmÃ­trievna told him in secret, poisoned herself the night after she had
 33090	been told that Anatole was married, with some arsenic she had stealthily
 33091	procured. After swallowing a little she had been so frightened that she
 33092	woke SÃ³nya and told her what she had done. The necessary antidotes had
 33093	been administered in time and she was now out of danger, though still so
 33094	weak that it was out of the question to move her to the country, and
 33095	so the countess had been sent for. Pierre saw the distracted count, and
 33096	SÃ³nya, who had a tear-stained face, but he could not see NatÃ¡sha.
 33097	
 33098	Pierre dined at the club that day and heard on all sides gossip about
 33099	the attempted abduction of RostÃ³va. He resolutely denied these
 33100	rumors, assuring everyone that nothing had happened except that his
 33101	brother-in-law had proposed to her and been refused. It seemed to
 33102	Pierre that it was his duty to conceal the whole affair and re-establish
 33103	NatÃ¡shaâs reputation.
 33104	
 33105	He was awaiting Prince Andrewâs return with dread and went every day to
 33106	the old princeâs for news of him.
 33107	
 33108	Old Prince BolkÃ³nski heard all the rumors current in the town from
 33109	Mademoiselle Bourienne and had read the note to Princess Mary in which
 33110	NatÃ¡sha had broken off her engagement. He seemed in better spirits than
 33111	usual and awaited his son with great impatience.
 33112	
 33113	Some days after Anatoleâs departure Pierre received a note from Prince
 33114	Andrew, informing him of his arrival and asking him to come to see him.
 33115	
 33116	As soon as he reached Moscow, Prince Andrew had received from his
 33117	father NatÃ¡shaâs note to Princess Mary breaking off her engagement
 33118	(Mademoiselle Bourienne had purloined it from Princess Mary and given
 33119	it to the old prince), and he heard from him the story of NatÃ¡shaâs
 33120	elopement, with additions.
 33121	
 33122	Prince Andrew had arrived in the evening and Pierre came to see him next
 33123	morning. Pierre expected to find Prince Andrew in almost the same state
 33124	as NatÃ¡sha and was therefore surprised on entering the drawing room
 33125	to hear him in the study talking in a loud animated voice about some
 33126	intrigue going on in Petersburg. The old princeâs voice and another now
 33127	and then interrupted him. Princess Mary came out to meet Pierre. She
 33128	sighed, looking toward the door of the room where Prince Andrew was,
 33129	evidently intending to express her sympathy with his sorrow, but Pierre
 33130	saw by her face that she was glad both at what had happened and at the
 33131	way her brother had taken the news of NatÃ¡shaâs faithlessness.
 33132	
 33133	âHe says he expected it,â she remarked. âI know his pride will not let
 33134	him express his feelings, but still he has taken it better, far better,
 33135	than I expected. Evidently it had to be....â
 33136	
 33137	âBut is it possible that all is really ended?â asked Pierre.
 33138	
 33139	Princess Mary looked at him with astonishment. She did not understand
 33140	how he could ask such a question. Pierre went into the study. Prince
 33141	Andrew, greatly changed and plainly in better health, but with a fresh
 33142	horizontal wrinkle between his brows, stood in civilian dress facing
 33143	his father and Prince MeshchÃ©rski, warmly disputing and vigorously
 33144	gesticulating. The conversation was about SperÃ¡nskiâthe news of whose
 33145	sudden exile and alleged treachery had just reached Moscow.
 33146	
 33147	âNow he is censured and accused by all who were enthusiastic about him
 33148	a month ago,â Prince Andrew was saying, âand by those who were unable to
 33149	understand his aims. To judge a man who is in disfavor and to throw on
 33150	him all the blame of other menâs mistakes is very easy, but I maintain
 33151	that if anything good has been accomplished in this reign it was done by
 33152	him, by him alone.â
 33153	
 33154	He paused at the sight of Pierre. His face quivered and immediately
 33155	assumed a vindictive expression.
 33156	
 33157	âPosterity will do him justice,â he concluded, and at once turned to
 33158	Pierre.
 33159	
 33160	âWell, how are you? Still getting stouter?â he said with animation, but
 33161	the new wrinkle on his forehead deepened. âYes, I am well,â he said in
 33162	answer to Pierreâs question, and smiled.
 33163	
 33164	To Pierre that smile said plainly: âI am well, but my health is now of
 33165	no use to anyone.â
 33166	
 33167	After a few words to Pierre about the awful roads from the Polish
 33168	frontier, about people he had met in Switzerland who knew Pierre, and
 33169	about M. Dessalles, whom he had brought from abroad to be his sonâs
 33170	tutor, Prince Andrew again joined warmly in the conversation about
 33171	SperÃ¡nski which was still going on between the two old men.
 33172	
 33173	âIf there were treason, or proofs of secret relations with Napoleon,
 33174	they would have been made public,â he said with warmth and haste. âI do
 33175	not, and never did, like SperÃ¡nski personally, but I like justice!â
 33176	
 33177	Pierre now recognized in his friend a need with which he was only too
 33178	familiar, to get excited and to have arguments about extraneous matters
 33179	in order to stifle thoughts that were too oppressive and too intimate.
 33180	When Prince MeshchÃ©rski had left, Prince Andrew took Pierreâs arm and
 33181	asked him into the room that had been assigned him. A bed had been made
 33182	up there, and some open portmanteaus and trunks stood about. Prince
 33183	Andrew went to one and took out a small casket, from which he drew a
 33184	packet wrapped in paper. He did it all silently and very quickly. He
 33185	stood up and coughed. His face was gloomy and his lips compressed.
 33186	
 33187	âForgive me for troubling you....â
 33188	
 33189	Pierre saw that Prince Andrew was going to speak of NatÃ¡sha, and his
 33190	broad face expressed pity and sympathy. This expression irritated Prince
 33191	Andrew, and in a determined, ringing, and unpleasant tone he continued:
 33192	
 33193	âI have received a refusal from Countess RostÃ³va and have heard reports
 33194	of your brother-in-law having sought her hand, or something of that
 33195	kind. Is that true?â
 33196	
 33197	âBoth true and untrue,â Pierre began; but Prince Andrew interrupted him.
 33198	
 33199	âHere are her letters and her portrait,â said he.
 33200	
 33201	He took the packet from the table and handed it to Pierre.
 33202	
 33203	âGive this to the countess... if you see her.â
 33204	
 33205	âShe is very ill,â said Pierre.
 33206	
 33207	âThen she is here still?â said Prince Andrew. âAnd Prince KurÃ¡gin?â he
 33208	added quickly.
 33209	
 33210	âHe left long ago. She has been at deathâs door.â
 33211	
 33212	âI much regret her illness,â said Prince Andrew; and he smiled like his
 33213	father, coldly, maliciously, and unpleasantly.
 33214	
 33215	âSo Monsieur KurÃ¡gin has not honored Countess RostÃ³va with his hand?â
 33216	said Prince Andrew, and he snorted several times.
 33217	
 33218	âHe could not marry, for he was married already,â said Pierre.
 33219	
 33220	Prince Andrew laughed disagreeably, again reminding one of his father.
 33221	
 33222	âAnd where is your brother-in-law now, if I may ask?â he said.
 33223	
 33224	âHe has gone to Peters... But I donât know,â said Pierre.
 33225	
 33226	âWell, it doesnât matter,â said Prince Andrew. âTell Countess RostÃ³va
 33227	that she was and is perfectly free and that I wish her all that is
 33228	good.â
 33229	
 33230	Pierre took the packet. Prince Andrew, as if trying to remember whether
 33231	he had something more to say, or waiting to see if Pierre would say
 33232	anything, looked fixedly at him.
 33233	
 33234	âI say, do you remember our discussion in Petersburg?â asked Pierre,
 33235	âabout...â
 33236	
 33237	âYes,â returned Prince Andrew hastily. âI said that a fallen woman
 33238	should be forgiven, but I didnât say I could forgive her. I canât.â
 33239	
 33240	âBut can this be compared...?â said Pierre.
 33241	
 33242	Prince Andrew interrupted him and cried sharply: âYes, ask her hand
 33243	again, be magnanimous, and so on?... Yes, that would be very noble, but
 33244	I am unable to follow in that gentlemanâs footsteps. If you wish to be
 33245	my friend never speak to me of that... of all that! Well, good-by. So
 33246	youâll give her the packet?â
 33247	
 33248	Pierre left the room and went to the old prince and Princess Mary.
 33249	
 33250	The old man seemed livelier than usual. Princess Mary was the same as
 33251	always, but beneath her sympathy for her brother, Pierre noticed her
 33252	satisfaction that the engagement had been broken off. Looking at them
 33253	Pierre realized what contempt and animosity they all felt for the
 33254	RostÃ³vs, and that it was impossible in their presence even to mention
 33255	the name of her who could give up Prince Andrew for anyone else.
 33256	
 33257	At dinner the talk turned on the war, the approach of which was becoming
 33258	evident. Prince Andrew talked incessantly, arguing now with his father,
 33259	now with the Swiss tutor Dessalles, and showing an unnatural animation,
 33260	the cause of which Pierre so well understood.
 33261	
 33262	
 33263	
 33264	
 33265	
 33266	CHAPTER XXII
 33267	
 33268	That same evening Pierre went to the RostÃ³vsâ to fulfill the commission
 33269	entrusted to him. NatÃ¡sha was in bed, the count at the club, and Pierre,
 33270	after giving the letters to SÃ³nya, went to MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna who was
 33271	interested to know how Prince Andrew had taken the news. Ten minutes
 33272	later SÃ³nya came to MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna.
 33273	
 33274	âNatÃ¡sha insists on seeing Count Peter KirÃ­lovich,â said she.
 33275	
 33276	âBut how? Are we to take him up to her? The room there has not been
 33277	tidied up.â
 33278	
 33279	âNo, she has dressed and gone into the drawing room,â said SÃ³nya.
 33280	
 33281	MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna only shrugged her shoulders.
 33282	
 33283	âWhen will her mother come? She has worried me to death! Now mind, donât
 33284	tell her everything!â said she to Pierre. âOne hasnât the heart to scold
 33285	her, she is so much to be pitied, so much to be pitied.â
 33286	
 33287	NatÃ¡sha was standing in the middle of the drawing room, emaciated, with
 33288	a pale set face, but not at all shamefaced as Pierre expected to find
 33289	her. When he appeared at the door she grew flurried, evidently undecided
 33290	whether to go to meet him or to wait till he came up.
 33291	
 33292	Pierre hastened to her. He thought she would give him her hand as
 33293	usual; but she, stepping up to him, stopped, breathing heavily, her arms
 33294	hanging lifelessly just in the pose she used to stand in when she
 33295	went to the middle of the ballroom to sing, but with quite a different
 33296	expression of face.
 33297	
 33298	âPeter KirÃ­lovich,â she began rapidly, âPrince BolkÃ³nski was your
 33299	friendâis your friend,â she corrected herself. (It seemed to her that
 33300	everything that had once been must now be different.) âHe told me once
 33301	to apply to you...â
 33302	
 33303	Pierre sniffed as he looked at her, but did not speak. Till then he had
 33304	reproached her in his heart and tried to despise her, but he now felt so
 33305	sorry for her that there was no room in his soul for reproach.
 33306	
 33307	âHe is here now: tell him... to for... forgive me!â She stopped and
 33308	breathed still more quickly, but did not shed tears.
 33309	
 33310	âYes... I will tell him,â answered Pierre; âbut...â
 33311	
 33312	He did not know what to say.
 33313	
 33314	NatÃ¡sha was evidently dismayed at the thought of what he might think she
 33315	had meant.
 33316	
 33317	âNo, I know all is over,â she said hurriedly. âNo, that can never be.
 33318	Iâm only tormented by the wrong I have done him. Tell him only that I
 33319	beg him to forgive, forgive, forgive me for everything....â
 33320	
 33321	She trembled all over and sat down on a chair.
 33322	
 33323	A sense of pity he had never before known overflowed Pierreâs heart.
 33324	
 33325	âI will tell him, I will tell him everything once more,â said Pierre.
 33326	âBut... I should like to know one thing....â
 33327	
 33328	âKnow what?â NatÃ¡shaâs eyes asked.
 33329	
 33330	âI should like to know, did you love...â Pierre did not know how to
 33331	refer to Anatole and flushed at the thought of himââdid you love that
 33332	bad man?â
 33333	
 33334	âDonât call him bad!â said NatÃ¡sha. âBut I donât know, donât know at
 33335	all....â
 33336	
 33337	She began to cry and a still greater sense of pity, tenderness, and love
 33338	welled up in Pierre. He felt the tears trickle under his spectacles and
 33339	hoped they would not be noticed.
 33340	
 33341	âWe wonât speak of it any more, my dear,â said Pierre, and his gentle,
 33342	cordial tone suddenly seemed very strange to NatÃ¡sha.
 33343	
 33344	âWe wonât speak of it, my dearâIâll tell him everything; but one thing
 33345	I beg of you, consider me your friend and if you want help, advice,
 33346	or simply to open your heart to someoneânot now, but when your mind is
 33347	clearer think of me!â He took her hand and kissed it. âI shall be happy
 33348	if itâs in my power...â
 33349	
 33350	Pierre grew confused.
 33351	
 33352	âDonât speak to me like that. I am not worth it!â exclaimed NatÃ¡sha and
 33353	turned to leave the room, but Pierre held her hand.
 33354	
 33355	He knew he had something more to say to her. But when he said it he was
 33356	amazed at his own words.
 33357	
 33358	âStop, stop! You have your whole life before you,â said he to her.
 33359	
 33360	âBefore me? No! All is over for me,â she replied with shame and
 33361	self-abasement.
 33362	
 33363	âAll over?â he repeated. âIf I were not myself, but the handsomest,
 33364	cleverest, and best man in the world, and were free, I would this moment
 33365	ask on my knees for your hand and your love!â
 33366	
 33367	For the first time for many days NatÃ¡sha wept tears of gratitude and
 33368	tenderness, and glancing at Pierre she went out of the room.
 33369	
 33370	Pierre too when she had gone almost ran into the anteroom, restraining
 33371	tears of tenderness and joy that choked him, and without finding the
 33372	sleeves of his fur cloak threw it on and got into his sleigh.
 33373	
 33374	âWhere to now, your excellency?â asked the coachman.
 33375	
 33376	âWhere to?â Pierre asked himself. âWhere can I go now? Surely not to the
 33377	Club or to pay calls?â All men seemed so pitiful, so poor, in comparison
 33378	with this feeling of tenderness and love he experienced: in comparison
 33379	with that softened, grateful, last look she had given him through her
 33380	tears.
 33381	
 33382	âHome!â said Pierre, and despite twenty-two degrees of frost Fahrenheit
 33383	he threw open the bearskin cloak from his broad chest and inhaled the
 33384	air with joy.
 33385	
 33386	It was clear and frosty. Above the dirty, ill-lit streets, above the
 33387	black roofs, stretched the dark starry sky. Only looking up at the sky
 33388	did Pierre cease to feel how sordid and humiliating were all mundane
 33389	things compared with the heights to which his soul had just been raised.
 33390	At the entrance to the ArbÃ¡t Square an immense expanse of dark starry
 33391	sky presented itself to his eyes. Almost in the center of it, above the
 33392	PrechÃ­stenka Boulevard, surrounded and sprinkled on all sides by stars
 33393	but distinguished from them all by its nearness to the earth, its white
 33394	light, and its long uplifted tail, shone the enormous and brilliant
 33395	comet of 1812âthe comet which was said to portend all kinds of woes
 33396	and the end of the world. In Pierre, however, that comet with its long
 33397	luminous tail aroused no feeling of fear. On the contrary he gazed
 33398	joyfully, his eyes moist with tears, at this bright comet which, having
 33399	traveled in its orbit with inconceivable velocity through immeasurable
 33400	space, seemed suddenlyâlike an arrow piercing the earthâto remain
 33401	fixed in a chosen spot, vigorously holding its tail erect, shining and
 33402	displaying its white light amid countless other scintillating stars. It
 33403	seemed to Pierre that this comet fully responded to what was passing in
 33404	his own softened and uplifted soul, now blossoming into a new life.

 33416	CHAPTER I
 33417	
 33418	From the close of the year 1811 intensified arming and concentrating of
 33419	the forces of Western Europe began, and in 1812 these forcesâmillions
 33420	of men, reckoning those transporting and feeding the armyâmoved from the
 33421	west eastwards to the Russian frontier, toward which since 1811 Russian
 33422	forces had been similarly drawn. On the twelfth of June, 1812, the
 33423	forces of Western Europe crossed the Russian frontier and war began,
 33424	that is, an event took place opposed to human reason and to human
 33425	nature. Millions of men perpetrated against one another such innumerable
 33426	crimes, frauds, treacheries, thefts, forgeries, issues of false money,
 33427	burglaries, incendiarisms, and murders as in whole centuries are not
 33428	recorded in the annals of all the law courts of the world, but which
 33429	those who committed them did not at the time regard as being crimes.
 33430	
 33431	What produced this extraordinary occurrence? What were its causes? The
 33432	historians tell us with naÃ¯ve assurance that its causes were the wrongs
 33433	inflicted on the Duke of Oldenburg, the nonobservance of the Continental
 33434	System, the ambition of Napoleon, the firmness of Alexander, the
 33435	mistakes of the diplomatists, and so on.
 33436	
 33437	Consequently, it would only have been necessary for Metternich,
 33438	RumyÃ¡ntsev, or Talleyrand, between a levee and an evening party, to have
 33439	taken proper pains and written a more adroit note, or for Napoleon to
 33440	have written to Alexander: âMy respected Brother, I consent to restore
 33441	the duchy to the Duke of Oldenburgââand there would have been no war.
 33442	
 33443	We can understand that the matter seemed like that to contemporaries.
 33444	It naturally seemed to Napoleon that the war was caused by Englandâs
 33445	intrigues (as in fact he said on the island of St. Helena). It naturally
 33446	seemed to members of the English Parliament that the cause of the war
 33447	was Napoleonâs ambition; to the Duke of Oldenburg, that the cause of the
 33448	war was the violence done to him; to businessmen that the cause of the
 33449	war was the Continental System which was ruining Europe; to the generals
 33450	and old soldiers that the chief reason for the war was the necessity of
 33451	giving them employment; to the legitimists of that day that it was the
 33452	need of re-establishing les bons principes, and to the diplomatists of
 33453	that time that it all resulted from the fact that the alliance between
 33454	Russia and Austria in 1809 had not been sufficiently well concealed
 33455	from Napoleon, and from the awkward wording of Memorandum No. 178. It
 33456	is natural that these and a countless and infinite quantity of other
 33457	reasons, the number depending on the endless diversity of points
 33458	of view, presented themselves to the men of that day; but to us, to
 33459	posterity who view the thing that happened in all its magnitude and
 33460	perceive its plain and terrible meaning, these causes seem insufficient.
 33461	To us it is incomprehensible that millions of Christian men killed and
 33462	tortured each other either because Napoleon was ambitious or Alexander
 33463	was firm, or because Englandâs policy was astute or the Duke of
 33464	Oldenburg wronged. We cannot grasp what connection such circumstances
 33465	have with the actual fact of slaughter and violence: why because the
 33466	Duke was wronged, thousands of men from the other side of Europe killed
 33467	and ruined the people of SmolÃ©nsk and Moscow and were killed by them.
 33468	
 33469	To us, their descendants, who are not historians and are not carried
 33470	away by the process of research and can therefore regard the event
 33471	with unclouded common sense, an incalculable number of causes present
 33472	themselves. The deeper we delve in search of these causes the more of
 33473	them we find; and each separate cause or whole series of causes appears
 33474	to us equally valid in itself and equally false by its insignificance
 33475	compared to the magnitude of the events, and by its impotenceâapart
 33476	from the cooperation of all the other coincident causesâto occasion the
 33477	event. To us, the wish or objection of this or that French corporal to
 33478	serve a second term appears as much a cause as Napoleonâs refusal to
 33479	withdraw his troops beyond the Vistula and to restore the duchy of
 33480	Oldenburg; for had he not wished to serve, and had a second, a third,
 33481	and a thousandth corporal and private also refused, there would have
 33482	been so many less men in Napoleonâs army and the war could not have
 33483	occurred.
 33484	
 33485	Had Napoleon not taken offense at the demand that he should withdraw
 33486	beyond the Vistula, and not ordered his troops to advance, there would
 33487	have been no war; but had all his sergeants objected to serving a second
 33488	term then also there could have been no war. Nor could there have been
 33489	a war had there been no English intrigues and no Duke of Oldenburg, and
 33490	had Alexander not felt insulted, and had there not been an autocratic
 33491	government in Russia, or a Revolution in France and a subsequent
 33492	dictatorship and Empire, or all the things that produced the French
 33493	Revolution, and so on. Without each of these causes nothing could have
 33494	happened. So all these causesâmyriads of causesâcoincided to bring it
 33495	about. And so there was no one cause for that occurrence, but it had
 33496	to occur because it had to. Millions of men, renouncing their human
 33497	feelings and reason, had to go from west to east to slay their fellows,
 33498	just as some centuries previously hordes of men had come from the east
 33499	to the west, slaying their fellows.
 33500	
 33501	The actions of Napoleon and Alexander, on whose words the event seemed
 33502	to hang, were as little voluntary as the actions of any soldier who was
 33503	drawn into the campaign by lot or by conscription. This could not be
 33504	otherwise, for in order that the will of Napoleon and Alexander (on whom
 33505	the event seemed to depend) should be carried out, the concurrence of
 33506	innumerable circumstances was needed without anyone of which the event
 33507	could not have taken place. It was necessary that millions of men in
 33508	whose hands lay the real powerâthe soldiers who fired, or transported
 33509	provisions and gunsâshould consent to carry out the will of these weak
 33510	individuals, and should have been induced to do so by an infinite number
 33511	of diverse and complex causes.
 33512	
 33513	We are forced to fall back on fatalism as an explanation of irrational
 33514	events (that is to say, events the reasonableness of which we do
 33515	not understand). The more we try to explain such events in history
 33516	reasonably, the more unreasonable and incomprehensible do they become to
 33517	us.
 33518	
 33519	Each man lives for himself, using his freedom to attain his personal
 33520	aims, and feels with his whole being that he can now do or abstain from
 33521	doing this or that action; but as soon as he has done it, that action
 33522	performed at a certain moment in time becomes irrevocable and belongs to
 33523	history, in which it has not a free but a predestined significance.
 33524	
 33525	There are two sides to the life of every man, his individual life, which
 33526	is the more free the more abstract its interests, and his elemental hive
 33527	life in which he inevitably obeys laws laid down for him.
 33528	
 33529	Man lives consciously for himself, but is an unconscious instrument in
 33530	the attainment of the historic, universal, aims of humanity. A deed done
 33531	is irrevocable, and its result coinciding in time with the actions of
 33532	millions of other men assumes an historic significance. The higher a man
 33533	stands on the social ladder, the more people he is connected with
 33534	and the more power he has over others, the more evident is the
 33535	predestination and inevitability of his every action.
 33536	
 33537	âThe kingâs heart is in the hands of the Lord.â
 33538	
 33539	A king is historyâs slave.
 33540	
 33541	History, that is, the unconscious, general, hive life of mankind, uses
 33542	every moment of the life of kings as a tool for its own purposes.
 33543	
 33544	Though Napoleon at that time, in 1812, was more convinced than ever that
 33545	it depended on him, verser (ou ne pas verser) le sang de ses peuples
 33546	*âas Alexander expressed it in the last letter he wrote himâhe had never
 33547	been so much in the grip of inevitable laws, which compelled him, while
 33548	thinking that he was acting on his own volition, to perform for the hive
 33549	lifeâthat is to say, for historyâwhatever had to be performed.
 33550	
 33551	    * âTo shed (or not to shed) the blood of his peoples.â
 33552	
 33553	
 33554	The people of the west moved eastwards to slay their fellow men, and
 33555	by the law of coincidence thousands of minute causes fitted in and
 33556	co-ordinated to produce that movement and war: reproaches for the
 33557	nonobservance of the Continental System, the Duke of Oldenburgâs
 33558	wrongs, the movement of troops into Prussiaâundertaken (as it seemed to
 33559	Napoleon) only for the purpose of securing an armed peace, the
 33560	French Emperorâs love and habit of war coinciding with his peopleâs
 33561	inclinations, allurement by the grandeur of the preparations, and the
 33562	expenditure on those preparations and the need of obtaining advantages
 33563	to compensate for that expenditure, the intoxicating honors he received
 33564	in Dresden, the diplomatic negotiations which, in the opinion of
 33565	contemporaries, were carried on with a sincere desire to attain peace,
 33566	but which only wounded the self-love of both sides, and millions of
 33567	other causes that adapted themselves to the event that was happening or
 33568	coincided with it.
 33569	
 33570	When an apple has ripened and falls, why does it fall? Because of its
 33571	attraction to the earth, because its stalk withers, because it is dried
 33572	by the sun, because it grows heavier, because the wind shakes it, or
 33573	because the boy standing below wants to eat it?
 33574	
 33575	Nothing is the cause. All this is only the coincidence of conditions in
 33576	which all vital organic and elemental events occur. And the botanist
 33577	who finds that the apple falls because the cellular tissue decays and so
 33578	forth is equally right with the child who stands under the tree and says
 33579	the apple fell because he wanted to eat it and prayed for it. Equally
 33580	right or wrong is he who says that Napoleon went to Moscow because he
 33581	wanted to, and perished because Alexander desired his destruction, and
 33582	he who says that an undermined hill weighing a million tons fell because
 33583	the last navvy struck it for the last time with his mattock. In historic
 33584	events the so-called great men are labels giving names to events, and
 33585	like labels they have but the smallest connection with the event itself.
 33586	
 33587	Every act of theirs, which appears to them an act of their own will, is
 33588	in an historical sense involuntary and is related to the whole course of
 33589	history and predestined from eternity.

 33595	CHAPTER II
 33596	
 33597	On the twenty-ninth of May Napoleon left Dresden, where he had spent
 33598	three weeks surrounded by a court that included princes, dukes, kings,
 33599	and even an emperor. Before leaving, Napoleon showed favor to the
 33600	emperor, kings, and princes who had deserved it, reprimanded the kings
 33601	and princes with whom he was dissatisfied, presented pearls and diamonds
 33602	of his ownâthat is, which he had taken from other kingsâto the Empress
 33603	of Austria, and having, as his historian tells us, tenderly embraced the
 33604	Empress Marie Louiseâwho regarded him as her husband, though he had left
 33605	another wife in Parisâleft her grieved by the parting which she seemed
 33606	hardly able to bear. Though the diplomatists still firmly believed in
 33607	the possibility of peace and worked zealously to that end, and though
 33608	the Emperor Napoleon himself wrote a letter to Alexander, calling him
 33609	Monsieur mon frÃ¨re, and sincerely assured him that he did not want war
 33610	and would always love and honor himâyet he set off to join his army,
 33611	and at every station gave fresh orders to accelerate the movement of his
 33612	troops from west to east. He went in a traveling coach with six horses,
 33613	surrounded by pages, aides-de-camp, and an escort, along the road to
 33614	Posen, Thorn, Danzig, and KÃ¶nigsberg. At each of these towns thousands
 33615	of people met him with excitement and enthusiasm.
 33616	
 33617	The army was moving from west to east, and relays of six horses carried
 33618	him in the same direction. On the tenth of June, * coming up with the
 33619	army, he spent the night in apartments prepared for him on the estate of
 33620	a Polish count in the Vilkavisski forest.
 33621	
 33622	    * Old style.
 33623	
 33624	Next day, overtaking the army, he went in a carriage to the Niemen, and,
 33625	changing into a Polish uniform, he drove to the riverbank in order to
 33626	select a place for the crossing.
 33627	
 33628	Seeing, on the other side, some Cossacks (les Cosaques) and the
 33629	wide-spreading steppes in the midst of which lay the holy city of Moscow
 33630	(Moscou, la ville sainte), the capital of a realm such as the Scythia
 33631	into which Alexander the Great had marchedâNapoleon unexpectedly, and
 33632	contrary alike to strategic and diplomatic considerations, ordered an
 33633	advance, and the next day his army began to cross the Niemen.
 33634	
 33635	Early in the morning of the twelfth of June he came out of his tent,
 33636	which was pitched that day on the steep left bank of the Niemen, and
 33637	looked through a spyglass at the streams of his troops pouring out of
 33638	the Vilkavisski forest and flowing over the three bridges thrown across
 33639	the river. The troops, knowing of the Emperorâs presence, were on the
 33640	lookout for him, and when they caught sight of a figure in an overcoat
 33641	and a cocked hat standing apart from his suite in front of his tent on
 33642	the hill, they threw up their caps and shouted: âVive lâEmpereur!â and
 33643	one after another poured in a ceaseless stream out of the vast forest
 33644	that had concealed them and, separating, flowed on and on by the three
 33645	bridges to the other side.
 33646	
 33647	âNow weâll go into action. Oh, when he takes it in hand himself, things
 33648	get hot... by heaven!... There he is!... Vive lâEmpereur! So these
 33649	are the steppes of Asia! Itâs a nasty country all the same. Au revoir,
 33650	BeauchÃ©; Iâll keep the best palace in Moscow for you! Au revoir. Good
 33651	luck!... Did you see the Emperor? Vive lâEmpereur!... preur!âIf
 33652	they make me Governor of India, GÃ©rard, Iâll make you Minister of
 33653	Kashmirâthatâs settled. Vive lâEmpereur! Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! The
 33654	Cossacksâthose rascalsâsee how they run! Vive lâEmpereur! There he
 33655	is, do you see him? Iâve seen him twice, as I see you now. The little
 33656	corporal... I saw him give the cross to one of the veterans.... Vive
 33657	lâEmpereur!â came the voices of men, old and young, of most diverse
 33658	characters and social positions. On the faces of all was one common
 33659	expression of joy at the commencement of the long-expected campaign and
 33660	of rapture and devotion to the man in the gray coat who was standing on
 33661	the hill.
 33662	
 33663	On the thirteenth of June a rather small, thoroughbred Arab horse was
 33664	brought to Napoleon. He mounted it and rode at a gallop to one of the
 33665	bridges over the Niemen, deafened continually by incessant and rapturous
 33666	acclamations which he evidently endured only because it was impossible
 33667	to forbid the soldiers to express their love of him by such shouting,
 33668	but the shouting which accompanied him everywhere disturbed him and
 33669	distracted him from the military cares that had occupied him from the
 33670	time he joined the army. He rode across one of the swaying pontoon
 33671	bridges to the farther side, turned sharply to the left, and galloped in
 33672	the direction of KÃ³vno, preceded by enraptured, mounted chasseurs of the
 33673	Guard who, breathless with delight, galloped ahead to clear a path for
 33674	him through the troops. On reaching the broad river VÃ­liya, he stopped
 33675	near a regiment of Polish Uhlans stationed by the river.
 33676	
 33677	âVivat!â shouted the Poles, ecstatically, breaking their ranks and
 33678	pressing against one another to see him.
 33679	
 33680	Napoleon looked up and down the river, dismounted, and sat down on a log
 33681	that lay on the bank. At a mute sign from him, a telescope was handed
 33682	him which he rested on the back of a happy page who had run up to him,
 33683	and he gazed at the opposite bank. Then he became absorbed in a map laid
 33684	out on the logs. Without lifting his head he said something, and two of
 33685	his aides-de-camp galloped off to the Polish Uhlans.
 33686	
 33687	âWhat? What did he say?â was heard in the ranks of the Polish Uhlans
 33688	when one of the aides-de-camp rode up to them.
 33689	
 33690	The order was to find a ford and to cross the river. The colonel of the
 33691	Polish Uhlans, a handsome old man, flushed and, fumbling in his speech
 33692	from excitement, asked the aide-de-camp whether he would be permitted
 33693	to swim the river with his Uhlans instead of seeking a ford. In evident
 33694	fear of refusal, like a boy asking for permission to get on a horse, he
 33695	begged to be allowed to swim across the river before the Emperorâs
 33696	eyes. The aide-de-camp replied that probably the Emperor would not be
 33697	displeased at this excess of zeal.
 33698	
 33699	As soon as the aide-de-camp had said this, the old mustached officer,
 33700	with happy face and sparkling eyes, raised his saber, shouted âVivat!â
 33701	and, commanding the Uhlans to follow him, spurred his horse and galloped
 33702	into the river. He gave an angry thrust to his horse, which had grown
 33703	restive under him, and plunged into the water, heading for the deepest
 33704	part where the current was swift. Hundreds of Uhlans galloped in after
 33705	him. It was cold and uncanny in the rapid current in the middle of the
 33706	stream, and the Uhlans caught hold of one another as they fell off their
 33707	horses. Some of the horses were drowned and some of the men; the others
 33708	tried to swim on, some in the saddle and some clinging to their horsesâ
 33709	manes. They tried to make their way forward to the opposite bank and,
 33710	though there was a ford one third of a mile away, were proud that they
 33711	were swimming and drowning in this river under the eyes of the man who
 33712	sat on the log and was not even looking at what they were doing. When
 33713	the aide-de-camp, having returned and choosing an opportune moment,
 33714	ventured to draw the Emperorâs attention to the devotion of the Poles
 33715	to his person, the little man in the gray overcoat got up and, having
 33716	summoned Berthier, began pacing up and down the bank with him, giving
 33717	him instructions and occasionally glancing disapprovingly at the
 33718	drowning Uhlans who distracted his attention.
 33719	
 33720	For him it was no new conviction that his presence in any part of
 33721	the world, from Africa to the steppes of Muscovy alike, was enough to
 33722	dumfound people and impel them to insane self-oblivion. He called for
 33723	his horse and rode to his quarters.
 33724	
 33725	Some forty Uhlans were drowned in the river, though boats were sent to
 33726	their assistance. The majority struggled back to the bank from which
 33727	they had started. The colonel and some of his men got across and with
 33728	difficulty clambered out on the further bank. And as soon as they had
 33729	got out, in their soaked and streaming clothes, they shouted âVivat!â
 33730	and looked ecstatically at the spot where Napoleon had been but where he
 33731	no longer was and at that moment considered themselves happy.
 33732	
 33733	That evening, between issuing one order that the forged Russian paper
 33734	money prepared for use in Russia should be delivered as quickly as
 33735	possible and another that a Saxon should be shot, on whom a letter
 33736	containing information about the orders to the French army had been
 33737	found, Napoleon also gave instructions that the Polish colonel who
 33738	had needlessly plunged into the river should be enrolled in the LÃ©gion
 33739	dâhonneur of which Napoleon was himself the head.
 33740	
 33741	Quos vult perdere dementat. *

 33749	CHAPTER III
 33750	
 33751	The Emperor of Russia had, meanwhile, been in VÃ­lna for more than a
 33752	month, reviewing troops and holding maneuvers. Nothing was ready for the
 33753	war that everyone expected and to prepare for which the Emperor had come
 33754	from Petersburg. There was no general plan of action. The vacillation
 33755	between the various plans that were proposed had even increased after
 33756	the Emperor had been at headquarters for a month. Each of the three
 33757	armies had its own commander in chief, but there was no supreme
 33758	commander of all the forces, and the Emperor did not assume that
 33759	responsibility himself.
 33760	
 33761	The longer the Emperor remained in VÃ­lna the less did everybodyâtired of
 33762	waitingâprepare for the war. All the efforts of those who surrounded the
 33763	sovereign seemed directed merely to making him spend his time pleasantly
 33764	and forget that war was impending.
 33765	
 33766	In June, after many balls and fetes given by the Polish magnates, by the
 33767	courtiers, and by the Emperor himself, it occurred to one of the Polish
 33768	aides-de-camp in attendance that a dinner and ball should be given for
 33769	the Emperor by his aides-de-camp. This idea was eagerly received.
 33770	The Emperor gave his consent. The aides-de-camp collected money by
 33771	subscription. The lady who was thought to be most pleasing to the
 33772	Emperor was invited to act as hostess. Count Bennigsen, being a
 33773	landowner in the VÃ­lna province, offered his country house for the fete,
 33774	and the thirteenth of June was fixed for a ball, dinner, regatta, and
 33775	fireworks at Zakret, Count Bennigsenâs country seat.
 33776	
 33777	The very day that Napoleon issued the order to cross the Niemen, and
 33778	his vanguard, driving off the Cossacks, crossed the Russian frontier,
 33779	Alexander spent the evening at the entertainment given by his
 33780	aides-de-camp at Bennigsenâs country house.
 33781	
 33782	It was a gay and brilliant fete. Connoisseurs of such matters declared
 33783	that rarely had so many beautiful women been assembled in one place.
 33784	Countess BezÃºkhova was present among other Russian ladies who had
 33785	followed the sovereign from Petersburg to VÃ­lna and eclipsed the refined
 33786	Polish ladies by her massive, so-called Russian type of beauty. The
 33787	Emperor noticed her and honored her with a dance.
 33788	
 33789	BorÃ­s DrubetskÃ³y, having left his wife in Moscow and being for the
 33790	present en garÃ§on (as he phrased it), was also there and, though not an
 33791	aide-de-camp, had subscribed a large sum toward the expenses. BorÃ­s
 33792	was now a rich man who had risen to high honors and no longer sought
 33793	patronage but stood on an equal footing with the highest of those of his
 33794	own age. He was meeting HÃ©lÃ¨ne in VÃ­lna after not having seen her for
 33795	a long time and did not recall the past, but as HÃ©lÃ¨ne was enjoying
 33796	the favors of a very important personage and BorÃ­s had only recently
 33797	married, they met as good friends of long standing.
 33798	
 33799	At midnight dancing was still going on. HÃ©lÃ¨ne, not having a suitable
 33800	partner, herself offered to dance the mazurka with BorÃ­s. They were the
 33801	third couple. BorÃ­s, coolly looking at HÃ©lÃ¨neâs dazzling bare shoulders
 33802	which emerged from a dark, gold-embroidered, gauze gown, talked to her
 33803	of old acquaintances and at the same time, unaware of it himself and
 33804	unnoticed by others, never for an instant ceased to observe the Emperor
 33805	who was in the same room. The Emperor was not dancing, he stood in the
 33806	doorway, stopping now one pair and now another with gracious words which
 33807	he alone knew how to utter.
 33808	
 33809	As the mazurka began, BorÃ­s saw that Adjutant General BalashÃ«v, one of
 33810	those in closest attendance on the Emperor, went up to him and contrary
 33811	to court etiquette stood near him while he was talking to a Polish
 33812	lady. Having finished speaking to her, the Emperor looked inquiringly
 33813	at BalashÃ«v and, evidently understanding that he only acted thus because
 33814	there were important reasons for so doing, nodded slightly to the lady
 33815	and turned to him. Hardly had BalashÃ«v begun to speak before a look of
 33816	amazement appeared on the Emperorâs face. He took BalashÃ«v by the arm
 33817	and crossed the room with him, unconsciously clearing a path seven
 33818	yards wide as the people on both sides made way for him. BorÃ­s noticed
 33819	ArakchÃ©evâs excited face when the sovereign went out with BalashÃ«v.
 33820	ArakchÃ©ev looked at the Emperor from under his brow and, sniffing with
 33821	his red nose, stepped forward from the crowd as if expecting the Emperor
 33822	to address him. (BorÃ­s understood that ArakchÃ©ev envied BalashÃ«v and
 33823	was displeased that evidently important news had reached the Emperor
 33824	otherwise than through himself.)
 33825	
 33826	But the Emperor and BalashÃ«v passed out into the illuminated garden
 33827	without noticing ArakchÃ©ev who, holding his sword and glancing
 33828	wrathfully around, followed some twenty paces behind them.
 33829	
 33830	All the time BorÃ­s was going through the figures of the mazurka, he was
 33831	worried by the question of what news BalashÃ«v had brought and how he
 33832	could find it out before others. In the figure in which he had to choose
 33833	two ladies, he whispered to HÃ©lÃ¨ne that he meant to choose Countess
 33834	Potocka who, he thought, had gone out onto the veranda, and glided over
 33835	the parquet to the door opening into the garden, where, seeing BalashÃ«v
 33836	and the Emperor returning to the veranda, he stood still. They were
 33837	moving toward the door. BorÃ­s, fluttering as if he had not had time to
 33838	withdraw, respectfully pressed close to the doorpost with bowed head.
 33839	
 33840	The Emperor, with the agitation of one who has been personally
 33841	affronted, was finishing with these words:
 33842	
 33843	âTo enter Russia without declaring war! I will not make peace as long as
 33844	a single armed enemy remains in my country!â It seemed to BorÃ­s that it
 33845	gave the Emperor pleasure to utter these words. He was satisfied with
 33846	the form in which he had expressed his thoughts, but displeased that
 33847	BorÃ­s had overheard it.
 33848	
 33849	âLet no one know of it!â the Emperor added with a frown.
 33850	
 33851	BorÃ­s understood that this was meant for him and, closing his eyes,
 33852	slightly bowed his head. The Emperor re-entered the ballroom and
 33853	remained there about another half-hour.
 33854	
 33855	BorÃ­s was thus the first to learn the news that the French army had
 33856	crossed the Niemen and, thanks to this, was able to show certain
 33857	important personages that much that was concealed from others was
 33858	usually known to him, and by this means he rose higher in their
 33859	estimation.
 33860	
 33861	
 33862	The unexpected news of the French having crossed the Niemen was
 33863	particularly startling after a month of unfulfilled expectations, and at
 33864	a ball. On first receiving the news, under the influence of indignation
 33865	and resentment the Emperor had found a phrase that pleased him, fully
 33866	expressed his feelings, and has since become famous. On returning home
 33867	at two oâclock that night he sent for his secretary, ShishkÃ³v, and told
 33868	him to write an order to the troops and a rescript to Field Marshal
 33869	Prince SaltykÃ³v, in which he insisted on the words being inserted that
 33870	he would not make peace so long as a single armed Frenchman remained on
 33871	Russian soil.
 33872	
 33873	Next day the following letter was sent to Napoleon:
 33874	
 33875	Monsieur mon frÃ¨re,
 33876	
 33877	Yesterday I learned that, despite the loyalty with which I have kept
 33878	my engagements with Your Majesty, your troops have crossed the Russian
 33879	frontier, and I have this moment received from Petersburg a note, in
 33880	which Count Lauriston informs me, as a reason for this aggression, that
 33881	Your Majesty has considered yourself to be in a state of war with me
 33882	from the time Prince KurÃ¡kin asked for his passports. The reasons on
 33883	which the Duc de Bassano based his refusal to deliver them to him would
 33884	never have led me to suppose that that could serve as a pretext for
 33885	aggression. In fact, the ambassador, as he himself has declared, was
 33886	never authorized to make that demand, and as soon as I was informed of
 33887	it I let him know how much I disapproved of it and ordered him to remain
 33888	at his post. If Your Majesty does not intend to shed the blood of our
 33889	peoples for such a misunderstanding, and consents to withdraw your
 33890	troops from Russian territory, I will regard what has passed as not
 33891	having occurred and an understanding between us will be possible. In
 33892	the contrary case, Your Majesty, I shall see myself forced to repel an
 33893	attack that nothing on my part has provoked. It still depends on Your
 33894	Majesty to preserve humanity from the calamity of another war.
 33895	
 33896	I am, etc.,
 33897	
 33898	(signed) Alexander
 33899	
 33900	
 33901	
 33902	
 33903	
 33904	CHAPTER IV
 33905	
 33906	At two in the morning of the fourteenth of June, the Emperor, having
 33907	sent for BalashÃ«v and read him his letter to Napoleon, ordered him to
 33908	take it and hand it personally to the French Emperor. When dispatching
 33909	BalashÃ«v, the Emperor repeated to him the words that he would not make
 33910	peace so long as a single armed enemy remained on Russian soil and told
 33911	him to transmit those words to Napoleon. Alexander did not insert them
 33912	in his letter to Napoleon, because with his characteristic tact he felt
 33913	it would be injudicious to use them at a moment when a last attempt at
 33914	reconciliation was being made, but he definitely instructed BalashÃ«v to
 33915	repeat them personally to Napoleon.
 33916	
 33917	Having set off in the small hours of the fourteenth, accompanied by a
 33918	bugler and two Cossacks, BalashÃ«v reached the French outposts at the
 33919	village of RykÃ³nty, on the Russian side of the Niemen, by dawn. There he
 33920	was stopped by French cavalry sentinels.
 33921	
 33922	A French noncommissioned officer of hussars, in crimson uniform and a
 33923	shaggy cap, shouted to the approaching BalashÃ«v to halt. BalashÃ«v did
 33924	not do so at once, but continued to advance along the road at a walking
 33925	pace.
 33926	
 33927	The noncommissioned officer frowned and, muttering words of abuse,
 33928	advanced his horseâs chest against BalashÃ«v, put his hand to his saber,
 33929	and shouted rudely at the Russian general, asking: was he deaf that
 33930	he did not do as he was told? BalashÃ«v mentioned who he was. The
 33931	noncommissioned officer began talking with his comrades about regimental
 33932	matters without looking at the Russian general.
 33933	
 33934	After living at the seat of the highest authority and power, after
 33935	conversing with the Emperor less than three hours before, and in general
 33936	being accustomed to the respect due to his rank in the service, BalashÃ«v
 33937	found it very strange here on Russian soil to encounter this hostile,
 33938	and still more this disrespectful, application of brute force to
 33939	himself.
 33940	
 33941	The sun was only just appearing from behind the clouds, the air was
 33942	fresh and dewy. A herd of cattle was being driven along the road from
 33943	the village, and over the fields the larks rose trilling, one after
 33944	another, like bubbles rising in water.
 33945	
 33946	BalashÃ«v looked around him, awaiting the arrival of an officer from the
 33947	village. The Russian Cossacks and bugler and the French hussars looked
 33948	silently at one another from time to time.
 33949	
 33950	A French colonel of hussars, who had evidently just left his bed, came
 33951	riding from the village on a handsome sleek gray horse, accompanied
 33952	by two hussars. The officer, the soldiers, and their horses all looked
 33953	smart and well kept.
 33954	
 33955	It was that first period of a campaign when troops are still in full
 33956	trim, almost like that of peacetime maneuvers, but with a shade of
 33957	martial swagger in their clothes, and a touch of the gaiety and spirit
 33958	of enterprise which always accompany the opening of a campaign.
 33959	
 33960	The French colonel with difficulty repressed a yawn, but was polite and
 33961	evidently understood BalashÃ«vâs importance. He led him past his soldiers
 33962	and behind the outposts and told him that his wish to be presented to
 33963	the Emperor would most likely be satisfied immediately, as the Emperorâs
 33964	quarters were, he believed, not far off.
 33965	
 33966	They rode through the village of RykÃ³nty, past tethered French hussar
 33967	horses, past sentinels and men who saluted their colonel and stared with
 33968	curiosity at a Russian uniform, and came out at the other end of the
 33969	village. The colonel said that the commander of the division was a mile
 33970	and a quarter away and would receive BalashÃ«v and conduct him to his
 33971	destination.
 33972	
 33973	The sun had by now risen and shone gaily on the bright verdure.
 33974	
 33975	They had hardly ridden up a hill, past a tavern, before they saw a group
 33976	of horsemen coming toward them. In front of the group, on a black horse
 33977	with trappings that glittered in the sun, rode a tall man with plumes
 33978	in his hat and black hair curling down to his shoulders. He wore a red
 33979	mantle, and stretched his long legs forward in French fashion. This man
 33980	rode toward BalashÃ«v at a gallop, his plumes flowing and his gems and
 33981	gold lace glittering in the bright June sunshine.
 33982	
 33983	BalashÃ«v was only two horsesâ length from the equestrian with the
 33984	bracelets, plumes, necklaces, and gold embroidery, who was galloping
 33985	toward him with a theatrically solemn countenance, when Julner, the
 33986	French colonel, whispered respectfully: âThe King of Naples!â It was,
 33987	in fact, Murat, now called âKing of Naples.â Though it was quite
 33988	incomprehensible why he should be King of Naples, he was called so,
 33989	and was himself convinced that he was so, and therefore assumed a more
 33990	solemn and important air than formerly. He was so sure that he really
 33991	was the King of Naples that when, on the eve of his departure from that
 33992	city, while walking through the streets with his wife, some Italians
 33993	called out to him: âViva il re!â * he turned to his wife with a pensive
 33994	smile and said: âPoor fellows, they donât know that I am leaving them
 33995	tomorrow!â
 33996	
 33997	    * âLong live the king.â
 33998	
 33999	
 34000	But though he firmly believed himself to be King of Naples and pitied
 34001	the grief felt by the subjects he was abandoning, latterly, after he had
 34002	been ordered to return to military serviceâand especially since his last
 34003	interview with Napoleon in Danzig, when his august brother-in-law had
 34004	told him: âI made you King that you should reign in my way, but not in
 34005	yours!ââhe had cheerfully taken up his familiar business, andâlike a
 34006	well-fed but not overfat horse that feels himself in harness and grows
 34007	skittish between the shaftsâhe dressed up in clothes as variegated and
 34008	expensive as possible, and gaily and contentedly galloped along the
 34009	roads of Poland, without himself knowing why or whither.
 34010	
 34011	On seeing the Russian general he threw back his head, with its long hair
 34012	curling to his shoulders, in a majestically royal manner, and looked
 34013	inquiringly at the French colonel. The colonel respectfully informed His
 34014	Majesty of BalashÃ«vâs mission, whose name he could not pronounce.
 34015	
 34016	âDe Bal-machÃ¨ve!â said the King (overcoming by his assurance the
 34017	difficulty that had presented itself to the colonel). âCharmed to
 34018	make your acquaintance, General!â he added, with a gesture of kingly
 34019	condescension.
 34020	
 34021	As soon as the King began to speak loud and fast his royal dignity
 34022	instantly forsook him, and without noticing it he passed into his
 34023	natural tone of good-natured familiarity. He laid his hand on the
 34024	withers of BalashÃ«vâs horse and said:
 34025	
 34026	âWell, General, it all looks like war,â as if regretting a circumstance
 34027	of which he was unable to judge.
 34028	
 34029	âYour Majesty,â replied BalashÃ«v, âmy master, the Emperor, does not
 34030	desire war and as Your Majesty sees...â said BalashÃ«v, using the words
 34031	Your Majesty at every opportunity, with the affectation unavoidable in
 34032	frequently addressing one to whom the title was still a novelty.
 34033	
 34034	Muratâs face beamed with stupid satisfaction as he listened to âMonsieur
 34035	de Bal-machÃ¨ve.â But royautÃ© oblige! * and he felt it incumbent on
 34036	him, as a king and an ally, to confer on state affairs with Alexanderâs
 34037	envoy. He dismounted, took BalashÃ«vâs arm, and moving a few steps away
 34038	from his suite, which waited respectfully, began to pace up and down
 34039	with him, trying to speak significantly. He referred to the fact that
 34040	the Emperor Napoleon had resented the demand that he should withdraw his
 34041	troops from Prussia, especially when that demand became generally known
 34042	and the dignity of France was thereby offended.
 34043	
 34044	    * âRoyalty has its obligations.â
 34045	
 34046	
 34047	BalashÃ«v replied that there was ânothing offensive in the demand,
 34048	because...â but Murat interrupted him.
 34049	
 34050	âThen you donât consider the Emperor Alexander the aggressor?â he asked
 34051	unexpectedly, with a kindly and foolish smile.
 34052	
 34053	BalashÃ«v told him why he considered Napoleon to be the originator of the
 34054	war.
 34055	
 34056	âOh, my dear general!â Murat again interrupted him, âwith all my heart I
 34057	wish the Emperors may arrange the affair between them, and that the war
 34058	begun by no wish of mine may finish as quickly as possible!â said he,
 34059	in the tone of a servant who wants to remain good friends with another
 34060	despite a quarrel between their masters.
 34061	
 34062	And he went on to inquiries about the Grand Duke and the state of his
 34063	health, and to reminiscences of the gay and amusing times he had spent
 34064	with him in Naples. Then suddenly, as if remembering his royal dignity,
 34065	Murat solemnly drew himself up, assumed the pose in which he had stood
 34066	at his coronation, and, waving his right arm, said:
 34067	
 34068	âI wonât detain you longer, General. I wish success to your mission,â
 34069	and with his embroidered red mantle, his flowing feathers, and his
 34070	glittering ornaments, he rejoined his suite who were respectfully
 34071	awaiting him.
 34072	
 34073	BalashÃ«v rode on, supposing from Muratâs words that he would very soon
 34074	be brought before Napoleon himself. But instead of that, at the next
 34075	village the sentinels of Davoutâs infantry corps detained him as
 34076	the pickets of the vanguard had done, and an adjutant of the corps
 34077	commander, who was fetched, conducted him into the village to Marshal
 34078	Davout.
 34079	
 34080	
 34081	
 34082	
 34083	
 34084	CHAPTER V
 34085	
 34086	Davout was to Napoleon what ArakchÃ©ev was to Alexanderâthough not a
 34087	coward like ArakchÃ©ev, he was as precise, as cruel, and as unable to
 34088	express his devotion to his monarch except by cruelty.
 34089	
 34090	In the organism of states such men are necessary, as wolves are
 34091	necessary in the organism of nature, and they always exist, always
 34092	appear and hold their own, however incongruous their presence and their
 34093	proximity to the head of the government may be. This inevitability alone
 34094	can explain how the cruel ArakchÃ©ev, who tore out a grenadierâs mustache
 34095	with his own hands, whose weak nerves rendered him unable to face
 34096	danger, and who was neither an educated man nor a courtier, was able to
 34097	maintain his powerful position with Alexander, whose own character was
 34098	chivalrous, noble, and gentle.
 34099	
 34100	BalashÃ«v found Davout seated on a barrel in the shed of a peasantâs hut,
 34101	writingâhe was auditing accounts. Better quarters could have been
 34102	found him, but Marshal Davout was one of those men who purposely put
 34103	themselves in most depressing conditions to have a justification for
 34104	being gloomy. For the same reason they are always hard at work and in a
 34105	hurry. âHow can I think of the bright side of life when, as you see, I
 34106	am sitting on a barrel and working in a dirty shed?â the expression of
 34107	his face seemed to say. The chief pleasure and necessity of such men,
 34108	when they encounter anyone who shows animation, is to flaunt their own
 34109	dreary, persistent activity. Davout allowed himself that pleasure when
 34110	BalashÃ«v was brought in. He became still more absorbed in his task when
 34111	the Russian general entered, and after glancing over his spectacles at
 34112	BalashÃ«vâs face, which was animated by the beauty of the morning and
 34113	by his talk with Murat, he did not rise or even stir, but scowled still
 34114	more and sneered malevolently.
 34115	
 34116	When he noticed in BalashÃ«vâs face the disagreeable impression this
 34117	reception produced, Davout raised his head and coldly asked what he
 34118	wanted.
 34119	
 34120	Thinking he could have been received in such a manner only because
 34121	Davout did not know that he was adjutant general to the Emperor
 34122	Alexander and even his envoy to Napoleon, BalashÃ«v hastened to inform
 34123	him of his rank and mission. Contrary to his expectation, Davout, after
 34124	hearing him, became still surlier and ruder.
 34125	
 34126	âWhere is your dispatch?â he inquired. âGive it to me. I will send it to
 34127	the Emperor.â
 34128	
 34129	BalashÃ«v replied that he had been ordered to hand it personally to the
 34130	Emperor.
 34131	
 34132	âYour Emperorâs orders are obeyed in your army, but here,â said Davout,
 34133	âyou must do as youâre told.â
 34134	
 34135	And, as if to make the Russian general still more conscious of his
 34136	dependence on brute force, Davout sent an adjutant to call the officer
 34137	on duty.
 34138	
 34139	BalashÃ«v took out the packet containing the Emperorâs letter and laid it
 34140	on the table (made of a door with its hinges still hanging on it, laid
 34141	across two barrels). Davout took the packet and read the inscription.
 34142	
 34143	âYou are perfectly at liberty to treat me with respect or not,â
 34144	protested BalashÃ«v, âbut permit me to observe that I have the honor to
 34145	be adjutant general to His Majesty....â
 34146	
 34147	Davout glanced at him silently and plainly derived pleasure from the
 34148	signs of agitation and confusion which appeared on BalashÃ«vâs face.
 34149	
 34150	âYou will be treated as is fitting,â said he and, putting the packet in
 34151	his pocket, left the shed.
 34152	
 34153	A minute later the marshalâs adjutant, de CastrÃ¨s, came in and conducted
 34154	BalashÃ«v to the quarters assigned him.
 34155	
 34156	That day he dined with the marshal, at the same board on the barrels.
 34157	
 34158	Next day Davout rode out early and, after asking BalashÃ«v to come to
 34159	him, peremptorily requested him to remain there, to move on with the
 34160	baggage train should orders come for it to move, and to talk to no one
 34161	except Monsieur de CastrÃ¨s.
 34162	
 34163	After four days of solitude, ennui, and consciousness of his impotence
 34164	and insignificanceâparticularly acute by contrast with the sphere of
 34165	power in which he had so lately movedâand after several marches with
 34166	the marshalâs baggage and the French army, which occupied the
 34167	whole district, BalashÃ«v was brought to VÃ­lnaânow occupied by the
 34168	Frenchâthrough the very gate by which he had left it four days
 34169	previously.
 34170	
 34171	Next day the imperial gentleman-in-waiting, the Comte de Turenne, came
 34172	to BalashÃ«v and informed him of the Emperor Napoleonâs wish to honor him
 34173	with an audience.
 34174	
 34175	Four days before, sentinels of the PreobrazhÃ©nsk regiment had stood in
 34176	front of the house to which BalashÃ«v was conducted, and now two French
 34177	grenadiers stood there in blue uniforms unfastened in front and with
 34178	shaggy caps on their heads, and an escort of hussars and Uhlans and a
 34179	brilliant suite of aides-de-camp, pages, and generals, who were waiting
 34180	for Napoleon to come out, were standing at the porch, round his saddle
 34181	horse and his Mameluke, Rustan. Napoleon received BalashÃ«v in the very
 34182	house in VÃ­lna from which Alexander had dispatched him on his mission.
 34183	
 34184	
 34185	
 34186	
 34187	
 34188	CHAPTER VI
 34189	
 34190	Though BalashÃ«v was used to imperial pomp, he was amazed at the luxury
 34191	and magnificence of Napoleonâs court.
 34192	
 34193	The Comte de Turenne showed him into a big reception room where many
 34194	generals, gentlemen-in-waiting, and Polish magnatesâseveral of whom
 34195	BalashÃ«v had seen at the court of the Emperor of Russiaâwere waiting.
 34196	Duroc said that Napoleon would receive the Russian general before going
 34197	for his ride.
 34198	
 34199	After some minutes, the gentleman-in-waiting who was on duty came into
 34200	the great reception room and, bowing politely, asked BalashÃ«v to follow
 34201	him.
 34202	
 34203	BalashÃ«v went into a small reception room, one door of which led into a
 34204	study, the very one from which the Russian Emperor had dispatched him
 34205	on his mission. He stood a minute or two, waiting. He heard hurried
 34206	footsteps beyond the door, both halves of it were opened rapidly; all
 34207	was silent and then from the study the sound was heard of other steps,
 34208	firm and resoluteâthey were those of Napoleon. He had just finished
 34209	dressing for his ride, and wore a blue uniform, opening in front over
 34210	a white waistcoat so long that it covered his rotund stomach, white
 34211	leather breeches tightly fitting the fat thighs of his short legs, and
 34212	Hessian boots. His short hair had evidently just been brushed, but one
 34213	lock hung down in the middle of his broad forehead. His plump white neck
 34214	stood out sharply above the black collar of his uniform, and he smelled
 34215	of Eau de Cologne. His full face, rather young-looking, with its
 34216	prominent chin, wore a gracious and majestic expression of imperial
 34217	welcome.
 34218	
 34219	He entered briskly, with a jerk at every step and his head slightly
 34220	thrown back. His whole short corpulent figure with broad thick
 34221	shoulders, and chest and stomach involuntarily protruding, had that
 34222	imposing and stately appearance one sees in men of forty who live in
 34223	comfort. It was evident, too, that he was in the best of spirits that
 34224	day.
 34225	
 34226	He nodded in answer to BalashÃ«vâs low and respectful bow, and coming up
 34227	to him at once began speaking like a man who values every moment of his
 34228	time and does not condescend to prepare what he has to say but is sure
 34229	he will always say the right thing and say it well.
 34230	
 34231	âGood day, General!â said he. âI have received the letter you brought
 34232	from the Emperor Alexander and am very glad to see you.â He glanced with
 34233	his large eyes into BalashÃ«vâs face and immediately looked past him.
 34234	
 34235	It was plain that BalashÃ«vâs personality did not interest him at all.
 34236	Evidently only what took place within his own mind interested him.
 34237	Nothing outside himself had any significance for him, because everything
 34238	in the world, it seemed to him, depended entirely on his will.
 34239	
 34240	âI do not, and did not, desire war,â he continued, âbut it has been
 34241	forced on me. Even nowâ (he emphasized the word) âI am ready to receive
 34242	any explanations you can give me.â
 34243	
 34244	And he began clearly and concisely to explain his reasons for
 34245	dissatisfaction with the Russian government. Judging by the calmly
 34246	moderate and amicable tone in which the French Emperor spoke, BalashÃ«v
 34247	was firmly persuaded that he wished for peace and intended to enter into
 34248	negotiations.
 34249	
 34250	When Napoleon, having finished speaking, looked inquiringly at the
 34251	Russian envoy, BalashÃ«v began a speech he had prepared long before:
 34252	âSire! The Emperor, my master...â but the sight of the Emperorâs eyes
 34253	bent on him confused him. âYou are flurriedâcompose yourself!â Napoleon
 34254	seemed to say, as with a scarcely perceptible smile he looked at
 34255	BalashÃ«vâs uniform and sword.
 34256	
 34257	BalashÃ«v recovered himself and began to speak. He said that the
 34258	Emperor Alexander did not consider KurÃ¡kinâs demand for his passports a
 34259	sufficient cause for war; that KurÃ¡kin had acted on his own initiative
 34260	and without his sovereignâs assent, that the Emperor Alexander did not
 34261	desire war, and had no relations with England.
 34262	
 34263	âNot yet!â interposed Napoleon, and, as if fearing to give vent to his
 34264	feelings, he frowned and nodded slightly as a sign that BalashÃ«v might
 34265	proceed.
 34266	
 34267	After saying all he had been instructed to say, BalashÃ«v added that
 34268	the Emperor Alexander wished for peace, but would not enter into
 34269	negotiations except on condition that... Here BalashÃ«v hesitated:
 34270	he remembered the words the Emperor Alexander had not written in his
 34271	letter, but had specially inserted in the rescript to SaltykÃ³v and had
 34272	told BalashÃ«v to repeat to Napoleon. BalashÃ«v remembered these words,
 34273	âSo long as a single armed foe remains on Russian soil,â but some
 34274	complex feeling restrained him. He could not utter them, though he
 34275	wished to do so. He grew confused and said: âOn condition that the
 34276	French army retires beyond the Niemen.â
 34277	
 34278	Napoleon noticed BalashÃ«vâs embarrassment when uttering these last
 34279	words; his face twitched and the calf of his left leg began to quiver
 34280	rhythmically. Without moving from where he stood he began speaking in
 34281	a louder tone and more hurriedly than before. During the speech that
 34282	followed, BalashÃ«v, who more than once lowered his eyes, involuntarily
 34283	noticed the quivering of Napoleonâs left leg which increased the more
 34284	Napoleon raised his voice.
 34285	
 34286	âI desire peace, no less than the Emperor Alexander,â he began. âHave
 34287	I not for eighteen months been doing everything to obtain it? I
 34288	have waited eighteen months for explanations. But in order to begin
 34289	negotiations, what is demanded of me?â he said, frowning and making an
 34290	energetic gesture of inquiry with his small white plump hand.
 34291	
 34292	âThe withdrawal of your army beyond the Niemen, sire,â replied BalashÃ«v.
 34293	
 34294	âThe Niemen?â repeated Napoleon. âSo now you want me to retire beyond
 34295	the Niemenâonly the Niemen?â repeated Napoleon, looking straight at
 34296	BalashÃ«v.
 34297	
 34298	The latter bowed his head respectfully.
 34299	
 34300	Instead of the demand of four months earlier to withdraw from Pomerania,
 34301	only a withdrawal beyond the Niemen was now demanded. Napoleon turned
 34302	quickly and began to pace the room.
 34303	
 34304	âYou say the demand now is that I am to withdraw beyond the Niemen
 34305	before commencing negotiations, but in just the same way two months ago
 34306	the demand was that I should withdraw beyond the Vistula and the Oder,
 34307	and yet you are willing to negotiate.â
 34308	
 34309	He went in silence from one corner of the room to the other and again
 34310	stopped in front of BalashÃ«v. BalashÃ«v noticed that his left leg was
 34311	quivering faster than before and his face seemed petrified in its stern
 34312	expression. This quivering of his left leg was a thing Napoleon was
 34313	conscious of. âThe vibration of my left calf is a great sign with me,â
 34314	he remarked at a later date.
 34315	
 34316	âSuch demands as to retreat beyond the Vistula and Oder may be made to a
 34317	Prince of Baden, but not to me!â Napoleon almost screamed, quite to his
 34318	own surprise. âIf you gave me Petersburg and Moscow I could not accept
 34319	such conditions. You say I have begun this war! But who first joined his
 34320	army? The Emperor Alexander, not I! And you offer me negotiations when I
 34321	have expended millions, when you are in alliance with England, and when
 34322	your position is a bad one. You offer me negotiations! But what is the
 34323	aim of your alliance with England? What has she given you?â he continued
 34324	hurriedly, evidently no longer trying to show the advantages of peace
 34325	and discuss its possibility, but only to prove his own rectitude and
 34326	power and Alexanderâs errors and duplicity.
 34327	
 34328	The commencement of his speech had obviously been made with the
 34329	intention of demonstrating the advantages of his position and showing
 34330	that he was nevertheless willing to negotiate. But he had begun talking,
 34331	and the more he talked the less could he control his words.
 34332	
 34333	The whole purport of his remarks now was evidently to exalt himself and
 34334	insult Alexanderâjust what he had least desired at the commencement of
 34335	the interview.
 34336	
 34337	âI hear you have made peace with Turkey?â
 34338	
 34339	BalashÃ«v bowed his head affirmatively.
 34340	
 34341	âPeace has been concluded...â he began.
 34342	
 34343	But Napoleon did not let him speak. He evidently wanted to do all the
 34344	talking himself, and continued to talk with the sort of eloquence and
 34345	unrestrained irritability to which spoiled people are so prone.
 34346	
 34347	âYes, I know you have made peace with the Turks without obtaining
 34348	Moldavia and Wallachia; I would have given your sovereign those
 34349	provinces as I gave him Finland. Yes,â he went on, âI promised and would
 34350	have given the Emperor Alexander Moldavia and Wallachia, and now he
 34351	wonât have those splendid provinces. Yet he might have united them to
 34352	his empire and in a single reign would have extended Russia from the
 34353	Gulf of Bothnia to the mouths of the Danube. Catherine the Great could
 34354	not have done more,â said Napoleon, growing more and more excited as he
 34355	paced up and down the room, repeating to BalashÃ«v almost the very words
 34356	he had used to Alexander himself at Tilsit. âAll that, he would have
 34357	owed to my friendship. Oh, what a splendid reign!â he repeated several
 34358	times, then paused, drew from his pocket a gold snuffbox, lifted it to
 34359	his nose, and greedily sniffed at it.
 34360	
 34361	âWhat a splendid reign the Emperor Alexanderâs might have been!â
 34362	
 34363	He looked compassionately at BalashÃ«v, and as soon as the latter tried
 34364	to make some rejoinder hastily interrupted him.
 34365	
 34366	âWhat could he wish or look for that he would not have obtained
 34367	through my friendship?â demanded Napoleon, shrugging his shoulders
 34368	in perplexity. âBut no, he has preferred to surround himself with
 34369	my enemies, and with whom? With Steins, Armfeldts, Bennigsens, and
 34370	Wintzingerodes! Stein, a traitor expelled from his own country;
 34371	Armfeldt, a rake and an intriguer; Wintzingerode, a fugitive French
 34372	subject; Bennigsen, rather more of a soldier than the others, but all
 34373	the same an incompetent who was unable to do anything in 1807 and who
 34374	should awaken terrible memories in the Emperor Alexanderâs mind....
 34375	Granted that were they competent they might be made use of,â continued
 34376	Napoleonâhardly able to keep pace in words with the rush of thoughts
 34377	that incessantly sprang up, proving how right and strong he was (in his
 34378	perception the two were one and the same)ââbut they are not even that!
 34379	They are neither fit for war nor peace! Barclay is said to be the
 34380	most capable of them all, but I cannot say so, judging by his first
 34381	movements. And what are they doing, all these courtiers? Pfuel proposes,
 34382	Armfeldt disputes, Bennigsen considers, and Barclay, called on to act,
 34383	does not know what to decide on, and time passes bringing no result.
 34384	BagratiÃ³n alone is a military man. Heâs stupid, but he has experience,
 34385	a quick eye, and resolution.... And what role is your young monarch
 34386	playing in that monstrous crowd? They compromise him and throw on him
 34387	the responsibility for all that happens. A sovereign should not be with
 34388	the army unless he is a general!â said Napoleon, evidently uttering
 34389	these words as a direct challenge to the Emperor. He knew how Alexander
 34390	desired to be a military commander.
 34391	
 34392	âThe campaign began only a week ago, and you havenât even been able to
 34393	defend VÃ­lna. You are cut in two and have been driven out of the Polish
 34394	provinces. Your army is grumbling.â
 34395	
 34396	âOn the contrary, Your Majesty,â said BalashÃ«v, hardly able to remember
 34397	what had been said to him and following these verbal fireworks with
 34398	difficulty, âthe troops are burning with eagerness...â
 34399	
 34400	âI know everything!â Napoleon interrupted him. âI know everything. I
 34401	know the number of your battalions as exactly as I know my own. You have
 34402	not two hundred thousand men, and I have three times that number. I give
 34403	you my word of honor,â said Napoleon, forgetting that his word of honor
 34404	could carry no weightââI give you my word of honor that I have five
 34405	hundred and thirty thousand men this side of the Vistula. The Turks will
 34406	be of no use to you; they are worth nothing and have shown it by making
 34407	peace with you. As for the Swedesâit is their fate to be governed by
 34408	mad kings. Their king was insane and they changed him for
 34409	anotherâBernadotte, who promptly went madâfor no Swede would ally
 34410	himself with Russia unless he were mad.â
 34411	
 34412	Napoleon grinned maliciously and again raised his snuffbox to his nose.
 34413	
 34414	BalashÃ«v knew how to reply to each of Napoleonâs remarks, and would
 34415	have done so; he continually made the gesture of a man wishing to say
 34416	something, but Napoleon always interrupted him. To the alleged insanity
 34417	of the Swedes, BalashÃ«v wished to reply that when Russia is on her side
 34418	Sweden is practically an island: but Napoleon gave an angry exclamation
 34419	to drown his voice. Napoleon was in that state of irritability in which
 34420	a man has to talk, talk, and talk, merely to convince himself that he is
 34421	in the right. BalashÃ«v began to feel uncomfortable: as envoy he feared
 34422	to demean his dignity and felt the necessity of replying; but, as a man,
 34423	he shrank before the transport of groundless wrath that had evidently
 34424	seized Napoleon. He knew that none of the words now uttered by Napoleon
 34425	had any significance, and that Napoleon himself would be ashamed of them
 34426	when he came to his senses. BalashÃ«v stood with downcast eyes, looking
 34427	at the movements of Napoleonâs stout legs and trying to avoid meeting
 34428	his eyes.
 34429	
 34430	âBut what do I care about your allies?â said Napoleon. âI have
 34431	alliesâthe Poles. There are eighty thousand of them and they fight like
 34432	lions. And there will be two hundred thousand of them.â
 34433	
 34434	And probably still more perturbed by the fact that he had uttered this
 34435	obvious falsehood, and that BalashÃ«v still stood silently before him in
 34436	the same attitude of submission to fate, Napoleon abruptly turned
 34437	round, drew close to BalashÃ«vâs face, and, gesticulating rapidly and
 34438	energetically with his white hands, almost shouted:
 34439	
 34440	âKnow that if you stir up Prussia against me, Iâll wipe it off the map
 34441	of Europe!â he declared, his face pale and distorted by anger, and he
 34442	struck one of his small hands energetically with the other. âYes, I
 34443	will throw you back beyond the DvÃ­na and beyond the Dnieper, and will
 34444	re-erect against you that barrier which it was criminal and blind of
 34445	Europe to allow to be destroyed. Yes, that is what will happen to you.
 34446	That is what you have gained by alienating me!â And he walked silently
 34447	several times up and down the room, his fat shoulders twitching.
 34448	
 34449	He put his snuffbox into his waistcoat pocket, took it out again, lifted
 34450	it several times to his nose, and stopped in front of BalashÃ«v. He
 34451	paused, looked ironically straight into BalashÃ«vâs eyes, and said in a
 34452	quiet voice:
 34453	
 34454	âAnd yet what a splendid reign your master might have had!â
 34455	
 34456	BalashÃ«v, feeling it incumbent on him to reply, said that from the
 34457	Russian side things did not appear in so gloomy a light. Napoleon was
 34458	silent, still looking derisively at him and evidently not listening to
 34459	him. BalashÃ«v said that in Russia the best results were expected from
 34460	the war. Napoleon nodded condescendingly, as if to say, âI know itâs
 34461	your duty to say that, but you donât believe it yourself. I have
 34462	convinced you.â
 34463	
 34464	When BalashÃ«v had ended, Napoleon again took out his snuffbox, sniffed
 34465	at it, and stamped his foot twice on the floor as a signal. The door
 34466	opened, a gentleman-in-waiting, bending respectfully, handed the Emperor
 34467	his hat and gloves; another brought him a pocket handkerchief. Napoleon,
 34468	without giving them a glance, turned to BalashÃ«v:
 34469	
 34470	âAssure the Emperor Alexander from me,â said he, taking his hat, âthat
 34471	I am as devoted to him as before: I know him thoroughly and very highly
 34472	esteem his lofty qualities. I will detain you no longer, General; you
 34473	shall receive my letter to the Emperor.â
 34474	
 34475	And Napoleon went quickly to the door. Everyone in the reception room
 34476	rushed forward and descended the staircase.
 34477	
 34478	
 34479	
 34480	
 34481	
 34482	CHAPTER VII
 34483	
 34484	After all that Napoleon had said to himâthose bursts of anger and the
 34485	last dryly spoken words: âI will detain you no longer, General; you
 34486	shall receive my letter,â BalashÃ«v felt convinced that Napoleon would
 34487	not wish to see him, and would even avoid another meeting with himâan
 34488	insulted envoyâespecially as he had witnessed his unseemly anger. But,
 34489	to his surprise, BalashÃ«v received, through Duroc, an invitation to dine
 34490	with the Emperor that day.
 34491	
 34492	BessiÃ¨res, Caulaincourt, and Berthier were present at that dinner.
 34493	
 34494	Napoleon met BalashÃ«v cheerfully and amiably. He not only showed no sign
 34495	of constraint or self-reproach on account of his outburst that morning,
 34496	but, on the contrary, tried to reassure BalashÃ«v. It was evident that
 34497	he had long been convinced that it was impossible for him to make a
 34498	mistake, and that in his perception whatever he did was right, not
 34499	because it harmonized with any idea of right and wrong, but because he
 34500	did it.
 34501	
 34502	The Emperor was in very good spirits after his ride through VÃ­lna, where
 34503	crowds of people had rapturously greeted and followed him. From all
 34504	the windows of the streets through which he rode, rugs, flags, and his
 34505	monogram were displayed, and the Polish ladies, welcoming him, waved
 34506	their handkerchiefs to him.
 34507	
 34508	At dinner, having placed BalashÃ«v beside him, Napoleon not only treated
 34509	him amiably but behaved as if BalashÃ«v were one of his own courtiers,
 34510	one of those who sympathized with his plans and ought to rejoice at
 34511	his success. In the course of conversation he mentioned Moscow and
 34512	questioned BalashÃ«v about the Russian capital, not merely as an
 34513	interested traveler asks about a new city he intends to visit, but as
 34514	if convinced that BalashÃ«v, as a Russian, must be flattered by his
 34515	curiosity.
 34516	
 34517	âHow many inhabitants are there in Moscow? How many houses? Is it true
 34518	that Moscow is called âHoly Moscowâ? How many churches are there in
 34519	Moscow?â he asked.
 34520	
 34521	And receiving the reply that there were more than two hundred churches,
 34522	he remarked:
 34523	
 34524	âWhy such a quantity of churches?â
 34525	
 34526	âThe Russians are very devout,â replied BalashÃ«v.
 34527	
 34528	âBut a large number of monasteries and churches is always a sign of the
 34529	backwardness of a people,â said Napoleon, turning to Caulaincourt for
 34530	appreciation of this remark.
 34531	
 34532	BalashÃ«v respectfully ventured to disagree with the French Emperor.
 34533	
 34534	âEvery country has its own character,â said he.
 34535	
 34536	âBut nowhere in Europe is there anything like that,â said Napoleon.
 34537	
 34538	âI beg your Majestyâs pardon,â returned BalashÃ«v, âbesides Russia there
 34539	is Spain, where there are also many churches and monasteries.â
 34540	
 34541	This reply of BalashÃ«vâs, which hinted at the recent defeats of the
 34542	French in Spain, was much appreciated when he related it at Alexanderâs
 34543	court, but it was not much appreciated at Napoleonâs dinner, where it
 34544	passed unnoticed.
 34545	
 34546	The uninterested and perplexed faces of the marshals showed that they
 34547	were puzzled as to what BalashÃ«vâs tone suggested. âIf there is a point
 34548	we donât see it, or it is not at all witty,â their expressions seemed
 34549	to say. So little was his rejoinder appreciated that Napoleon did not
 34550	notice it at all and naÃ¯vely asked BalashÃ«v through what towns the
 34551	direct road from there to Moscow passed. BalashÃ«v, who was on the alert
 34552	all through the dinner, replied that just as âall roads lead to Rome,â
 34553	so all roads lead to Moscow: there were many roads, and âamong them the
 34554	road through PoltÃ¡va, which Charles XII chose.â BalashÃ«v involuntarily
 34555	flushed with pleasure at the aptitude of this reply, but hardly had
 34556	he uttered the word PoltÃ¡va before Caulaincourt began speaking of the
 34557	badness of the road from Petersburg to Moscow and of his Petersburg
 34558	reminiscences.
 34559	
 34560	After dinner they went to drink coffee in Napoleonâs study, which four
 34561	days previously had been that of the Emperor Alexander. Napoleon sat
 34562	down, toying with his SÃ¨vres coffee cup, and motioned BalashÃ«v to a
 34563	chair beside him.
 34564	
 34565	Napoleon was in that well-known after-dinner mood which, more than
 34566	any reasoned cause, makes a man contented with himself and disposed to
 34567	consider everyone his friend. It seemed to him that he was surrounded
 34568	by men who adored him: and he felt convinced that, after his dinner,
 34569	BalashÃ«v too was his friend and worshiper. Napoleon turned to him with a
 34570	pleasant, though slightly ironic, smile.
 34571	
 34572	âThey tell me this is the room the Emperor Alexander occupied? Strange,
 34573	isnât it, General?â he said, evidently not doubting that this remark
 34574	would be agreeable to his hearer since it went to prove his, Napoleonâs,
 34575	superiority to Alexander.
 34576	
 34577	BalashÃ«v made no reply and bowed his head in silence.
 34578	
 34579	âYes. Four days ago in this room, Wintzingerode and Stein were
 34580	deliberating,â continued Napoleon with the same derisive and
 34581	self-confident smile. âWhat I canât understand,â he went on, âis that
 34582	the Emperor Alexander has surrounded himself with my personal enemies.
 34583	That I do not... understand. Has he not thought that I may do the same?â
 34584	and he turned inquiringly to BalashÃ«v, and evidently this thought turned
 34585	him back on to the track of his morningâs anger, which was still fresh
 34586	in him.
 34587	
 34588	âAnd let him know that I will do so!â said Napoleon, rising and pushing
 34589	his cup away with his hand. âIâll drive all his WÃ¼rttemberg, Baden, and
 34590	Weimar relations out of Germany.... Yes. Iâll drive them out. Let him
 34591	prepare an asylum for them in Russia!â
 34592	
 34593	BalashÃ«v bowed his head with an air indicating that he would like to
 34594	make his bow and leave, and only listened because he could not help
 34595	hearing what was said to him. Napoleon did not notice this expression;
 34596	he treated BalashÃ«v not as an envoy from his enemy, but as a man
 34597	now fully devoted to him and who must rejoice at his former masterâs
 34598	humiliation.
 34599	
 34600	âAnd why has the Emperor Alexander taken command of the armies? What is
 34601	the good of that? War is my profession, but his business is to reign
 34602	and not to command armies! Why has he taken on himself such a
 34603	responsibility?â
 34604	
 34605	Again Napoleon brought out his snuffbox, paced several times up and down
 34606	the room in silence, and then, suddenly and unexpectedly, went up to
 34607	BalashÃ«v and with a slight smile, as confidently, quickly, and simply
 34608	as if he were doing something not merely important but pleasing to
 34609	BalashÃ«v, he raised his hand to the forty-year-old Russian generalâs
 34610	face and, taking him by the ear, pulled it gently, smiling with his lips
 34611	only.
 34612	
 34613	To have oneâs ear pulled by the Emperor was considered the greatest
 34614	honor and mark of favor at the French court.
 34615	
 34616	âWell, adorer and courtier of the Emperor Alexander, why donât you say
 34617	anything?â said he, as if it was ridiculous, in his presence, to be the
 34618	adorer and courtier of anyone but himself, Napoleon. âAre the horses
 34619	ready for the general?â he added, with a slight inclination of his head
 34620	in reply to BalashÃ«vâs bow. âLet him have mine, he has a long way to
 34621	go!â
 34622	
 34623	The letter taken by BalashÃ«v was the last Napoleon sent to Alexander.
 34624	Every detail of the interview was communicated to the Russian monarch,
 34625	and the war began....

 34631	CHAPTER VIII
 34632	
 34633	After his interview with Pierre in Moscow, Prince Andrew went to
 34634	Petersburg, on business as he told his family, but really to meet
 34635	Anatole KurÃ¡gin whom he felt it necessary to encounter. On reaching
 34636	Petersburg he inquired for KurÃ¡gin but the latter had already left the
 34637	city. Pierre had warned his brother-in-law that Prince Andrew was on
 34638	his track. Anatole KurÃ¡gin promptly obtained an appointment from
 34639	the Minister of War and went to join the army in Moldavia. While in
 34640	Petersburg Prince Andrew met KutÃºzov, his former commander who was
 34641	always well disposed toward him, and KutÃºzov suggested that he should
 34642	accompany him to the army in Moldavia, to which the old general had
 34643	been appointed commander in chief. So Prince Andrew, having received an
 34644	appointment on the headquarters staff, left for Turkey.
 34645	
 34646	Prince Andrew did not think it proper to write and challenge KurÃ¡gin.
 34647	He thought that if he challenged him without some fresh cause it might
 34648	compromise the young Countess RostÃ³va and so he wanted to meet KurÃ¡gin
 34649	personally in order to find a fresh pretext for a duel. But he again
 34650	failed to meet KurÃ¡gin in Turkey, for soon after Prince Andrew arrived,
 34651	the latter returned to Russia. In a new country, amid new conditions,
 34652	Prince Andrew found life easier to bear. After his betrothed had broken
 34653	faith with himâwhich he felt the more acutely the more he tried to
 34654	conceal its effectsâthe surroundings in which he had been happy became
 34655	trying to him, and the freedom and independence he had once prized
 34656	so highly were still more so. Not only could he no longer think the
 34657	thoughts that had first come to him as he lay gazing at the sky on the
 34658	field of Austerlitz and had later enlarged upon with Pierre, and which
 34659	had filled his solitude at BoguchÃ¡rovo and then in Switzerland and Rome,
 34660	but he even dreaded to recall them and the bright and boundless horizons
 34661	they had revealed. He was now concerned only with the nearest practical
 34662	matters unrelated to his past interests, and he seized on these the more
 34663	eagerly the more those past interests were closed to him. It was as if
 34664	that lofty, infinite canopy of heaven that had once towered above him
 34665	had suddenly turned into a low, solid vault that weighed him down, in
 34666	which all was clear, but nothing eternal or mysterious.
 34667	
 34668	Of the activities that presented themselves to him, army service was the
 34669	simplest and most familiar. As a general on duty on KutÃºzovâs staff,
 34670	he applied himself to business with zeal and perseverance and surprised
 34671	KutÃºzov by his willingness and accuracy in work. Not having found
 34672	KurÃ¡gin in Turkey, Prince Andrew did not think it necessary to rush back
 34673	to Russia after him, but all the same he knew that however long it might
 34674	be before he met KurÃ¡gin, despite his contempt for him and despite all
 34675	the proofs he deduced to convince himself that it was not worth stooping
 34676	to a conflict with himâhe knew that when he did meet him he would not
 34677	be able to resist calling him out, any more than a ravenous man can help
 34678	snatching at food. And the consciousness that the insult was not yet
 34679	avenged, that his rancor was still unspent, weighed on his heart and
 34680	poisoned the artificial tranquillity which he managed to obtain in
 34681	Turkey by means of restless, plodding, and rather vainglorious and
 34682	ambitious activity.
 34683	
 34684	In the year 1812, when news of the war with Napoleon reached
 34685	Bucharestâwhere KutÃºzov had been living for two months, passing his
 34686	days and nights with a Wallachian womanâPrince Andrew asked KutÃºzov
 34687	to transfer him to the Western Army. KutÃºzov, who was already weary of
 34688	BolkÃ³nskiâs activity which seemed to reproach his own idleness, very
 34689	readily let him go and gave him a mission to Barclay de Tolly.
 34690	
 34691	Before joining the Western Army which was then, in May, encamped at
 34692	Drissa, Prince Andrew visited Bald Hills which was directly on his way,
 34693	being only two miles off the SmolÃ©nsk highroad. During the last three
 34694	years there had been so many changes in his life, he had thought, felt,
 34695	and seen so much (having traveled both in the east and the west), that
 34696	on reaching Bald Hills it struck him as strange and unexpected to find
 34697	the way of life there unchanged and still the same in every detail.
 34698	He entered through the gates with their stone pillars and drove up
 34699	the avenue leading to the house as if he were entering an enchanted,
 34700	sleeping castle. The same old stateliness, the same cleanliness, the
 34701	same stillness reigned there, and inside there was the same furniture,
 34702	the same walls, sounds, and smell, and the same timid faces, only
 34703	somewhat older. Princess Mary was still the same timid, plain maiden
 34704	getting on in years, uselessly and joylessly passing the best years of
 34705	her life in fear and constant suffering. Mademoiselle Bourienne was
 34706	the same coquettish, self-satisfied girl, enjoying every moment of her
 34707	existence and full of joyous hopes for the future. She had merely become
 34708	more self-confident, Prince Andrew thought. Dessalles, the tutor he had
 34709	brought from Switzerland, was wearing a coat of Russian cut and
 34710	talking broken Russian to the servants, but was still the same narrowly
 34711	intelligent, conscientious, and pedantic preceptor. The old prince
 34712	had changed in appearance only by the loss of a tooth, which left a
 34713	noticeable gap on one side of his mouth; in character he was the same as
 34714	ever, only showing still more irritability and skepticism as to what was
 34715	happening in the world. Little Nicholas alone had changed. He had grown,
 34716	become rosier, had curly dark hair, and, when merry and laughing, quite
 34717	unconsciously lifted the upper lip of his pretty little mouth just
 34718	as the little princess used to do. He alone did not obey the law of
 34719	immutability in the enchanted, sleeping castle. But though externally
 34720	all remained as of old, the inner relations of all these people had
 34721	changed since Prince Andrew had seen them last. The household was
 34722	divided into two alien and hostile camps, who changed their habits for
 34723	his sake and only met because he was there. To the one camp belonged
 34724	the old prince, Mademoiselle Bourienne, and the architect; to the other
 34725	Princess Mary, Dessalles, little Nicholas, and all the old nurses and
 34726	maids.
 34727	
 34728	During his stay at Bald Hills all the family dined together, but they
 34729	were ill at ease and Prince Andrew felt that he was a visitor for whose
 34730	sake an exception was being made and that his presence made them all
 34731	feel awkward. Involuntarily feeling this at dinner on the first day, he
 34732	was taciturn, and the old prince noticing this also became morosely dumb
 34733	and retired to his apartments directly after dinner. In the evening,
 34734	when Prince Andrew went to him and, trying to rouse him, began to
 34735	tell him of the young Count KÃ¡menskyâs campaign, the old prince
 34736	began unexpectedly to talk about Princess Mary, blaming her for her
 34737	superstitions and her dislike of Mademoiselle Bourienne, who, he said,
 34738	was the only person really attached to him.
 34739	
 34740	The old prince said that if he was ill it was only because of Princess
 34741	Mary: that she purposely worried and irritated him, and that by
 34742	indulgence and silly talk she was spoiling little Prince Nicholas. The
 34743	old prince knew very well that he tormented his daughter and that her
 34744	life was very hard, but he also knew that he could not help tormenting
 34745	her and that she deserved it. âWhy does Prince Andrew, who sees this,
 34746	say nothing to me about his sister? Does he think me a scoundrel, or an
 34747	old fool who, without any reason, keeps his own daughter at a distance
 34748	and attaches this Frenchwoman to himself? He doesnât understand, so I
 34749	must explain it, and he must hear me out,â thought the old prince.
 34750	And he began explaining why he could not put up with his daughterâs
 34751	unreasonable character.
 34752	
 34753	âIf you ask me,â said Prince Andrew, without looking up (he was
 34754	censuring his father for the first time in his life), âI did not wish to
 34755	speak about it, but as you ask me I will give you my frank opinion. If
 34756	there is any misunderstanding and discord between you and Mary, I canât
 34757	blame her for it at all. I know how she loves and respects you. Since
 34758	you ask me,â continued Prince Andrew, becoming irritableâas he was
 34759	always liable to do of lateââI can only say that if there are any
 34760	misunderstandings they are caused by that worthless woman, who is not
 34761	fit to be my sisterâs companion.â
 34762	
 34763	The old man at first stared fixedly at his son, and an unnatural smile
 34764	disclosed the fresh gap between his teeth to which Prince Andrew could
 34765	not get accustomed.
 34766	
 34767	âWhat companion, my dear boy? Eh? Youâve already been talking it over!
 34768	Eh?â
 34769	
 34770	âFather, I did not want to judge,â said Prince Andrew, in a hard and
 34771	bitter tone, âbut you challenged me, and I have said, and always shall
 34772	say, that Mary is not to blame, but those to blameâthe one to blameâis
 34773	that Frenchwoman.â
 34774	
 34775	âAh, he has passed judgment... passed judgement!â said the old man in a
 34776	low voice and, as it seemed to Prince Andrew, with some embarrassment,
 34777	but then he suddenly jumped up and cried: âBe off, be off! Let not a
 34778	trace of you remain here!...â
 34779	
 34780	
 34781	Prince Andrew wished to leave at once, but Princess Mary persuaded him
 34782	to stay another day. That day he did not see his father, who did not
 34783	leave his room and admitted no one but Mademoiselle Bourienne and
 34784	TÃ­khon, but asked several times whether his son had gone. Next day,
 34785	before leaving, Prince Andrew went to his sonâs rooms. The boy,
 34786	curly-headed like his mother and glowing with health, sat on his knee,
 34787	and Prince Andrew began telling him the story of Bluebeard, but fell
 34788	into a reverie without finishing the story. He thought not of this
 34789	pretty child, his son whom he held on his knee, but of himself. He
 34790	sought in himself either remorse for having angered his father or regret
 34791	at leaving home for the first time in his life on bad terms with him,
 34792	and was horrified to find neither. What meant still more to him was that
 34793	he sought and did not find in himself the former tenderness for his son
 34794	which he had hoped to reawaken by caressing the boy and taking him on
 34795	his knee.
 34796	
 34797	âWell, go on!â said his son.
 34798	
 34799	Prince Andrew, without replying, put him down from his knee and went out
 34800	of the room.
 34801	
 34802	As soon as Prince Andrew had given up his daily occupations, and
 34803	especially on returning to the old conditions of life amid which he had
 34804	been happy, weariness of life overcame him with its former intensity,
 34805	and he hastened to escape from these memories and to find some work as
 34806	soon as possible.
 34807	
 34808	âSo youâve decided to go, Andrew?â asked his sister.
 34809	
 34810	âThank God that I can,â replied Prince Andrew. âI am very sorry you
 34811	canât.â
 34812	
 34813	âWhy do you say that?â replied Princess Mary. âWhy do you say that,
 34814	when you are going to this terrible war, and he is so old? Mademoiselle
 34815	Bourienne says he has been asking about you....â
 34816	
 34817	As soon as she began to speak of that, her lips trembled and her tears
 34818	began to fall. Prince Andrew turned away and began pacing the room.
 34819	
 34820	âAh, my God! my God! When one thinks who and whatâwhat trashâcan cause
 34821	people misery!â he said with a malignity that alarmed Princess Mary.
 34822	
 34823	She understood that when speaking of âtrashâ he referred not only to
 34824	Mademoiselle Bourienne, the cause of her misery, but also to the man who
 34825	had ruined his own happiness.
 34826	
 34827	âAndrew! One thing I beg, I entreat of you!â she said, touching his
 34828	elbow and looking at him with eyes that shone through her tears. âI
 34829	understand youâ (she looked down). âDonât imagine that sorrow is the
 34830	work of men. Men are His tools.â She looked a little above Prince
 34831	Andrewâs head with the confident, accustomed look with which one looks
 34832	at the place where a familiar portrait hangs. âSorrow is sent by Him,
 34833	not by men. Men are His instruments, they are not to blame. If you think
 34834	someone has wronged you, forget it and forgive! We have no right to
 34835	punish. And then you will know the happiness of forgiving.â
 34836	
 34837	âIf I were a woman I would do so, Mary. That is a womanâs virtue. But
 34838	a man should not and cannot forgive and forget,â he replied, and though
 34839	till that moment he had not been thinking of KurÃ¡gin, all his unexpended
 34840	anger suddenly swelled up in his heart.
 34841	
 34842	âIf Mary is already persuading me to forgive, it means that I ought long
 34843	ago to have punished him,â he thought. And giving her no further reply,
 34844	he began thinking of the glad vindictive moment when he would meet
 34845	KurÃ¡gin who he knew was now in the army.
 34846	
 34847	Princess Mary begged him to stay one day more, saying that she knew how
 34848	unhappy her father would be if Andrew left without being reconciled to
 34849	him, but Prince Andrew replied that he would probably soon be back again
 34850	from the army and would certainly write to his father, but that the
 34851	longer he stayed now the more embittered their differences would become.
 34852	
 34853	âGood-by, Andrew! Remember that misfortunes come from God, and men are
 34854	never to blame,â were the last words he heard from his sister when he
 34855	took leave of her.
 34856	
 34857	âThen it must be so!â thought Prince Andrew as he drove out of the
 34858	avenue from the house at Bald Hills. âShe, poor innocent creature, is
 34859	left to be victimized by an old man who has outlived his wits. The old
 34860	man feels he is guilty, but cannot change himself. My boy is growing up
 34861	and rejoices in life, in which like everybody else he will deceive or be
 34862	deceived. And I am off to the army. Why? I myself donât know. I want
 34863	to meet that man whom I despise, so as to give him a chance to kill and
 34864	laugh at me!â
 34865	
 34866	These conditions of life had been the same before, but then they were
 34867	all connected, while now they had all tumbled to pieces. Only senseless
 34868	things, lacking coherence, presented themselves one after another to
 34869	Prince Andrewâs mind.
 34870	
 34871	
 34872	
 34873	
 34874	
 34875	CHAPTER IX
 34876	
 34877	Prince Andrew reached the general headquarters of the army at the end of
 34878	June. The first army, with which was the Emperor, occupied the fortified
 34879	camp at Drissa; the second army was retreating, trying to effect a
 34880	junction with the first one from which it was said to be cut off by
 34881	large French forces. Everyone was dissatisfied with the general course
 34882	of affairs in the Russian army, but no one anticipated any danger of
 34883	invasion of the Russian provinces, and no one thought the war would
 34884	extend farther than the western, the Polish, provinces.
 34885	
 34886	Prince Andrew found Barclay de Tolly, to whom he had been assigned, on
 34887	the bank of the Drissa. As there was not a single town or large
 34888	village in the vicinity of the camp, the immense number of generals and
 34889	courtiers accompanying the army were living in the best houses of the
 34890	villages on both sides of the river, over a radius of six miles. Barclay
 34891	de Tolly was quartered nearly three miles from the Emperor. He received
 34892	BolkÃ³nski stiffly and coldly and told him in his foreign accent that he
 34893	would mention him to the Emperor for a decision as to his employment,
 34894	but asked him meanwhile to remain on his staff. Anatole KurÃ¡gin, whom
 34895	Prince Andrew had hoped to find with the army, was not there. He had
 34896	gone to Petersburg, but Prince Andrew was glad to hear this. His mind
 34897	was occupied by the interests of the center that was conducting
 34898	a gigantic war, and he was glad to be free for a while from the
 34899	distraction caused by the thought of KurÃ¡gin. During the first four
 34900	days, while no duties were required of him, Prince Andrew rode round the
 34901	whole fortified camp and, by the aid of his own knowledge and by
 34902	talks with experts, tried to form a definite opinion about it. But the
 34903	question whether the camp was advantageous or disadvantageous remained
 34904	for him undecided. Already from his military experience and what he had
 34905	seen in the Austrian campaign, he had come to the conclusion that in
 34906	war the most deeply considered plans have no significance and that all
 34907	depends on the way unexpected movements of the enemyâthat cannot be
 34908	foreseenâare met, and on how and by whom the whole matter is handled.
 34909	To clear up this last point for himself, Prince Andrew, utilizing his
 34910	position and acquaintances, tried to fathom the character of the control
 34911	of the army and of the men and parties engaged in it, and he deduced for
 34912	himself the following of the state of affairs.
 34913	
 34914	While the Emperor had still been at VÃ­lna, the forces had been divided
 34915	into three armies. First, the army under Barclay de Tolly, secondly, the
 34916	army under BagratiÃ³n, and thirdly, the one commanded by TormÃ¡sov. The
 34917	Emperor was with the first army, but not as commander in chief. In the
 34918	orders issued it was stated, not that the Emperor would take command,
 34919	but only that he would be with the army. The Emperor, moreover, had
 34920	with him not a commander in chiefâs staff but the imperial headquarters
 34921	staff. In attendance on him was the head of the imperial staff,
 34922	Quartermaster General Prince VolkÃ³nski, as well as generals, imperial
 34923	aides-de-camp, diplomatic officials, and a large number of foreigners,
 34924	but not the army staff. Besides these, there were in attendance on the
 34925	Emperor without any definite appointments: ArakchÃ©ev, the ex-Minister
 34926	of War; Count Bennigsen, the senior general in rank; the Grand Duke
 34927	TsarÃ©vich Constantine PÃ¡vlovich; Count RumyÃ¡ntsev, the Chancellor;
 34928	Stein, a former Prussian minister; Armfeldt, a Swedish general; Pfuel,
 34929	the chief author of the plan of campaign; Paulucci, an adjutant general
 34930	and Sardinian Ã©migrÃ©; Wolzogenâand many others. Though these men had no
 34931	military appointment in the army, their position gave them influence,
 34932	and often a corps commander, or even the commander in chief, did not
 34933	know in what capacity he was questioned by Bennigsen, the Grand Duke,
 34934	ArakchÃ©ev, or Prince VolkÃ³nski, or was given this or that advice and did
 34935	not know whether a certain order received in the form of advice emanated
 34936	from the man who gave it or from the Emperor and whether it had to be
 34937	executed or not. But this was only the external condition; the essential
 34938	significance of the presence of the Emperor and of all these people,
 34939	from a courtierâs point of view (and in an Emperorâs vicinity all became
 34940	courtiers), was clear to everyone. It was this: the Emperor did not
 34941	assume the title of commander in chief, but disposed of all the armies;
 34942	the men around him were his assistants. ArakchÃ©ev was a faithful
 34943	custodian to enforce order and acted as the sovereignâs bodyguard.
 34944	Bennigsen was a landlord in the VÃ­lna province who appeared to be doing
 34945	the honors of the district, but was in reality a good general, useful
 34946	as an adviser and ready at hand to replace Barclay. The Grand Duke
 34947	was there because it suited him to be. The ex-Minister Stein was there
 34948	because his advice was useful and the Emperor Alexander held him in high
 34949	esteem personally. Armfeldt virulently hated Napoleon and was a general
 34950	full of self-confidence, a quality that always influenced Alexander.
 34951	Paulucci was there because he was bold and decided in speech. The
 34952	adjutants general were there because they always accompanied the
 34953	Emperor, and lastly and chiefly Pfuel was there because he had drawn up
 34954	the plan of campaign against Napoleon and, having induced Alexander to
 34955	believe in the efficacy of that plan, was directing the whole business
 34956	of the war. With Pfuel was Wolzogen, who expressed Pfuelâs thoughts in
 34957	a more comprehensible way than Pfuel himself (who was a harsh, bookish
 34958	theorist, self-confident to the point of despising everyone else) was
 34959	able to do.
 34960	
 34961	Besides these Russians and foreigners who propounded new and unexpected
 34962	ideas every dayâespecially the foreigners, who did so with a boldness
 34963	characteristic of people employed in a country not their ownâthere were
 34964	many secondary personages accompanying the army because their principals
 34965	were there.
 34966	
 34967	Among the opinions and voices in this immense, restless, brilliant,
 34968	and proud sphere, Prince Andrew noticed the following sharply defined
 34969	subdivisions of tendencies and parties:
 34970	
 34971	The first party consisted of Pfuel and his adherentsâmilitary theorists
 34972	who believed in a science of war with immutable lawsâlaws of oblique
 34973	movements, outflankings, and so forth. Pfuel and his adherents demanded
 34974	a retirement into the depths of the country in accordance with precise
 34975	laws defined by a pseudo-theory of war, and they saw only barbarism,
 34976	ignorance, or evil intention in every deviation from that theory. To
 34977	this party belonged the foreign nobles, Wolzogen, Wintzingerode, and
 34978	others, chiefly Germans.
 34979	
 34980	The second party was directly opposed to the first; one extreme, as
 34981	always happens, was met by representatives of the other. The members of
 34982	this party were those who had demanded an advance from VÃ­lna into Poland
 34983	and freedom from all prearranged plans. Besides being advocates of bold
 34984	action, this section also represented nationalism, which made them still
 34985	more one-sided in the dispute. They were Russians: BagratiÃ³n, ErmÃ³lov
 34986	(who was beginning to come to the front), and others. At that time a
 34987	famous joke of ErmÃ³lovâs was being circulated, that as a great favor he
 34988	had petitioned the Emperor to make him a German. The men of that party,
 34989	remembering SuvÃ³rov, said that what one had to do was not to reason,
 34990	or stick pins into maps, but to fight, beat the enemy, keep him out of
 34991	Russia, and not let the army get discouraged.
 34992	
 34993	To the third partyâin which the Emperor had most confidenceâbelonged the
 34994	courtiers who tried to arrange compromises between the other two. The
 34995	members of this party, chiefly civilians and to whom ArakchÃ©ev belonged,
 34996	thought and said what men who have no convictions but wish to seem to
 34997	have some generally say. They said that undoubtedly war, particularly
 34998	against such a genius as Bonaparte (they called him Bonaparte now),
 34999	needs most deeply devised plans and profound scientific knowledge and
 35000	in that respect Pfuel was a genius, but at the same time it had to be
 35001	acknowledged that the theorists are often one-sided, and therefore one
 35002	should not trust them absolutely, but should also listen to what Pfuelâs
 35003	opponents and practical men of experience in warfare had to say, and
 35004	then choose a middle course. They insisted on the retention of the camp
 35005	at Drissa, according to Pfuelâs plan, but on changing the movements of
 35006	the other armies. Though, by this course, neither one aim nor the other
 35007	could be attained, yet it seemed best to the adherents of this third
 35008	party.
 35009	
 35010	Of a fourth opinion the most conspicuous representative was the
 35011	TsarÃ©vich, who could not forget his disillusionment at Austerlitz, where
 35012	he had ridden out at the head of the Guards, in his casque and cavalry
 35013	uniform as to a review, expecting to crush the French gallantly; but
 35014	unexpectedly finding himself in the front line had narrowly escaped amid
 35015	the general confusion. The men of this party had both the quality
 35016	and the defect of frankness in their opinions. They feared Napoleon,
 35017	recognized his strength and their own weakness, and frankly said so.
 35018	They said: âNothing but sorrow, shame, and ruin will come of all this!
 35019	We have abandoned VÃ­lna and VÃ­tebsk and shall abandon Drissa. The only
 35020	reasonable thing left to do is to conclude peace as soon as possible,
 35021	before we are turned out of Petersburg.â
 35022	
 35023	This view was very general in the upper army circles and found support
 35024	also in Petersburg and from the chancellor, RumyÃ¡ntsev, who, for other
 35025	reasons of state, was in favor of peace.
 35026	
 35027	The fifth party consisted of those who were adherents of Barclay de
 35028	Tolly, not so much as a man but as minister of war and commander in
 35029	chief. âBe he what he mayâ (they always began like that), âhe is an
 35030	honest, practical man and we have nobody better. Give him real power,
 35031	for war cannot be conducted successfully without unity of command, and
 35032	he will show what he can do, as he did in Finland. If our army is well
 35033	organized and strong and has withdrawn to Drissa without suffering
 35034	any defeats, we owe this entirely to Barclay. If Barclay is now to
 35035	be superseded by Bennigsen all will be lost, for Bennigsen showed his
 35036	incapacity already in 1807.â
 35037	
 35038	The sixth party, the Bennigsenites, said, on the contrary, that at any
 35039	rate there was no one more active and experienced than Bennigsen: âand
 35040	twist about as you may, you will have to come to Bennigsen eventually.
 35041	Let the others make mistakes now!â said they, arguing that our
 35042	retirement to Drissa was a most shameful reverse and an unbroken series
 35043	of blunders. âThe more mistakes that are made the better. It will at any
 35044	rate be understood all the sooner that things cannot go on like this.
 35045	What is wanted is not some Barclay or other, but a man like Bennigsen,
 35046	who made his mark in 1807, and to whom Napoleon himself did justiceâa
 35047	man whose authority would be willingly recognized, and Bennigsen is the
 35048	only such man.â
 35049	
 35050	The seventh party consisted of the sort of people who are always to
 35051	be found, especially around young sovereigns, and of whom there were
 35052	particularly many round Alexanderâgenerals and imperial aides-de-camp
 35053	passionately devoted to the Emperor, not merely as a monarch but as a
 35054	man, adoring him sincerely and disinterestedly, as RostÃ³v had done
 35055	in 1805, and who saw in him not only all the virtues but all human
 35056	capabilities as well. These men, though enchanted with the sovereign
 35057	for refusing the command of the army, yet blamed him for such excessive
 35058	modesty, and only desired and insisted that their adored sovereign
 35059	should abandon his diffidence and openly announce that he would place
 35060	himself at the head of the army, gather round him a commander in chiefâs
 35061	staff, and, consulting experienced theoreticians and practical men where
 35062	necessary, would himself lead the troops, whose spirits would thereby be
 35063	raised to the highest pitch.
 35064	
 35065	The eighth and largest group, which in its enormous numbers was to the
 35066	others as ninety-nine to one, consisted of men who desired neither
 35067	peace nor war, neither an advance nor a defensive camp at the Drissa
 35068	or anywhere else, neither Barclay nor the Emperor, neither Pfuel nor
 35069	Bennigsen, but only the one most essential thingâas much advantage
 35070	and pleasure for themselves as possible. In the troubled waters of
 35071	conflicting and intersecting intrigues that eddied about the Emperorâs
 35072	headquarters, it was possible to succeed in many ways unthinkable at
 35073	other times. A man who simply wished to retain his lucrative post would
 35074	today agree with Pfuel, tomorrow with his opponent, and the day after,
 35075	merely to avoid responsibility or to please the Emperor, would declare
 35076	that he had no opinion at all on the matter. Another who wished to
 35077	gain some advantage would attract the Emperorâs attention by loudly
 35078	advocating the very thing the Emperor had hinted at the day before,
 35079	and would dispute and shout at the council, beating his breast and
 35080	challenging those who did not agree with him to duels, thereby proving
 35081	that he was prepared to sacrifice himself for the common good. A third,
 35082	in the absence of opponents, between two councils would simply solicit
 35083	a special gratuity for his faithful services, well knowing that at that
 35084	moment people would be too busy to refuse him. A fourth while seemingly
 35085	overwhelmed with work would often come accidentally under the Emperorâs
 35086	eye. A fifth, to achieve his long-cherished aim of dining with the
 35087	Emperor, would stubbornly insist on the correctness or falsity of some
 35088	newly emerging opinion and for this object would produce arguments more
 35089	or less forcible and correct.
 35090	
 35091	All the men of this party were fishing for rubles, decorations, and
 35092	promotions, and in this pursuit watched only the weathercock of imperial
 35093	favor, and directly they noticed it turning in any direction, this whole
 35094	drone population of the army began blowing hard that way, so that it
 35095	was all the harder for the Emperor to turn it elsewhere. Amid the
 35096	uncertainties of the position, with the menace of serious danger giving
 35097	a peculiarly threatening character to everything, amid this vortex of
 35098	intrigue, egotism, conflict of views and feelings, and the diversity
 35099	of race among these peopleâthis eighth and largest party of those
 35100	preoccupied with personal interests imparted great confusion and
 35101	obscurity to the common task. Whatever question arose, a swarm of these
 35102	drones, without having finished their buzzing on a previous theme, flew
 35103	over to the new one and by their hum drowned and obscured the voices of
 35104	those who were disputing honestly.
 35105	
 35106	From among all these parties, just at the time Prince Andrew reached
 35107	the army, another, a ninth party, was being formed and was beginning
 35108	to raise its voice. This was the party of the elders, reasonable men
 35109	experienced and capable in state affairs, who, without sharing any of
 35110	those conflicting opinions, were able to take a detached view of what
 35111	was going on at the staff at headquarters and to consider means of
 35112	escape from this muddle, indecision, intricacy, and weakness.
 35113	
 35114	The men of this party said and thought that what was wrong resulted
 35115	chiefly from the Emperorâs presence in the army with his military court
 35116	and from the consequent presence there of an indefinite, conditional,
 35117	and unsteady fluctuation of relations, which is in place at court but
 35118	harmful in an army; that a sovereign should reign but not command the
 35119	army, and that the only way out of the position would be for the Emperor
 35120	and his court to leave the army; that the mere presence of the Emperor
 35121	paralyzed the action of fifty thousand men required to secure his
 35122	personal safety, and that the worst commander in chief, if independent,
 35123	would be better than the very best one trammeled by the presence and
 35124	authority of the monarch.
 35125	
 35126	Just at the time Prince Andrew was living unoccupied at Drissa,
 35127	ShishkÃ³v, the Secretary of State and one of the chief representatives of
 35128	this party, wrote a letter to the Emperor which ArakchÃ©ev and BalashÃ«v
 35129	agreed to sign. In this letter, availing himself of permission given him
 35130	by the Emperor to discuss the general course of affairs, he respectfully
 35131	suggestedâon the plea that it was necessary for the sovereign to arouse
 35132	a warlike spirit in the people of the capitalâthat the Emperor should
 35133	leave the army.
 35134	
 35135	That arousing of the people by their sovereign and his call to them to
 35136	defend their countryâthe very incitement which was the chief cause of
 35137	Russiaâs triumph in so far as it was produced by the Tsarâs personal
 35138	presence in Moscowâwas suggested to the Emperor, and accepted by him, as
 35139	a pretext for quitting the army.
 35140	
 35141	
 35142	
 35143	
 35144	
 35145	CHAPTER X
 35146	
 35147	This letter had not yet been presented to the Emperor when Barclay, one
 35148	day at dinner, informed BolkÃ³nski that the sovereign wished to see him
 35149	personally, to question him about Turkey, and that Prince Andrew was to
 35150	present himself at Bennigsenâs quarters at six that evening.
 35151	
 35152	News was received at the Emperorâs quarters that very day of a fresh
 35153	movement by Napoleon which might endanger the armyânews subsequently
 35154	found to be false. And that morning Colonel Michaud had ridden round the
 35155	Drissa fortifications with the Emperor and had pointed out to him that
 35156	this fortified camp constructed by Pfuel, and till then considered
 35157	a chef-dâoeuvre of tactical science which would ensure Napoleonâs
 35158	destruction, was an absurdity, threatening the destruction of the
 35159	Russian army.
 35160	
 35161	Prince Andrew arrived at Bennigsenâs quartersâa country gentlemanâs
 35162	house of moderate size, situated on the very banks of the river. Neither
 35163	Bennigsen nor the Emperor was there, but ChernÃ½shev, the Emperorâs
 35164	aide-de-camp, received BolkÃ³nski and informed him that the Emperor,
 35165	accompanied by General Bennigsen and Marquis Paulucci, had gone a second
 35166	time that day to inspect the fortifications of the Drissa camp, of the
 35167	suitability of which serious doubts were beginning to be felt.
 35168	
 35169	ChernÃ½shev was sitting at a window in the first room with a French novel
 35170	in his hand. This room had probably been a music room; there was still
 35171	an organ in it on which some rugs were piled, and in one corner stood
 35172	the folding bedstead of Bennigsenâs adjutant. This adjutant was also
 35173	there and sat dozing on the rolled-up bedding, evidently exhausted by
 35174	work or by feasting. Two doors led from the room, one straight on into
 35175	what had been the drawing room, and another, on the right, to the study.
 35176	Through the first door came the sound of voices conversing in German
 35177	and occasionally in French. In that drawing room were gathered, by
 35178	the Emperorâs wish, not a military council (the Emperor preferred
 35179	indefiniteness), but certain persons whose opinions he wished to know in
 35180	view of the impending difficulties. It was not a council of war, but,
 35181	as it were, a council to elucidate certain questions for the Emperor
 35182	personally. To this semicouncil had been invited the Swedish General
 35183	Armfeldt, Adjutant General Wolzogen, Wintzingerode (whom Napoleon had
 35184	referred to as a renegade French subject), Michaud, Toll, Count Stein
 35185	who was not a military man at all, and Pfuel himself, who, as Prince
 35186	Andrew had heard, was the mainspring of the whole affair. Prince Andrew
 35187	had an opportunity of getting a good look at him, for Pfuel arrived soon
 35188	after himself and, in passing through to the drawing room, stopped a
 35189	minute to speak to ChernÃ½shev.
 35190	
 35191	At first sight, Pfuel, in his ill-made uniform of a Russian general,
 35192	which fitted him badly like a fancy costume, seemed familiar to Prince
 35193	Andrew, though he saw him now for the first time. There was about
 35194	him something of Weyrother, Mack, and Schmidt, and many other German
 35195	theorist-generals whom Prince Andrew had seen in 1805, but he was more
 35196	typical than any of them. Prince Andrew had never yet seen a German
 35197	theorist in whom all the characteristics of those others were united to
 35198	such an extent.
 35199	
 35200	Pfuel was short and very thin but broad-boned, of coarse, robust build,
 35201	broad in the hips, and with prominent shoulder blades. His face was
 35202	much wrinkled and his eyes deep set. His hair had evidently been hastily
 35203	brushed smooth in front of the temples, but stuck up behind in quaint
 35204	little tufts. He entered the room, looking restlessly and angrily
 35205	around, as if afraid of everything in that large apartment. Awkwardly
 35206	holding up his sword, he addressed ChernÃ½shev and asked in German where
 35207	the Emperor was. One could see that he wished to pass through the rooms
 35208	as quickly as possible, finish with the bows and greetings, and sit down
 35209	to business in front of a map, where he would feel at home. He nodded
 35210	hurriedly in reply to ChernÃ½shev, and smiled ironically on hearing that
 35211	the sovereign was inspecting the fortifications that he, Pfuel, had
 35212	planned in accord with his theory. He muttered something to himself
 35213	abruptly and in a bass voice, as self-assured Germans doâit might
 35214	have been âstupid fellowâ... or âthe whole affair will be ruined,â or
 35215	âsomething absurd will come of it.â... Prince Andrew did not catch
 35216	what he said and would have passed on, but ChernÃ½shev introduced him to
 35217	Pfuel, remarking that Prince Andrew was just back from Turkey where the
 35218	war had terminated so fortunately. Pfuel barely glancedânot so much at
 35219	Prince Andrew as past himâand said, with a laugh: âThat must have been a
 35220	fine tactical warâ; and, laughing contemptuously, went on into the room
 35221	from which the sound of voices was heard.
 35222	
 35223	Pfuel, always inclined to be irritably sarcastic, was particularly
 35224	disturbed that day, evidently by the fact that they had dared to inspect
 35225	and criticize his camp in his absence. From this short interview with
 35226	Pfuel, Prince Andrew, thanks to his Austerlitz experiences, was able to
 35227	form a clear conception of the man. Pfuel was one of those hopelessly
 35228	and immutably self-confident men, self-confident to the point of
 35229	martyrdom as only Germans are, because only Germans are self-confident
 35230	on the basis of an abstract notionâscience, that is, the supposed
 35231	knowledge of absolute truth. A Frenchman is self-assured because he
 35232	regards himself personally, both in mind and body, as irresistibly
 35233	attractive to men and women. An Englishman is self-assured, as being a
 35234	citizen of the best-organized state in the world, and therefore as an
 35235	Englishman always knows what he should do and knows that all he does as
 35236	an Englishman is undoubtedly correct. An Italian is self-assured because
 35237	he is excitable and easily forgets himself and other people. A Russian
 35238	is self-assured just because he knows nothing and does not want to know
 35239	anything, since he does not believe that anything can be known. The
 35240	Germanâs self-assurance is worst of all, stronger and more
 35241	repulsive than any other, because he imagines that he knows the
 35242	truthâscienceâwhich he himself has invented but which is for him the
 35243	absolute truth.
 35244	
 35245	Pfuel was evidently of that sort. He had a scienceâthe theory of oblique
 35246	movements deduced by him from the history of Frederick the Greatâs wars,
 35247	and all he came across in the history of more recent warfare seemed to
 35248	him absurd and barbarousâmonstrous collisions in which so many blunders
 35249	were committed by both sides that these wars could not be called wars,
 35250	they did not accord with the theory, and therefore could not serve as
 35251	material for science.
 35252	
 35253	In 1806 Pfuel had been one of those responsible, for the plan of
 35254	campaign that ended in Jena and AuerstÃ¤dt, but he did not see the least
 35255	proof of the fallibility of his theory in the disasters of that war. On
 35256	the contrary, the deviations made from his theory were, in his opinion,
 35257	the sole cause of the whole disaster, and with characteristically
 35258	gleeful sarcasm he would remark, âThere, I said the whole affair would
 35259	go to the devil!â Pfuel was one of those theoreticians who so love
 35260	their theory that they lose sight of the theoryâs objectâits practical
 35261	application. His love of theory made him hate everything practical, and
 35262	he would not listen to it. He was even pleased by failures, for failures
 35263	resulting from deviations in practice from the theory only proved to him
 35264	the accuracy of his theory.
 35265	
 35266	He said a few words to Prince Andrew and ChernÃ½shev about the present
 35267	war, with the air of a man who knows beforehand that all will go wrong,
 35268	and who is not displeased that it should be so. The unbrushed tufts
 35269	of hair sticking up behind and the hastily brushed hair on his temples
 35270	expressed this most eloquently.
 35271	
 35272	He passed into the next room, and the deep, querulous sounds of his
 35273	voice were at once heard from there.
 35274	
 35275	
 35276	
 35277	
 35278	
 35279	CHAPTER XI
 35280	
 35281	Prince Andrewâs eyes were still following Pfuel out of the room when
 35282	Count Bennigsen entered hurriedly, and nodding to BolkÃ³nski, but not
 35283	pausing, went into the study, giving instructions to his adjutant as he
 35284	went. The Emperor was following him, and Bennigsen had hastened on
 35285	to make some preparations and to be ready to receive the sovereign.
 35286	ChernÃ½shev and Prince Andrew went out into the porch, where the Emperor,
 35287	who looked fatigued, was dismounting. Marquis Paulucci was talking to
 35288	him with particular warmth and the Emperor, with his head bent to the
 35289	left, was listening with a dissatisfied air. The Emperor moved forward
 35290	evidently wishing to end the conversation, but the flushed and excited
 35291	Italian, oblivious of decorum, followed him and continued to speak.
 35292	
 35293	âAnd as for the man who advised forming this campâthe Drissa camp,â said
 35294	Paulucci, as the Emperor mounted the steps and noticing Prince Andrew
 35295	scanned his unfamiliar face, âas to that person, sire...â continued
 35296	Paulucci, desperately, apparently unable to restrain himself, âthe man
 35297	who advised the Drissa campâI see no alternative but the lunatic asylum
 35298	or the gallows!â
 35299	
 35300	Without heeding the end of the Italianâs remarks, and as though
 35301	not hearing them, the Emperor, recognizing BolkÃ³nski, addressed him
 35302	graciously.
 35303	
 35304	âI am very glad to see you! Go in there where they are meeting, and wait
 35305	for me.â
 35306	
 35307	The Emperor went into the study. He was followed by Prince Peter
 35308	MikhÃ¡ylovich VolkÃ³nski and Baron Stein, and the door closed behind them.
 35309	Prince Andrew, taking advantage of the Emperorâs permission, accompanied
 35310	Paulucci, whom he had known in Turkey, into the drawing room where the
 35311	council was assembled.
 35312	
 35313	Prince Peter MikhÃ¡ylovich VolkÃ³nski occupied the position, as it were,
 35314	of chief of the Emperorâs staff. He came out of the study into the
 35315	drawing room with some maps which he spread on a table, and put
 35316	questions on which he wished to hear the opinion of the gentlemen
 35317	present. What had happened was that news (which afterwards proved to be
 35318	false) had been received during the night of a movement by the French to
 35319	outflank the Drissa camp.
 35320	
 35321	The first to speak was General Armfeldt who, to meet the difficulty that
 35322	presented itself, unexpectedly proposed a perfectly new position
 35323	away from the Petersburg and Moscow roads. The reason for this was
 35324	inexplicable (unless he wished to show that he, too, could have an
 35325	opinion), but he urged that at this point the army should unite and
 35326	there await the enemy. It was plain that Armfeldt had thought out that
 35327	plan long ago and now expounded it not so much to answer the questions
 35328	putâwhich, in fact, his plan did not answerâas to avail himself of the
 35329	opportunity to air it. It was one of the millions of proposals, one as
 35330	good as another, that could be made as long as it was quite unknown
 35331	what character the war would take. Some disputed his arguments, others
 35332	defended them. Young Count Toll objected to the Swedish generalâs views
 35333	more warmly than anyone else, and in the course of the dispute drew from
 35334	his side pocket a well-filled notebook, which he asked permission to
 35335	read to them. In these voluminous notes Toll suggested another scheme,
 35336	totally different from Armfeldtâs or Pfuelâs plan of campaign. In answer
 35337	to Toll, Paulucci suggested an advance and an attack, which, he urged,
 35338	could alone extricate us from the present uncertainty and from the trap
 35339	(as he called the Drissa camp) in which we were situated.
 35340	
 35341	During all these discussions Pfuel and his interpreter, Wolzogen
 35342	(his âbridgeâ in court relations), were silent. Pfuel only snorted
 35343	contemptuously and turned away, to show that he would never demean
 35344	himself by replying to such nonsense as he was now hearing. So when
 35345	Prince VolkÃ³nski, who was in the chair, called on him to give his
 35346	opinion, he merely said:
 35347	
 35348	âWhy ask me? General Armfeldt has proposed a splendid position with an
 35349	exposed rear, or why not this Italian gentlemanâs attackâvery fine, or
 35350	a retreat, also good! Why ask me?â said he. âWhy, you yourselves know
 35351	everything better than I do.â
 35352	
 35353	But when VolkÃ³nski said, with a frown, that it was in the Emperorâs name
 35354	that he asked his opinion, Pfuel rose and, suddenly growing animated,
 35355	began to speak:
 35356	
 35357	âEverything has been spoiled, everything muddled, everybody thought they
 35358	knew better than I did, and now you come to me! How mend matters? There
 35359	is nothing to mend! The principles laid down by me must be strictly
 35360	adhered to,â said he, drumming on the table with his bony fingers. âWhat
 35361	is the difficulty? Nonsense, childishness!â
 35362	
 35363	He went up to the map and speaking rapidly began proving that no
 35364	eventuality could alter the efficiency of the Drissa camp, that
 35365	everything had been foreseen, and that if the enemy were really going to
 35366	outflank it, the enemy would inevitably be destroyed.
 35367	
 35368	Paulucci, who did not know German, began questioning him in French.
 35369	Wolzogen came to the assistance of his chief, who spoke French badly,
 35370	and began translating for him, hardly able to keep pace with Pfuel, who
 35371	was rapidly demonstrating that not only all that had happened, but all
 35372	that could happen, had been foreseen in his scheme, and that if there
 35373	were now any difficulties the whole fault lay in the fact that his plan
 35374	had not been precisely executed. He kept laughing sarcastically, he
 35375	demonstrated, and at last contemptuously ceased to demonstrate, like
 35376	a mathematician who ceases to prove in various ways the accuracy of
 35377	a problem that has already been proved. Wolzogen took his place and
 35378	continued to explain his views in French, every now and then turning to
 35379	Pfuel and saying, âIs it not so, your excellency?â But Pfuel, like a man
 35380	heated in a fight who strikes those on his own side, shouted angrily at
 35381	his own supporter, Wolzogen:
 35382	
 35383	âWell, of course, what more is there to explain?â
 35384	
 35385	Paulucci and Michaud both attacked Wolzogen simultaneously in French.
 35386	Armfeldt addressed Pfuel in German. Toll explained to VolkÃ³nski in
 35387	Russian. Prince Andrew listened and observed in silence.
 35388	
 35389	Of all these men Prince Andrew sympathized most with Pfuel, angry,
 35390	determined, and absurdly self-confident as he was. Of all those present,
 35391	evidently he alone was not seeking anything for himself, nursed no
 35392	hatred against anyone, and only desired that the plan, formed on a
 35393	theory arrived at by years of toil, should be carried out. He was
 35394	ridiculous, and unpleasantly sarcastic, but yet he inspired involuntary
 35395	respect by his boundless devotion to an idea. Besides this, the remarks
 35396	of all except Pfuel had one common trait that had not been noticeable
 35397	at the council of war in 1805: there was now a panic fear of Napoleonâs
 35398	genius, which, though concealed, was noticeable in every rejoinder.
 35399	Everything was assumed to be possible for Napoleon, they expected him
 35400	from every side, and invoked his terrible name to shatter each otherâs
 35401	proposals. Pfuel alone seemed to consider Napoleon a barbarian like
 35402	everyone else who opposed his theory. But besides this feeling of
 35403	respect, Pfuel evoked pity in Prince Andrew. From the tone in which
 35404	the courtiers addressed him and the way Paulucci had allowed himself to
 35405	speak of him to the Emperor, but above all from a certain desperation
 35406	in Pfuelâs own expressions, it was clear that the others knew, and Pfuel
 35407	himself felt, that his fall was at hand. And despite his self-confidence
 35408	and grumpy German sarcasm he was pitiable, with his hair smoothly
 35409	brushed on the temples and sticking up in tufts behind. Though he
 35410	concealed the fact under a show of irritation and contempt, he was
 35411	evidently in despair that the sole remaining chance of verifying his
 35412	theory by a huge experiment and proving its soundness to the whole world
 35413	was slipping away from him.
 35414	
 35415	The discussions continued a long time, and the longer they lasted
 35416	the more heated became the disputes, culminating in shouts and
 35417	personalities, and the less was it possible to arrive at any general
 35418	conclusion from all that had been said. Prince Andrew, listening to this
 35419	polyglot talk and to these surmises, plans, refutations, and shouts,
 35420	felt nothing but amazement at what they were saying. A thought that had
 35421	long since and often occurred to him during his military activitiesâthe
 35422	idea that there is not and cannot be any science of war, and that
 35423	therefore there can be no such thing as a military geniusânow appeared
 35424	to him an obvious truth. âWhat theory and science is possible about a
 35425	matter the conditions and circumstances of which are unknown and cannot
 35426	be defined, especially when the strength of the acting forces cannot be
 35427	ascertained? No one was or is able to foresee in what condition our or
 35428	the enemyâs armies will be in a dayâs time, and no one can gauge the
 35429	force of this or that detachment. Sometimesâwhen there is not a coward
 35430	at the front to shout, âWe are cut off!â and start running, but a brave
 35431	and jolly lad who shouts, âHurrah!ââa detachment of five thousand
 35432	is worth thirty thousand, as at SchÃ¶n Grabern, while at times fifty
 35433	thousand run from eight thousand, as at Austerlitz. What science can
 35434	there be in a matter in which, as in all practical matters, nothing
 35435	can be defined and everything depends on innumerable conditions, the
 35436	significance of which is determined at a particular moment which arrives
 35437	no one knows when? Armfeldt says our army is cut in half, and Paulucci
 35438	says we have got the French army between two fires; Michaud says that
 35439	the worthlessness of the Drissa camp lies in having the river behind it,
 35440	and Pfuel says that is what constitutes its strength; Toll proposes
 35441	one plan, Armfeldt another, and they are all good and all bad, and the
 35442	advantages of any suggestions can be seen only at the moment of trial.
 35443	And why do they all speak of a âmilitary geniusâ? Is a man a genius who
 35444	can order bread to be brought up at the right time and say who is to go
 35445	to the right and who to the left? It is only because military men are
 35446	invested with pomp and power and crowds of sychophants flatter power,
 35447	attributing to it qualities of genius it does not possess. The best
 35448	generals I have known were, on the contrary, stupid or absent-minded
 35449	men. BagratiÃ³n was the best, Napoleon himself admitted that. And of
 35450	Bonaparte himself! I remember his limited, self-satisfied face on the
 35451	field of Austerlitz. Not only does a good army commander not need any
 35452	special qualities, on the contrary he needs the absence of the highest
 35453	and best human attributesâlove, poetry, tenderness, and philosophic
 35454	inquiring doubt. He should be limited, firmly convinced that what he
 35455	is doing is very important (otherwise he will not have sufficient
 35456	patience), and only then will he be a brave leader. God forbid that he
 35457	should be humane, should love, or pity, or think of what is just
 35458	and unjust. It is understandable that a theory of their âgeniusâ was
 35459	invented for them long ago because they have power! The success of a
 35460	military action depends not on them, but on the man in the ranks who
 35461	shouts, âWe are lost!â or who shouts, âHurrah!â And only in the ranks
 35462	can one serve with assurance of being useful.â
 35463	
 35464	So thought Prince Andrew as he listened to the talking, and he roused
 35465	himself only when Paulucci called him and everyone was leaving.
 35466	
 35467	At the review next day the Emperor asked Prince Andrew where he would
 35468	like to serve, and Prince Andrew lost his standing in court circles
 35469	forever by not asking to remain attached to the sovereignâs person, but
 35470	for permission to serve in the army.
 35471	
 35472

 35475	
 35476	CHAPTER XII
 35477	
 35478	Before the beginning of the campaign, RostÃ³v had received a letter from
 35479	his parents in which they told him briefly of NatÃ¡shaâs illness and the
 35480	breaking off of her engagement to Prince Andrew (which they explained by
 35481	NatÃ¡shaâs having rejected him) and again asked Nicholas to retire from
 35482	the army and return home. On receiving this letter, Nicholas did not
 35483	even make any attempt to get leave of absence or to retire from the
 35484	army, but wrote to his parents that he was sorry NatÃ¡sha was ill and her
 35485	engagement broken off, and that he would do all he could to meet their
 35486	wishes. To SÃ³nya he wrote separately.
 35487	
 35488	âAdored friend of my soul!â he wrote. âNothing but honor could keep
 35489	me from returning to the country. But now, at the commencement of the
 35490	campaign, I should feel dishonored, not only in my comradesâ eyes but
 35491	in my own, if I preferred my own happiness to my love and duty to the
 35492	Fatherland. But this shall be our last separation. Believe me, directly
 35493	the war is over, if I am still alive and still loved by you, I will
 35494	throw up everything and fly to you, to press you forever to my ardent
 35495	breast.â
 35496	
 35497	It was, in fact, only the commencement of the campaign that prevented
 35498	RostÃ³v from returning home as he had promised and marrying SÃ³nya. The
 35499	autumn in OtrÃ¡dnoe with the hunting, and the winter with the Christmas
 35500	holidays and SÃ³nyaâs love, had opened out to him a vista of tranquil
 35501	rural joys and peace such as he had never known before, and which now
 35502	allured him. âA splendid wife, children, a good pack of hounds, a
 35503	dozen leashes of smart borzois, agriculture, neighbors, service by
 35504	election...â thought he. But now the campaign was beginning, and he had
 35505	to remain with his regiment. And since it had to be so, Nicholas RostÃ³v,
 35506	as was natural to him, felt contented with the life he led in the
 35507	regiment and was able to find pleasure in that life.
 35508	
 35509	On his return from his furlough Nicholas, having been joyfully welcomed
 35510	by his comrades, was sent to obtain remounts and brought back from the
 35511	Ukraine excellent horses which pleased him and earned him commendation
 35512	from his commanders. During his absence he had been promoted captain,
 35513	and when the regiment was put on war footing with an increase in
 35514	numbers, he was again allotted his old squadron.
 35515	
 35516	The campaign began, the regiment was moved into Poland on double pay,
 35517	new officers arrived, new men and horses, and above all everybody was
 35518	infected with the merrily excited mood that goes with the commencement
 35519	of a war, and RostÃ³v, conscious of his advantageous position in the
 35520	regiment, devoted himself entirely to the pleasures and interests of
 35521	military service, though he knew that sooner or later he would have to
 35522	relinquish them.
 35523	
 35524	The troops retired from VÃ­lna for various complicated reasons of state,
 35525	political and strategic. Each step of the retreat was accompanied by
 35526	a complicated interplay of interests, arguments, and passions at
 35527	headquarters. For the PÃ¡vlograd hussars, however, the whole of this
 35528	retreat during the finest period of summer and with sufficient supplies
 35529	was a very simple and agreeable business.
 35530	
 35531	It was only at headquarters that there was depression, uneasiness, and
 35532	intriguing; in the body of the army they did not ask themselves where
 35533	they were going or why. If they regretted having to retreat, it was only
 35534	because they had to leave billets they had grown accustomed to, or some
 35535	pretty young Polish lady. If the thought that things looked bad chanced
 35536	to enter anyoneâs head, he tried to be as cheerful as befits a good
 35537	soldier and not to think of the general trend of affairs, but only of
 35538	the task nearest to hand. First they camped gaily before VÃ­lna, making
 35539	acquaintance with the Polish landowners, preparing for reviews and being
 35540	reviewed by the Emperor and other high commanders. Then came an order
 35541	to retreat to SventsyÃ¡ni and destroy any provisions they could not carry
 35542	away with them. SventsyÃ¡ni was remembered by the hussars only as the
 35543	drunken camp, a name the whole army gave to their encampment there,
 35544	and because many complaints were made against the troops, who, taking
 35545	advantage of the order to collect provisions, took also horses,
 35546	carriages, and carpets from the Polish proprietors. RostÃ³v remembered
 35547	SventsyÃ¡ni, because on the first day of their arrival at that small town
 35548	he changed his sergeant major and was unable to manage all the drunken
 35549	men of his squadron who, unknown to him, had appropriated five barrels
 35550	of old beer. From SventsyÃ¡ni they retired farther and farther to Drissa,
 35551	and thence again beyond Drissa, drawing near to the frontier of Russia
 35552	proper.
 35553	
 35554	On the thirteenth of July the PÃ¡vlograds took part in a serious action
 35555	for the first time.
 35556	
 35557	On the twelfth of July, on the eve of that action, there was a heavy
 35558	storm of rain and hail. In general, the summer of 1812 was remarkable
 35559	for its storms.
 35560	
 35561	The two PÃ¡vlograd squadrons were bivouacking on a field of rye, which
 35562	was already in ear but had been completely trodden down by cattle and
 35563	horses. The rain was descending in torrents, and RostÃ³v, with a young
 35564	officer named IlyÃ­n, his protÃ©gÃ©, was sitting in a hastily constructed
 35565	shelter. An officer of their regiment, with long mustaches extending
 35566	onto his cheeks, who after riding to the staff had been overtaken by the
 35567	rain, entered RostÃ³vâs shelter.
 35568	
 35569	âI have come from the staff, Count. Have you heard of RaÃ©vskiâs
 35570	exploit?â
 35571	
 35572	And the officer gave them details of the SaltÃ¡nov battle, which he had
 35573	heard at the staff.
 35574	
 35575	RostÃ³v, smoking his pipe and turning his head about as the water
 35576	trickled down his neck, listened inattentively, with an occasional
 35577	glance at IlyÃ­n, who was pressing close to him. This officer, a lad
 35578	of sixteen who had recently joined the regiment, was now in the same
 35579	relation to Nicholas that Nicholas had been to DenÃ­sov seven years
 35580	before. IlyÃ­n tried to imitate RostÃ³v in everything and adored him as a
 35581	girl might have done.
 35582	
 35583	Zdrzhinski, the officer with the long mustache, spoke grandiloquently of
 35584	the SaltÃ¡nov dam being âa Russian Thermopylae,â and of how a deed worthy
 35585	of antiquity had been performed by General RaÃ©vski. He recounted how
 35586	RaÃ©vski had led his two sons onto the dam under terrific fire and had
 35587	charged with them beside him. RostÃ³v heard the story and not only said
 35588	nothing to encourage Zdrzhinskiâs enthusiasm but, on the contrary,
 35589	looked like a man ashamed of what he was hearing, though with no
 35590	intention of contradicting it. Since the campaigns of Austerlitz and
 35591	of 1807 RostÃ³v knew by experience that men always lie when describing
 35592	military exploits, as he himself had done when recounting them; besides
 35593	that, he had experience enough to know that nothing happens in war at
 35594	all as we can imagine or relate it. And so he did not like Zdrzhinskiâs
 35595	tale, nor did he like Zdrzhinski himself who, with his mustaches
 35596	extending over his cheeks, bent low over the face of his hearer, as was
 35597	his habit, and crowded RostÃ³v in the narrow shanty. RostÃ³v looked at him
 35598	in silence. âIn the first place, there must have been such a confusion
 35599	and crowding on the dam that was being attacked that if RaÃ©vski did lead
 35600	his sons there, it could have had no effect except perhaps on some dozen
 35601	men nearest to him,â thought he, âthe rest could not have seen how or
 35602	with whom RaÃ©vski came onto the dam. And even those who did see it
 35603	would not have been much stimulated by it, for what had they to do with
 35604	RaÃ©vskiâs tender paternal feelings when their own skins were in danger?
 35605	And besides, the fate of the Fatherland did not depend on whether
 35606	they took the SaltÃ¡nov dam or not, as we are told was the case at
 35607	Thermopylae. So why should he have made such a sacrifice? And why expose
 35608	his own children in the battle? I would not have taken my brother PÃ©tya
 35609	there, or even IlyÃ­n, whoâs a stranger to me but a nice lad, but would
 35610	have tried to put them somewhere under cover,â Nicholas continued
 35611	to think, as he listened to Zdrzhinski. But he did not express his
 35612	thoughts, for in such matters, too, he had gained experience. He knew
 35613	that this tale redounded to the glory of our arms and so one had to
 35614	pretend not to doubt it. And he acted accordingly.
 35615	
 35616	âI canât stand this any more,â said IlyÃ­n, noticing that RostÃ³v did not
 35617	relish Zdrzhinskiâs conversation. âMy stockings and shirt... and the
 35618	water is running on my seat! Iâll go and look for shelter. The rain
 35619	seems less heavy.â
 35620	
 35621	IlyÃ­n went out and Zdrzhinski rode away.
 35622	
 35623	Five minutes later IlyÃ­n, splashing through the mud, came running back
 35624	to the shanty.
 35625	
 35626	âHurrah! RostÃ³v, come quick! Iâve found it! About two hundred yards away
 35627	thereâs a tavern where ours have already gathered. We can at least get
 35628	dry there, and Mary HendrÃ­khovnaâs there.â
 35629	
 35630	Mary HendrÃ­khovna was the wife of the regimental doctor, a pretty young
 35631	German woman he had married in Poland. The doctor, whether from lack
 35632	of means or because he did not like to part from his young wife in
 35633	the early days of their marriage, took her about with him wherever the
 35634	hussar regiment went and his jealousy had become a standing joke among
 35635	the hussar officers.
 35636	
 35637	RostÃ³v threw his cloak over his shoulders, shouted to LavrÃºshka to
 35638	follow with the things, andânow slipping in the mud, now splashing right
 35639	through itâset off with IlyÃ­n in the lessening rain and the darkness
 35640	that was occasionally rent by distant lightning.
 35641	
 35642	âRostÃ³v, where are you?â
 35643	
 35644	âHere. What lightning!â they called to one another.
 35645	
 35646	
 35647	
 35648	
 35649	
 35650	CHAPTER XIII
 35651	
 35652	In the tavern, before which stood the doctorâs covered cart, there were
 35653	already some five officers. Mary HendrÃ­khovna, a plump little blonde
 35654	German, in a dressing jacket and nightcap, was sitting on a broad bench
 35655	in the front corner. Her husband, the doctor, lay asleep behind her.
 35656	RostÃ³v and IlyÃ­n, on entering the room, were welcomed with merry shouts
 35657	and laughter.
 35658	
 35659	âDear me, how jolly we are!â said RostÃ³v laughing.
 35660	
 35661	âAnd why do you stand there gaping?â
 35662	
 35663	âWhat swells they are! Why, the water streams from them! Donât make our
 35664	drawing room so wet.â
 35665	
 35666	âDonât mess Mary HendrÃ­khovnaâs dress!â cried other voices.
 35667	
 35668	RostÃ³v and IlyÃ­n hastened to find a corner where they could change into
 35669	dry clothes without offending Mary HendrÃ­khovnaâs modesty. They were
 35670	going into a tiny recess behind a partition to change, but found it
 35671	completely filled by three officers who sat playing cards by the light
 35672	of a solitary candle on an empty box, and these officers would on no
 35673	account yield their position. Mary HendrÃ­khovna obliged them with the
 35674	loan of a petticoat to be used as a curtain, and behind that screen
 35675	RostÃ³v and IlyÃ­n, helped by LavrÃºshka who had brought their kits,
 35676	changed their wet things for dry ones.
 35677	
 35678	A fire was made up in the dilapidated brick stove. A board was found,
 35679	fixed on two saddles and covered with a horsecloth, a small samovar was
 35680	produced and a cellaret and half a bottle of rum, and having asked Mary
 35681	HendrÃ­khovna to preside, they all crowded round her. One offered her a
 35682	clean handkerchief to wipe her charming hands, another spread a jacket
 35683	under her little feet to keep them from the damp, another hung his coat
 35684	over the window to keep out the draft, and yet another waved the flies
 35685	off her husbandâs face, lest he should wake up.
 35686	
 35687	âLeave him alone,â said Mary HendrÃ­khovna, smiling timidly and happily.
 35688	âHe is sleeping well as it is, after a sleepless night.â
 35689	
 35690	âOh, no, Mary HendrÃ­khovna,â replied the officer, âone must look after
 35691	the doctor. Perhaps heâll take pity on me someday, when it comes to
 35692	cutting off a leg or an arm for me.â
 35693	
 35694	There were only three tumblers, the water was so muddy that one could
 35695	not make out whether the tea was strong or weak, and the samovar held
 35696	only six tumblers of water, but this made it all the pleasanter to
 35697	take turns in order of seniority to receive oneâs tumbler from Mary
 35698	HendrÃ­khovnaâs plump little hands with their short and not overclean
 35699	nails. All the officers appeared to be, and really were, in love with
 35700	her that evening. Even those playing cards behind the partition soon
 35701	left their game and came over to the samovar, yielding to the general
 35702	mood of courting Mary HendrÃ­khovna. She, seeing herself surrounded by
 35703	such brilliant and polite young men, beamed with satisfaction, try as
 35704	she might to hide it, and perturbed as she evidently was each time her
 35705	husband moved in his sleep behind her.
 35706	
 35707	There was only one spoon, sugar was more plentiful than anything
 35708	else, but it took too long to dissolve, so it was decided that Mary
 35709	HendrÃ­khovna should stir the sugar for everyone in turn. RostÃ³v received
 35710	his tumbler, and adding some rum to it asked Mary HendrÃ­khovna to stir
 35711	it.
 35712	
 35713	âBut you take it without sugar?â she said, smiling all the time, as if
 35714	everything she said and everything the others said was very amusing and
 35715	had a double meaning.
 35716	
 35717	âIt is not the sugar I want, but only that your little hand should stir
 35718	my tea.â
 35719	
 35720	Mary HendrÃ­khovna assented and began looking for the spoon which someone
 35721	meanwhile had pounced on.
 35722	
 35723	âUse your finger, Mary HendrÃ­khovna, it will be still nicer,â said
 35724	RostÃ³v.
 35725	
 35726	âToo hot!â she replied, blushing with pleasure.
 35727	
 35728	IlyÃ­n put a few drops of rum into the bucket of water and brought it to
 35729	Mary HendrÃ­khovna, asking her to stir it with her finger.
 35730	
 35731	âThis is my cup,â said he. âOnly dip your finger in it and Iâll drink it
 35732	all up.â
 35733	
 35734	When they had emptied the samovar, RostÃ³v took a pack of cards and
 35735	proposed that they should play âKingsâ with Mary HendrÃ­khovna. They drew
 35736	lots to settle who should make up her set. At RostÃ³vâs suggestion it
 35737	was agreed that whoever became âKingâ should have the right to kiss Mary
 35738	HendrÃ­khovnaâs hand, and that the âBoobyâ should go to refill and reheat
 35739	the samovar for the doctor when the latter awoke.
 35740	
 35741	âWell, but supposing Mary HendrÃ­khovna is âKingâ?â asked IlyÃ­n.
 35742	
 35743	âAs it is, she is Queen, and her word is law!â
 35744	
 35745	They had hardly begun to play before the doctorâs disheveled head
 35746	suddenly appeared from behind Mary HendrÃ­khovna. He had been awake for
 35747	some time, listening to what was being said, and evidently found nothing
 35748	entertaining or amusing in what was going on. His face was sad and
 35749	depressed. Without greeting the officers, he scratched himself and asked
 35750	to be allowed to pass as they were blocking the way. As soon as he
 35751	had left the room all the officers burst into loud laughter and Mary
 35752	HendrÃ­khovna blushed till her eyes filled with tears and thereby became
 35753	still more attractive to them. Returning from the yard, the doctor
 35754	told his wife (who had ceased to smile so happily, and looked at him in
 35755	alarm, awaiting her sentence) that the rain had ceased and they must go
 35756	to sleep in their covered cart, or everything in it would be stolen.
 35757	
 35758	âBut Iâll send an orderly.... Two of them!â said RostÃ³v. âWhat an idea,
 35759	doctor!â
 35760	
 35761	âIâll stand guard on it myself!â said IlyÃ­n.
 35762	
 35763	âNo, gentlemen, you have had your sleep, but I have not slept for two
 35764	nights,â replied the doctor, and he sat down morosely beside his wife,
 35765	waiting for the game to end.
 35766	
 35767	Seeing his gloomy face as he frowned at his wife, the officers grew
 35768	still merrier, and some of them could not refrain from laughter, for
 35769	which they hurriedly sought plausible pretexts. When he had gone, taking
 35770	his wife with him, and had settled down with her in their covered cart,
 35771	the officers lay down in the tavern, covering themselves with their
 35772	wet cloaks, but they did not sleep for a long time; now they exchanged
 35773	remarks, recalling the doctorâs uneasiness and his wifeâs delight, now
 35774	they ran out into the porch and reported what was taking place in the
 35775	covered trap. Several times RostÃ³v, covering his head, tried to go
 35776	to sleep, but some remark would arouse him and conversation would be
 35777	resumed, to the accompaniment of unreasoning, merry, childlike laughter.
 35778

 35783	CHAPTER XIV
 35784	
 35785	It was nearly three oâclock but no one was yet asleep, when the
 35786	quartermaster appeared with an order to move on to the little town
 35787	of OstrÃ³vna. Still laughing and talking, the officers began hurriedly
 35788	getting ready and again boiled some muddy water in the samovar. But
 35789	RostÃ³v went off to his squadron without waiting for tea. Day was
 35790	breaking, the rain had ceased, and the clouds were dispersing. It felt
 35791	damp and cold, especially in clothes that were still moist. As they left
 35792	the tavern in the twilight of the dawn, RostÃ³v and IlyÃ­n both glanced
 35793	under the wet and glistening leather hood of the doctorâs cart, from
 35794	under the apron of which his feet were sticking out, and in the middle
 35795	of which his wifeâs nightcap was visible and her sleepy breathing
 35796	audible.
 35797	
 35798	âShe really is a dear little thing,â said RostÃ³v to IlyÃ­n, who was
 35799	following him.
 35800	
 35801	âA charming woman!â said IlyÃ­n, with all the gravity of a boy of
 35802	sixteen.
 35803	
 35804	Half an hour later the squadron was lined up on the road. The command
 35805	was heard to âmountâ and the soldiers crossed themselves and mounted.
 35806	RostÃ³v riding in front gave the order âForward!â and the hussars, with
 35807	clanking sabers and subdued talk, their horsesâ hoofs splashing in the
 35808	mud, defiled in fours and moved along the broad road planted with birch
 35809	trees on each side, following the infantry and a battery that had gone
 35810	on in front.
 35811	
 35812	Tattered, blue-purple clouds, reddening in the east, were scudding
 35813	before the wind. It was growing lighter and lighter. That curly grass
 35814	which always grows by country roadsides became clearly visible, still
 35815	wet with the nightâs rain; the drooping branches of the birches, also
 35816	wet, swayed in the wind and flung down bright drops of water to one
 35817	side. The soldiersâ faces were more and more clearly visible. RostÃ³v,
 35818	always closely followed by IlyÃ­n, rode along the side of the road
 35819	between two rows of birch trees.
 35820	
 35821	When campaigning, RostÃ³v allowed himself the indulgence of riding not
 35822	a regimental but a Cossack horse. A judge of horses and a sportsman,
 35823	he had lately procured himself a large, fine, mettlesome, DonÃ©ts horse,
 35824	dun-colored, with light mane and tail, and when he rode it no one could
 35825	outgallop him. To ride this horse was a pleasure to him, and he thought
 35826	of the horse, of the morning, of the doctorâs wife, but not once of the
 35827	impending danger.
 35828	
 35829	Formerly, when going into action, RostÃ³v had felt afraid; now he had
 35830	not the least feeling of fear. He was fearless, not because he had grown
 35831	used to being under fire (one cannot grow used to danger), but because
 35832	he had learned how to manage his thoughts when in danger. He had grown
 35833	accustomed when going into action to think about anything but what would
 35834	seem most likely to interest himâthe impending danger. During the
 35835	first period of his service, hard as he tried and much as he reproached
 35836	himself with cowardice, he had not been able to do this, but with time
 35837	it had come of itself. Now he rode beside IlyÃ­n under the birch trees,
 35838	occasionally plucking leaves from a branch that met his hand, sometimes
 35839	touching his horseâs side with his foot, or, without turning round,
 35840	handing a pipe he had finished to an hussar riding behind him, with as
 35841	calm and careless an air as though he were merely out for a ride. He
 35842	glanced with pity at the excited face of IlyÃ­n, who talked much and in
 35843	great agitation. He knew from experience the tormenting expectation of
 35844	terror and death the cornet was suffering and knew that only time could
 35845	help him.
 35846	
 35847	As soon as the sun appeared in a clear strip of sky beneath the clouds,
 35848	the wind fell, as if it dared not spoil the beauty of the summer morning
 35849	after the storm; drops still continued to fall, but vertically now, and
 35850	all was still. The whole sun appeared on the horizon and disappeared
 35851	behind a long narrow cloud that hung above it. A few minutes later it
 35852	reappeared brighter still from behind the top of the cloud, tearing its
 35853	edge. Everything grew bright and glittered. And with that light, and as
 35854	if in reply to it, came the sound of guns ahead of them.
 35855	
 35856	Before RostÃ³v had had time to consider and determine the distance of
 35857	that firing, Count Ostermann-TolstÃ³yâs adjutant came galloping from
 35858	VÃ­tebsk with orders to advance at a trot along the road.
 35859	
 35860	The squadron overtook and passed the infantry and the batteryâwhich had
 35861	also quickened their paceârode down a hill, and passing through an empty
 35862	and deserted village again ascended. The horses began to lather and the
 35863	men to flush.
 35864	
 35865	âHalt! Dress your ranks!â the order of the regimental commander was
 35866	heard ahead. âForward by the left. Walk, march!â came the order from in
 35867	front.
 35868	
 35869	And the hussars, passing along the line of troops on the left flank of
 35870	our position, halted behind our Uhlans who were in the front line. To
 35871	the right stood our infantry in a dense column: they were the reserve.
 35872	Higher up the hill, on the very horizon, our guns were visible through
 35873	the wonderfully clear air, brightly illuminated by slanting morning
 35874	sunbeams. In front, beyond a hollow dale, could be seen the enemyâs
 35875	columns and guns. Our advanced line, already in action, could be heard
 35876	briskly exchanging shots with the enemy in the dale.
 35877	
 35878	At these sounds, long unheard, RostÃ³vâs spirits rose, as at the strains
 35879	of the merriest music. Trap-ta-ta-tap! cracked the shots, now together,
 35880	now several quickly one after another. Again all was silent and then
 35881	again it sounded as if someone were walking on detonators and exploding
 35882	them.
 35883	
 35884	The hussars remained in the same place for about an hour. A cannonade
 35885	began. Count Ostermann with his suite rode up behind the squadron,
 35886	halted, spoke to the commander of the regiment, and rode up the hill to
 35887	the guns.
 35888	
 35889	After Ostermann had gone, a command rang out to the Uhlans.
 35890	
 35891	âForm column! Prepare to charge!â
 35892	
 35893	The infantry in front of them parted into platoons to allow the cavalry
 35894	to pass. The Uhlans started, the streamers on their spears fluttering,
 35895	and trotted downhill toward the French cavalry which was seen below to
 35896	the left.
 35897	
 35898	As soon as the Uhlans descended the hill, the hussars were ordered up
 35899	the hill to support the battery. As they took the places vacated by the
 35900	Uhlans, bullets came from the front, whining and whistling, but fell
 35901	spent without taking effect.
 35902	
 35903	The sounds, which he had not heard for so long, had an even more
 35904	pleasurable and exhilarating effect on RostÃ³v than the previous sounds
 35905	of firing. Drawing himself up, he viewed the field of battle opening out
 35906	before him from the hill, and with his whole soul followed the movement
 35907	of the Uhlans. They swooped down close to the French dragoons, something
 35908	confused happened there amid the smoke, and five minutes later our
 35909	Uhlans were galloping back, not to the place they had occupied but more
 35910	to the left, and among the orange-colored Uhlans on chestnut horses and
 35911	behind them, in a large group, blue French dragoons on gray horses could
 35912	be seen.
 35913

 35915	
 35916	
 35917	
 35918	CHAPTER XV
 35919	
 35920	RostÃ³v, with his keen sportsmanâs eye, was one of the first to catch
 35921	sight of these blue French dragoons pursuing our Uhlans. Nearer and
 35922	nearer in disorderly crowds came the Uhlans and the French dragoons
 35923	pursuing them. He could already see how these men, who looked so small
 35924	at the foot of the hill, jostled and overtook one another, waving their
 35925	arms and their sabers in the air.
 35926	
 35927	RostÃ³v gazed at what was happening before him as at a hunt. He felt
 35928	instinctively that if the hussars struck at the French dragoons now, the
 35929	latter could not withstand them, but if a charge was to be made it must
 35930	be done now, at that very moment, or it would be too late. He looked
 35931	around. A captain, standing beside him, was gazing like himself with
 35932	eyes fixed on the cavalry below them.
 35933	
 35934	âAndrew SevastyÃ¡nych!â said RostÃ³v. âYou know, we could crush them....â
 35935	
 35936	âA fine thing too!â replied the captain, âand really...â
 35937	
 35938	RostÃ³v, without waiting to hear him out, touched his horse, galloped to
 35939	the front of his squadron, and before he had time to finish giving the
 35940	word of command, the whole squadron, sharing his feeling, was following
 35941	him. RostÃ³v himself did not know how or why he did it. He acted as he
 35942	did when hunting, without reflecting or considering. He saw the dragoons
 35943	near and that they were galloping in disorder; he knew they could not
 35944	withstand an attackâknew there was only that moment and that if he let
 35945	it slip it would not return. The bullets were whining and whistling so
 35946	stimulatingly around him and his horse was so eager to go that he could
 35947	not restrain himself. He touched his horse, gave the word of command,
 35948	and immediately, hearing behind him the tramp of the horses of his
 35949	deployed squadron, rode at full trot downhill toward the dragoons.
 35950	Hardly had they reached the bottom of the hill before their pace
 35951	instinctively changed to a gallop, which grew faster and faster as they
 35952	drew nearer to our Uhlans and the French dragoons who galloped after
 35953	them. The dragoons were now close at hand. On seeing the hussars, the
 35954	foremost began to turn, while those behind began to halt. With the same
 35955	feeling with which he had galloped across the path of a wolf, RostÃ³v
 35956	gave rein to his DonÃ©ts horse and galloped to intersect the path of the
 35957	dragoonsâ disordered lines. One Uhlan stopped, another who was on foot
 35958	flung himself to the ground to avoid being knocked over, and a riderless
 35959	horse fell in among the hussars. Nearly all the French dragoons were
 35960	galloping back. RostÃ³v, picking out one on a gray horse, dashed after
 35961	him. On the way he came upon a bush, his gallant horse cleared it, and
 35962	almost before he had righted himself in his saddle he saw that he would
 35963	immediately overtake the enemy he had selected. That Frenchman, by his
 35964	uniform an officer, was going at a gallop, crouching on his gray horse
 35965	and urging it on with his saber. In another moment RostÃ³vâs horse dashed
 35966	its breast against the hindquarters of the officerâs horse, almost
 35967	knocking it over, and at the same instant RostÃ³v, without knowing why,
 35968	raised his saber and struck the Frenchman with it.
 35969	
 35970	The instant he had done this, all RostÃ³vâs animation vanished. The
 35971	officer fell, not so much from the blowâwhich had but slightly cut his
 35972	arm above the elbowâas from the shock to his horse and from fright.
 35973	RostÃ³v reined in his horse, and his eyes sought his foe to see whom he
 35974	had vanquished. The French dragoon officer was hopping with one foot on
 35975	the ground, the other being caught in the stirrup. His eyes, screwed
 35976	up with fear as if he every moment expected another blow, gazed up at
 35977	RostÃ³v with shrinking terror. His pale and mud-stained faceâfair and
 35978	young, with a dimple in the chin and light-blue eyesâwas not an enemyâs
 35979	face at all suited to a battlefield, but a most ordinary, homelike face.
 35980	Before RostÃ³v had decided what to do with him, the officer cried, âI
 35981	surrender!â He hurriedly but vainly tried to get his foot out of the
 35982	stirrup and did not remove his frightened blue eyes from RostÃ³vâs face.
 35983	Some hussars who galloped up disengaged his foot and helped him into the
 35984	saddle. On all sides, the hussars were busy with the dragoons; one was
 35985	wounded, but though his face was bleeding, he would not give up his
 35986	horse; another was perched up behind an hussar with his arms round him;
 35987	a third was being helped by an hussar to mount his horse. In front, the
 35988	French infantry were firing as they ran. The hussars galloped hastily
 35989	back with their prisoners. RostÃ³v galloped back with the rest, aware of
 35990	an unpleasant feeling of depression in his heart. Something vague and
 35991	confused, which he could not at all account for, had come over him with
 35992	the capture of that officer and the blow he had dealt him.
 35993	
 35994	Count Ostermann-TolstÃ³y met the returning hussars, sent for RostÃ³v,
 35995	thanked him, and said he would report his gallant deed to the Emperor
 35996	and would recommend him for a St. Georgeâs Cross. When sent for by Count
 35997	Ostermann, RostÃ³v, remembering that he had charged without orders,
 35998	felt sure his commander was sending for him to punish him for breach of
 35999	discipline. Ostermannâs flattering words and promise of a reward should
 36000	therefore have struck him all the more pleasantly, but he still felt
 36001	that same vaguely disagreeable feeling of moral nausea. âBut what
 36002	on earth is worrying me?â he asked himself as he rode back from the
 36003	general. âIlyÃ­n? No, heâs safe. Have I disgraced myself in any way? No,
 36004	thatâs not it.â Something else, resembling remorse, tormented him. âYes,
 36005	oh yes, that French officer with the dimple. And I remember how my arm
 36006	paused when I raised it.â
 36007	
 36008	RostÃ³v saw the prisoners being led away and galloped after them to have
 36009	a look at his Frenchman with the dimple on his chin. He was sitting in
 36010	his foreign uniform on an hussar packhorse and looked anxiously about
 36011	him. The sword cut on his arm could scarcely be called a wound. He
 36012	glanced at RostÃ³v with a feigned smile and waved his hand in greeting.
 36013	RostÃ³v still had the same indefinite feeling, as of shame.
 36014	
 36015	All that day and the next his friends and comrades noticed that RostÃ³v,
 36016	without being dull or angry, was silent, thoughtful, and preoccupied.
 36017	He drank reluctantly, tried to remain alone, and kept turning something
 36018	over in his mind.
 36019	
 36020	RostÃ³v was always thinking about that brilliant exploit of his, which to
 36021	his amazement had gained him the St. Georgeâs Cross and even given him
 36022	a reputation for bravery, and there was something he could not at all
 36023	understand. âSo others are even more afraid than I am!â he thought. âSo
 36024	thatâs all there is in what is called heroism! And did I do it for my
 36025	countryâs sake? And how was he to blame, with his dimple and blue eyes?
 36026	And how frightened he was! He thought that I should kill him. Why should
 36027	I kill him? My hand trembled. And they have given me a St. Georgeâs
 36028	Cross.... I canât make it out at all.â
 36029	
 36030	But while Nicholas was considering these questions and still could reach
 36031	no clear solution of what puzzled him so, the wheel of fortune in the
 36032	service, as often happens, turned in his favor. After the affair at
 36033	OstrÃ³vna he was brought into notice, received command of an hussar
 36034	battalion, and when a brave officer was needed he was chosen.

 36040	CHAPTER XVI
 36041	
 36042	On receiving news of NatÃ¡shaâs illness, the countess, though not quite
 36043	well yet and still weak, went to Moscow with PÃ©tya and the rest of the
 36044	household, and the whole family moved from MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievnaâs house to
 36045	their own and settled down in town.
 36046	
 36047	NatÃ¡shaâs illness was so serious that, fortunately for her and for
 36048	her parents, the consideration of all that had caused the illness,
 36049	her conduct and the breaking off of her engagement, receded into the
 36050	background. She was so ill that it was impossible for them to consider
 36051	in how far she was to blame for what had happened. She could not eat
 36052	or sleep, grew visibly thinner, coughed, and, as the doctors made them
 36053	feel, was in danger. They could not think of anything but how to help
 36054	her. Doctors came to see her singly and in consultation, talked much in
 36055	French, German, and Latin, blamed one another, and prescribed a great
 36056	variety of medicines for all the diseases known to them, but the simple
 36057	idea never occurred to any of them that they could not know the disease
 36058	NatÃ¡sha was suffering from, as no disease suffered by a live man can be
 36059	known, for every living person has his own peculiarities and always
 36060	has his own peculiar, personal, novel, complicated disease, unknown to
 36061	medicineânot a disease of the lungs, liver, skin, heart, nerves, and so
 36062	on mentioned in medical books, but a disease consisting of one of the
 36063	innumerable combinations of the maladies of those organs. This simple
 36064	thought could not occur to the doctors (as it cannot occur to a wizard
 36065	that he is unable to work his charms) because the business of their
 36066	lives was to cure, and they received money for it and had spent the best
 36067	years of their lives on that business. But, above all, that thought
 36068	was kept out of their minds by the fact that they saw they were
 36069	really useful, as in fact they were to the whole RostÃ³v family. Their
 36070	usefulness did not depend on making the patient swallow substances for
 36071	the most part harmful (the harm was scarcely perceptible, as they
 36072	were given in small doses), but they were useful, necessary, and
 36073	indispensable because they satisfied a mental need of the invalid and
 36074	of those who loved herâand that is why there are, and always will be,
 36075	pseudo-healers, wise women, homeopaths, and allopaths. They satisfied
 36076	that eternal human need for hope of relief, for sympathy, and that
 36077	something should be done, which is felt by those who are suffering. They
 36078	satisfied the need seen in its most elementary form in a child, when it
 36079	wants to have a place rubbed that has been hurt. A child knocks itself
 36080	and runs at once to the arms of its mother or nurse to have the aching
 36081	spot rubbed or kissed, and it feels better when this is done. The child
 36082	cannot believe that the strongest and wisest of its people have no
 36083	remedy for its pain, and the hope of relief and the expression of its
 36084	motherâs sympathy while she rubs the bump comforts it. The doctors were
 36085	of use to NatÃ¡sha because they kissed and rubbed her bump, assuring her
 36086	that it would soon pass if only the coachman went to the chemistâs in
 36087	the ArbÃ¡t and got a powder and some pills in a pretty box for a ruble
 36088	and seventy kopeks, and if she took those powders in boiled water at
 36089	intervals of precisely two hours, neither more nor less.
 36090	
 36091	What would SÃ³nya and the count and countess have done, how would they
 36092	have looked, if nothing had been done, if there had not been those pills
 36093	to give by the clock, the warm drinks, the chicken cutlets, and all the
 36094	other details of life ordered by the doctors, the carrying out of which
 36095	supplied an occupation and consolation to the family circle? How would
 36096	the count have borne his dearly loved daughterâs illness had he not
 36097	known that it was costing him a thousand rubles, and that he would not
 36098	grudge thousands more to benefit her, or had he not known that if her
 36099	illness continued he would not grudge yet other thousands and would take
 36100	her abroad for consultations there, and had he not been able to explain
 36101	the details of how MÃ©tivier and Feller had not understood the symptoms,
 36102	but Frise had, and MÃºdrov had diagnosed them even better? What would the
 36103	countess have done had she not been able sometimes to scold the invalid
 36104	for not strictly obeying the doctorâs orders?
 36105	
 36106	âYouâll never get well like that,â she would say, forgetting her grief
 36107	in her vexation, âif you wonât obey the doctor and take your medicine at
 36108	the right time! You mustnât trifle with it, you know, or it may turn to
 36109	pneumonia,â she would go on, deriving much comfort from the utterance of
 36110	that foreign word, incomprehensible to others as well as to herself.
 36111	
 36112	What would SÃ³nya have done without the glad consciousness that she had
 36113	not undressed during the first three nights, in order to be ready to
 36114	carry out all the doctorâs injunctions with precision, and that she
 36115	still kept awake at night so as not to miss the proper time when the
 36116	slightly harmful pills in the little gilt box had to be administered?
 36117	Even to NatÃ¡sha herself it was pleasant to see that so many sacrifices
 36118	were being made for her sake, and to know that she had to take medicine
 36119	at certain hours, though she declared that no medicine would cure her
 36120	and that it was all nonsense. And it was even pleasant to be able to
 36121	show, by disregarding the orders, that she did not believe in medical
 36122	treatment and did not value her life.
 36123	
 36124	The doctor came every day, felt her pulse, looked at her tongue, and
 36125	regardless of her grief-stricken face joked with her. But when he had
 36126	gone into another room, to which the countess hurriedly followed him, he
 36127	assumed a grave air and thoughtfully shaking his head said that though
 36128	there was danger, he had hopes of the effect of this last medicine and
 36129	one must wait and see, that the malady was chiefly mental, but... And
 36130	the countess, trying to conceal the action from herself and from him,
 36131	slipped a gold coin into his hand and always returned to the patient
 36132	with a more tranquil mind.
 36133	
 36134	The symptoms of NatÃ¡shaâs illness were that she ate little, slept
 36135	little, coughed, and was always low-spirited. The doctors said that
 36136	she could not get on without medical treatment, so they kept her in the
 36137	stifling atmosphere of the town, and the RostÃ³vs did not move to the
 36138	country that summer of 1812.
 36139	
 36140	In spite of the many pills she swallowed and the drops and powders out
 36141	of the little bottles and boxes of which Madame Schoss who was fond of
 36142	such things made a large collection, and in spite of being deprived of
 36143	the country life to which she was accustomed, youth prevailed. NatÃ¡shaâs
 36144	grief began to be overlaid by the impressions of daily life, it ceased
 36145	to press so painfully on her heart, it gradually faded into the past,
 36146	and she began to recover physically.
 36147

 36151	
 36152	CHAPTER XVII
 36153	
 36154	NatÃ¡sha was calmer but no happier. She not merely avoided all external
 36155	forms of pleasureâballs, promenades, concerts, and theatersâbut she
 36156	never laughed without a sound of tears in her laughter. She could not
 36157	sing. As soon as she began to laugh, or tried to sing by herself, tears
 36158	choked her: tears of remorse, tears at the recollection of those pure
 36159	times which could never return, tears of vexation that she should so
 36160	uselessly have ruined her young life which might have been so happy.
 36161	Laughter and singing in particular seemed to her like a blasphemy,
 36162	in face of her sorrow. Without any need of self-restraint, no wish to
 36163	coquet ever entered her head. She said and felt at that time that no
 36164	man was more to her than NastÃ¡sya IvÃ¡novna, the buffoon. Something stood
 36165	sentinel within her and forbade her every joy. Besides, she had lost all
 36166	the old interests of her carefree girlish life that had been so full
 36167	of hope. The previous autumn, the hunting, âUncle,â and the Christmas
 36168	holidays spent with Nicholas at OtrÃ¡dnoe were what she recalled oftenest
 36169	and most painfully. What would she not have given to bring back even a
 36170	single day of that time! But it was gone forever. Her presentiment at
 36171	the time had not deceived herâthat that state of freedom and readiness
 36172	for any enjoyment would not return again. Yet it was necessary to live
 36173	on.
 36174	
 36175	It comforted her to reflect that she was not better as she had formerly
 36176	imagined, but worse, much worse, than anybody else in the world. But
 36177	this was not enough. She knew that, and asked herself, âWhat next?â
 36178	But there was nothing to come. There was no joy in life, yet life was
 36179	passing. NatÃ¡sha apparently tried not to be a burden or a hindrance to
 36180	anyone, but wanted nothing for herself. She kept away from everyone in
 36181	the house and felt at ease only with her brother PÃ©tya. She liked to
 36182	be with him better than with the others, and when alone with him she
 36183	sometimes laughed. She hardly ever left the house and of those who came
 36184	to see them was glad to see only one person, Pierre. It would have been
 36185	impossible to treat her with more delicacy, greater care, and at the
 36186	same time more seriously than did Count BezÃºkhov. NatÃ¡sha unconsciously
 36187	felt this delicacy and so found great pleasure in his society. But
 36188	she was not even grateful to him for it; nothing good on Pierreâs part
 36189	seemed to her to be an effort, it seemed so natural for him to be kind
 36190	to everyone that there was no merit in his kindness. Sometimes NatÃ¡sha
 36191	noticed embarrassment and awkwardness on his part in her presence,
 36192	especially when he wanted to do something to please her, or feared that
 36193	something they spoke of would awaken memories distressing to her. She
 36194	noticed this and attributed it to his general kindness and shyness,
 36195	which she imagined must be the same toward everyone as it was to her.
 36196	After those involuntary wordsâthat if he were free he would have asked
 36197	on his knees for her hand and her loveâuttered at a moment when she was
 36198	so strongly agitated, Pierre never spoke to NatÃ¡sha of his feelings;
 36199	and it seemed plain to her that those words, which had then so comforted
 36200	her, were spoken as all sorts of meaningless words are spoken to comfort
 36201	a crying child. It was not because Pierre was a married man, but because
 36202	NatÃ¡sha felt very strongly with him that moral barrier the absence of
 36203	which she had experienced with KurÃ¡gin that it never entered her head
 36204	that the relations between him and herself could lead to love on her
 36205	part, still less on his, or even to the kind of tender, self-conscious,
 36206	romantic friendship between a man and a woman of which she had known
 36207	several instances.
 36208	
 36209	Before the end of the fast of St. Peter, AgrafÃ©na IvÃ¡novna BelÃ³va, a
 36210	country neighbor of the RostÃ³vs, came to Moscow to pay her devotions at
 36211	the shrines of the Moscow saints. She suggested that NatÃ¡sha should fast
 36212	and prepare for Holy Communion, and NatÃ¡sha gladly welcomed the idea.
 36213	Despite the doctorâs orders that she should not go out early in the
 36214	morning, NatÃ¡sha insisted on fasting and preparing for the sacrament,
 36215	not as they generally prepared for it in the RostÃ³v family by attending
 36216	three services in their own house, but as AgrafÃ©na IvÃ¡novna did, by
 36217	going to church every day for a week and not once missing Vespers,
 36218	Matins, or Mass.
 36219	
 36220	The countess was pleased with NatÃ¡shaâs zeal; after the poor results of
 36221	the medical treatment, in the depths of her heart she hoped that prayer
 36222	might help her daughter more than medicines and, though not without
 36223	fear and concealing it from the doctor, she agreed to NatÃ¡shaâs wish and
 36224	entrusted her to BelÃ³va. AgrafÃ©na IvÃ¡novna used to come to wake NatÃ¡sha
 36225	at three in the morning, but generally found her already awake. She was
 36226	afraid of being late for Matins. Hastily washing, and meekly putting on
 36227	her shabbiest dress and an old mantilla, NatÃ¡sha, shivering in the fresh
 36228	air, went out into the deserted streets lit by the clear light of dawn.
 36229	By AgrafÃ©na IvÃ¡novnaâs advice NatÃ¡sha prepared herself not in their
 36230	own parish, but at a church where, according to the devout AgrafÃ©na
 36231	IvÃ¡novna, the priest was a man of very severe and lofty life. There were
 36232	never many people in the church; NatÃ¡sha always stood beside BelÃ³va in
 36233	the customary place before an icon of the Blessed Virgin, let into the
 36234	screen before the choir on the left side, and a feeling, new to her, of
 36235	humility before something great and incomprehensible, seized her when
 36236	at that unusual morning hour, gazing at the dark face of the Virgin
 36237	illuminated by the candles burning before it and by the morning light
 36238	falling from the window, she listened to the words of the service which
 36239	she tried to follow with understanding. When she understood them her
 36240	personal feeling became interwoven in the prayers with shades of its
 36241	own. When she did not understand, it was sweeter still to think that
 36242	the wish to understand everything is pride, that it is impossible to
 36243	understand all, that it is only necessary to believe and to commit
 36244	oneself to God, whom she felt guiding her soul at those moments. She
 36245	crossed herself, bowed low, and when she did not understand, in horror
 36246	at her own vileness, simply asked God to forgive her everything,
 36247	everything, to have mercy upon her. The prayers to which she surrendered
 36248	herself most of all were those of repentance. On her way home at an
 36249	early hour when she met no one but bricklayers going to work or men
 36250	sweeping the street, and everybody within the houses was still asleep,
 36251	NatÃ¡sha experienced a feeling new to her, a sense of the possibility
 36252	of correcting her faults, the possibility of a new, clean life, and of
 36253	happiness.
 36254	
 36255	During the whole week she spent in this way, that feeling grew every
 36256	day. And the happiness of taking communion, or âcommuningâ as AgrafÃ©na
 36257	IvÃ¡novna, joyously playing with the word, called it, seemed to NatÃ¡sha
 36258	so great that she felt she should never live till that blessed Sunday.
 36259	
 36260	But the happy day came, and on that memorable Sunday, when, dressed in
 36261	white muslin, she returned home after communion, for the first time for
 36262	many months she felt calm and not oppressed by the thought of the life
 36263	that lay before her.
 36264	
 36265	The doctor who came to see her that day ordered her to continue the
 36266	powders he had prescribed a fortnight previously.
 36267	
 36268	âShe must certainly go on taking them morning and evening,â said
 36269	he, evidently sincerely satisfied with his success. âOnly, please be
 36270	particular about it.
 36271	
 36272	âBe quite easy,â he continued playfully, as he adroitly took the gold
 36273	coin in his palm. âShe will soon be singing and frolicking about. The
 36274	last medicine has done her a very great deal of good. She has freshened
 36275	up very much.â
 36276	
 36277	The countess, with a cheerful expression on her face, looked down at her
 36278	nails and spat a little for luck as she returned to the drawing room.
 36279	
 36280

 36283	
 36284	CHAPTER XVIII
 36285	
 36286	At the beginning of July more and more disquieting reports about the war
 36287	began to spread in Moscow; people spoke of an appeal by the Emperor to
 36288	the people, and of his coming himself from the army to Moscow. And as
 36289	up to the eleventh of July no manifesto or appeal had been received,
 36290	exaggerated reports became current about them and about the position of
 36291	Russia. It was said that the Emperor was leaving the army because it was
 36292	in danger, it was said that SmolÃ©nsk had surrendered, that Napoleon had
 36293	an army of a million and only a miracle could save Russia.
 36294	
 36295	On the eleventh of July, which was Saturday, the manifesto was received
 36296	but was not yet in print, and Pierre, who was at the RostÃ³vsâ, promised
 36297	to come to dinner next day, Sunday, and bring a copy of the manifesto
 36298	and appeal, which he would obtain from Count RostopchÃ­n.
 36299	
 36300	That Sunday, the RostÃ³vs went to Mass at the RazumÃ³vskisâ private chapel
 36301	as usual. It was a hot July day. Even at ten oâclock, when the RostÃ³vs
 36302	got out of their carriage at the chapel, the sultry air, the shouts of
 36303	hawkers, the light and gay summer clothes of the crowd, the dusty leaves
 36304	of the trees on the boulevard, the sounds of the band and the white
 36305	trousers of a battalion marching to parade, the rattling of wheels on
 36306	the cobblestones, and the brilliant, hot sunshine were all full of that
 36307	summer languor, that content and discontent with the present, which
 36308	is most strongly felt on a bright, hot day in town. All the Moscow
 36309	notabilities, all the RostÃ³vsâ acquaintances, were at the RazumÃ³vskisâ
 36310	chapel, for, as if expecting something to happen, many wealthy families
 36311	who usually left town for their country estates had not gone away that
 36312	summer. As NatÃ¡sha, at her motherâs side, passed through the crowd
 36313	behind a liveried footman who cleared the way for them, she heard a
 36314	young man speaking about her in too loud a whisper.
 36315	
 36316	âThatâs RostÃ³va, the one who...â
 36317	
 36318	âSheâs much thinner, but all the same sheâs pretty!â
 36319	
 36320	She heard, or thought she heard, the names of KurÃ¡gin and BolkÃ³nski. But
 36321	she was always imagining that. It always seemed to her that everyone
 36322	who looked at her was thinking only of what had happened to her. With a
 36323	sinking heart, wretched as she always was now when she found herself
 36324	in a crowd, NatÃ¡sha in her lilac silk dress trimmed with black lace
 36325	walkedâas women can walkâwith the more repose and stateliness the
 36326	greater the pain and shame in her soul. She knew for certain that she
 36327	was pretty, but this no longer gave her satisfaction as it used to.
 36328	On the contrary it tormented her more than anything else of late, and
 36329	particularly so on this bright, hot summer day in town. âItâs Sunday
 36330	againâanother week past,â she thought, recalling that she had been here
 36331	the Sunday before, âand always the same life that is no life, and the
 36332	same surroundings in which it used to be so easy to live. Iâm pretty,
 36333	Iâm young, and I know that now I am good. I used to be bad, but now I
 36334	know I am good,â she thought, âbut yet my best years are slipping by
 36335	and are no good to anyone.â She stood by her motherâs side and exchanged
 36336	nods with acquaintances near her. From habit she scrutinized the ladiesâ
 36337	dresses, condemned the bearing of a lady standing close by who was not
 36338	crossing herself properly but in a cramped manner, and again she thought
 36339	with vexation that she was herself being judged and was judging others,
 36340	and suddenly, at the sound of the service, she felt horrified at her own
 36341	vileness, horrified that the former purity of her soul was again lost to
 36342	her.
 36343	
 36344	A comely, fresh-looking old man was conducting the service with that
 36345	mild solemnity which has so elevating and soothing an effect on the
 36346	souls of the worshipers. The gates of the sanctuary screen were closed,
 36347	the curtain was slowly drawn, and from behind it a soft mysterious voice
 36348	pronounced some words. Tears, the cause of which she herself did not
 36349	understand, made NatÃ¡shaâs breast heave, and a joyous but oppressive
 36350	feeling agitated her.
 36351	
 36352	âTeach me what I should do, how to live my life, how I may grow good
 36353	forever, forever!â she pleaded.
 36354	
 36355	The deacon came out onto the raised space before the altar screen and,
 36356	holding his thumb extended, drew his long hair from under his dalmatic
 36357	and, making the sign of the cross on his breast, began in a loud and
 36358	solemn voice to recite the words of the prayer....
 36359	
 36360	âIn peace let us pray unto the Lord.â
 36361	
 36362	âAs one community, without distinction of class, without enmity, united
 36363	by brotherly loveâlet us pray!â thought NatÃ¡sha.
 36364	
 36365	âFor the peace that is from above, and for the salvation of our souls.â
 36366	
 36367	âFor the world of angels and all the spirits who dwell above us,â prayed
 36368	NatÃ¡sha.
 36369	
 36370	When they prayed for the warriors, she thought of her brother and
 36371	DenÃ­sov. When they prayed for all traveling by land and sea, she
 36372	remembered Prince Andrew, prayed for him, and asked God to forgive her
 36373	all the wrongs she had done him. When they prayed for those who love us,
 36374	she prayed for the members of her own family, her father and mother and
 36375	SÃ³nya, realizing for the first time how wrongly she had acted toward
 36376	them, and feeling all the strength of her love for them. When they
 36377	prayed for those who hate us, she tried to think of her enemies and
 36378	people who hated her, in order to pray for them. She included among her
 36379	enemies the creditors and all who had business dealings with her
 36380	father, and always at the thought of enemies and those who hated her she
 36381	remembered Anatole who had done her so much harmâand though he did not
 36382	hate her she gladly prayed for him as for an enemy. Only at prayer did
 36383	she feel able to think clearly and calmly of Prince Andrew and Anatole,
 36384	as men for whom her feelings were as nothing compared with her awe and
 36385	devotion to God. When they prayed for the Imperial family and the Synod,
 36386	she bowed very low and made the sign of the cross, saying to herself
 36387	that even if she did not understand, still she could not doubt, and at
 36388	any rate loved the governing Synod and prayed for it.
 36389	
 36390	When he had finished the Litany the deacon crossed the stole over his
 36391	breast and said, âLet us commit ourselves and our whole lives to Christ
 36392	the Lord!â
 36393	
 36394	âCommit ourselves to God,â NatÃ¡sha inwardly repeated. âLord God, I
 36395	submit myself to Thy will!â she thought. âI want nothing, wish for
 36396	nothing; teach me what to do and how to use my will! Take me, take
 36397	me!â prayed NatÃ¡sha, with impatient emotion in her heart, not crossing
 36398	herself but letting her slender arms hang down as if expecting some
 36399	invisible power at any moment to take her and deliver her from herself,
 36400	from her regrets, desires, remorse, hopes, and sins.
 36401	
 36402	The countess looked round several times at her daughterâs softened face
 36403	and shining eyes and prayed God to help her.
 36404	
 36405	Unexpectedly, in the middle of the service, and not in the usual order
 36406	NatÃ¡sha knew so well, the deacon brought out a small stool, the one he
 36407	knelt on when praying on Trinity Sunday, and placed it before the doors
 36408	of the sanctuary screen. The priest came out with his purple velvet
 36409	biretta on his head, adjusted his hair, and knelt down with an effort.
 36410	Everybody followed his example and they looked at one another in
 36411	surprise. Then came the prayer just received from the Synodâa prayer for
 36412	the deliverance of Russia from hostile invasion.
 36413	
 36414	âLord God of might, God of our salvation!â began the priest in that
 36415	voice, clear, not grandiloquent but mild, in which only the Slav clergy
 36416	read and which acts so irresistibly on a Russian heart.
 36417	
 36418	âLord God of might, God of our salvation! Look this day in mercy and
 36419	blessing on Thy humble people, and graciously hear us, spare us, and
 36420	have mercy upon us! This foe confounding Thy land, desiring to lay
 36421	waste the whole world, rises against us; these lawless men are gathered
 36422	together to overthrow Thy kingdom, to destroy Thy dear Jerusalem, Thy
 36423	beloved Russia; to defile Thy temples, to overthrow Thine altars, and to
 36424	desecrate our holy shrines. How long, O Lord, how long shall the wicked
 36425	triumph? How long shall they wield unlawful power?
 36426	
 36427	âLord God! Hear us when we pray to Thee; strengthen with Thy might
 36428	our most gracious sovereign lord, the Emperor Alexander PÃ¡vlovich; be
 36429	mindful of his uprightness and meekness, reward him according to his
 36430	righteousness, and let it preserve us, Thy chosen Israel! Bless his
 36431	counsels, his undertakings, and his work; strengthen his kingdom by
 36432	Thine almighty hand, and give him victory over his enemy, even as Thou
 36433	gavest Moses the victory over Amalek, Gideon over Midian, and David over
 36434	Goliath. Preserve his army, put a bow of brass in the hands of those who
 36435	have armed themselves in Thy Name, and gird their loins with strength
 36436	for the fight. Take up the spear and shield and arise to help us;
 36437	confound and put to shame those who have devised evil against us, may
 36438	they be before the faces of Thy faithful warriors as dust before the
 36439	wind, and may Thy mighty Angel confound them and put them to flight; may
 36440	they be ensnared when they know it not, and may the plots they have laid
 36441	in secret be turned against them; let them fall before Thy servantsâ
 36442	feet and be laid low by our hosts! Lord, Thou art able to save both
 36443	great and small; Thou art God, and man cannot prevail against Thee!
 36444	
 36445	âGod of our fathers! Remember Thy bounteous mercy and loving-kindness
 36446	which are from of old; turn not Thy face from us, but be gracious to our
 36447	unworthiness, and in Thy great goodness and Thy many mercies regard not
 36448	our transgressions and iniquities! Create in us a clean heart and renew
 36449	a right spirit within us, strengthen us all in Thy faith, fortify our
 36450	hope, inspire us with true love one for another, arm us with unity of
 36451	spirit in the righteous defense of the heritage Thou gavest to us and
 36452	to our fathers, and let not the scepter of the wicked be exalted against
 36453	the destiny of those Thou hast sanctified.
 36454	
 36455	âO Lord our God, in whom we believe and in whom we put our trust, let us
 36456	not be confounded in our hope of Thy mercy, and give us a token of Thy
 36457	blessing, that those who hate us and our Orthodox faith may see it and
 36458	be put to shame and perish, and may all the nations know that Thou art
 36459	the Lord and we are Thy people. Show Thy mercy upon us this day, O Lord,
 36460	and grant us Thy salvation; make the hearts of Thy servants to rejoice
 36461	in Thy mercy; smite down our enemies and destroy them swiftly beneath
 36462	the feet of Thy faithful servants! For Thou art the defense, the succor,
 36463	and the victory of them that put their trust in Thee, and to Thee be all
 36464	glory, to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, now and forever, world without
 36465	end. Amen.â
 36466	
 36467	In NatÃ¡shaâs receptive condition of soul this prayer affected her
 36468	strongly. She listened to every word about the victory of Moses over
 36469	Amalek, of Gideon over Midian, and of David over Goliath, and about
 36470	the destruction of âThy Jerusalem,â and she prayed to God with the
 36471	tenderness and emotion with which her heart was overflowing, but without
 36472	fully understanding what she was asking of God in that prayer. She
 36473	shared with all her heart in the prayer for the spirit of righteousness,
 36474	for the strengthening of the heart by faith and hope, and its animation
 36475	by love. But she could not pray that her enemies might be trampled under
 36476	foot when but a few minutes before she had been wishing she had more
 36477	of them that she might pray for them. But neither could she doubt the
 36478	righteousness of the prayer that was being read on bended knees. She
 36479	felt in her heart a devout and tremulous awe at the thought of the
 36480	punishment that overtakes men for their sins, and especially of her own
 36481	sins, and she prayed to God to forgive them all, and her too, and to
 36482	give them all, and her too, peace and happiness. And it seemed to her
 36483	that God heard her prayer.

 36489	CHAPTER XIX
 36490	
 36491	From the day when Pierre, after leaving the RostÃ³vsâ with NatÃ¡shaâs
 36492	grateful look fresh in his mind, had gazed at the comet that seemed to
 36493	be fixed in the sky and felt that something new was appearing on his own
 36494	horizonâfrom that day the problem of the vanity and uselessness of all
 36495	earthly things, that had incessantly tormented him, no longer presented
 36496	itself. That terrible question âWhy?â âWherefore?â which had come to him
 36497	amid every occupation, was now replaced, not by another question or by a
 36498	reply to the former question, but by her image. When he listened to, or
 36499	himself took part in, trivial conversations, when he read or heard of
 36500	human baseness or folly, he was not horrified as formerly, and did
 36501	not ask himself why men struggled so about these things when all is so
 36502	transient and incomprehensibleâbut he remembered her as he had last
 36503	seen her, and all his doubts vanishedânot because she had answered
 36504	the questions that had haunted him, but because his conception of her
 36505	transferred him instantly to another, a brighter, realm of spiritual
 36506	activity in which no one could be justified or guiltyâa realm of beauty
 36507	and love which it was worth living for. Whatever worldly baseness
 36508	presented itself to him, he said to himself:
 36509	
 36510	âWell, supposing N. N. has swindled the country and the Tsar, and the
 36511	country and the Tsar confer honors upon him, what does that matter? She
 36512	smiled at me yesterday and asked me to come again, and I love her, and
 36513	no one will ever know it.â And his soul felt calm and peaceful.
 36514	
 36515	Pierre still went into society, drank as much and led the same idle
 36516	and dissipated life, because besides the hours he spent at the RostÃ³vsâ
 36517	there were other hours he had to spend somehow, and the habits and
 36518	acquaintances he had made in Moscow formed a current that bore him along
 36519	irresistibly. But latterly, when more and more disquieting reports came
 36520	from the seat of war and NatÃ¡shaâs health began to improve and she
 36521	no longer aroused in him the former feeling of careful pity, an
 36522	ever-increasing restlessness, which he could not explain, took
 36523	possession of him. He felt that the condition he was in could not
 36524	continue long, that a catastrophe was coming which would change his
 36525	whole life, and he impatiently sought everywhere for signs of that
 36526	approaching catastrophe. One of his brother Masons had revealed to
 36527	Pierre the following prophecy concerning Napoleon, drawn from the
 36528	Revelation of St. John.
 36529	
 36530	In chapter 13, verse 18, of the Apocalypse, it is said:
 36531	
 36532	Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of
 36533	the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred
 36534	threescore and six.
 36535	
 36536	And in the fifth verse of the same chapter:
 36537	
 36538	And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and
 36539	blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two
 36540	months.
 36541	
 36542	
 36543	The French alphabet, written out with the same numerical values as the
 36544	Hebrew, in which the first nine letters denote units and the others
 36545	tens, will have the following significance:
 36546	
 36547	      a   b   c   d   e   f   g   h   i   k
 36548	      1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10
 36549	       l    m    n    o    p    q    r    s
 36550	      20   30   40   50   60   70   80   90
 36551	             t    u    v    w    x    y
 36552	            100  110  120  130  140  150
 36553	                        z
 36554	                       160
 36555	
 36556	Writing the words LâEmpereur NapolÃ©on in numbers, it appears that the
 36557	sum of them is 666, and that Napoleon was therefore the beast foretold
 36558	in the Apocalypse. Moreover, by applying the same system to the words
 36559	quarante-deux, * which was the term allowed to the beast that âspoke
 36560	great things and blasphemies,â the same number 666 was obtained; from
 36561	which it followed that the limit fixed for Napoleonâs power had come
 36562	in the year 1812 when the French emperor was forty-two. This prophecy
 36563	pleased Pierre very much and he often asked himself what would put an
 36564	end to the power of the beast, that is, of Napoleon, and tried by the
 36565	same system of using letters as numbers and adding them up, to find an
 36566	answer to the question that engrossed him. He wrote the words LâEmpereur
 36567	Alexandre, La nation russe and added up their numbers, but the sums
 36568	were either more or less than 666. Once when making such calculations he
 36569	wrote down his own name in French, Comte Pierre Besouhoff, but the
 36570	sum of the numbers did not come right. Then he changed the spelling,
 36571	substituting a z for the s and adding de and the article le, still
 36572	without obtaining the desired result. Then it occurred to him: if the
 36573	answer to the question were contained in his name, his nationality would
 36574	also be given in the answer. So he wrote Le russe Besuhof and adding
 36575	up the numbers got 671. This was only five too much, and five was
 36576	represented by e, the very letter elided from the article le before the
 36577	word Empereur. By omitting the e, though incorrectly, Pierre got the
 36578	answer he sought. Lârusse Besuhof made 666. This discovery excited him.
 36579	How, or by what means, he was connected with the great event foretold in
 36580	the Apocalypse he did not know, but he did not doubt that connection for
 36581	a moment. His love for NatÃ¡sha, Antichrist, Napoleon, the invasion, the
 36582	comet, 666, LâEmpereur NapolÃ©on, and Lârusse Besuhofâall this had to
 36583	mature and culminate, to lift him out of that spellbound, petty sphere
 36584	of Moscow habits in which he felt himself held captive and lead him to a
 36585	great achievement and great happiness.
 36586	
 36587	    * Forty-two.
 36588	
 36589	
 36590	On the eve of the Sunday when the special prayer was read, Pierre had
 36591	promised the RostÃ³vs to bring them, from Count RostopchÃ­n whom he knew
 36592	well, both the appeal to the people and the news from the army. In the
 36593	morning, when he went to call at RostopchÃ­nâs he met there a courier
 36594	fresh from the army, an acquaintance of his own, who often danced at
 36595	Moscow balls.
 36596	
 36597	âDo, please, for heavenâs sake, relieve me of something!â said the
 36598	courier. âI have a sackful of letters to parents.â
 36599	
 36600	Among these letters was one from Nicholas RostÃ³v to his father. Pierre
 36601	took that letter, and RostopchÃ­n also gave him the Emperorâs appeal to
 36602	Moscow, which had just been printed, the last army orders, and his own
 36603	most recent bulletin. Glancing through the army orders, Pierre found in
 36604	one of them, in the lists of killed, wounded, and rewarded, the name of
 36605	Nicholas RostÃ³v, awarded a St. Georgeâs Cross of the Fourth Class for
 36606	courage shown in the OstrÃ³vna affair, and in the same order the name
 36607	of Prince Andrew BolkÃ³nski, appointed to the command of a regiment of
 36608	Chasseurs. Though he did not want to remind the RostÃ³vs of BolkÃ³nski,
 36609	Pierre could not refrain from making them happy by the news of their
 36610	sonâs having received a decoration, so he sent that printed army order
 36611	and Nicholasâ letter to the RostÃ³vs, keeping the appeal, the bulletin,
 36612	and the other orders to take with him when he went to dinner.
 36613	
 36614	His conversation with Count RostopchÃ­n and the latterâs tone of anxious
 36615	hurry, the meeting with the courier who talked casually of how badly
 36616	things were going in the army, the rumors of the discovery of spies in
 36617	Moscow and of a leaflet in circulation stating that Napoleon promised
 36618	to be in both the Russian capitals by the autumn, and the talk of the
 36619	Emperorâs being expected to arrive next dayâall aroused with fresh force
 36620	that feeling of agitation and expectation in Pierre which he had been
 36621	conscious of ever since the appearance of the comet, and especially
 36622	since the beginning of the war.
 36623	
 36624	He had long been thinking of entering the army and would have done so
 36625	had he not been hindered, first, by his membership of the Society of
 36626	Freemasons to which he was bound by oath and which preached perpetual
 36627	peace and the abolition of war, and secondly, by the fact that when he
 36628	saw the great mass of Muscovites who had donned uniform and were talking
 36629	patriotism, he somehow felt ashamed to take the step. But the chief
 36630	reason for not carrying out his intention to enter the army lay in the
 36631	vague idea that he was Lârusse Besuhof who had the number of the beast,
 36632	666; that his part in the great affair of setting a limit to the
 36633	power of the beast that spoke great and blasphemous things had been
 36634	predestined from eternity, and that therefore he ought not to undertake
 36635	anything, but wait for what was bound to come to pass.
 36636	
 36637	
 36638	
 36639	
 36640	
 36641	CHAPTER XX
 36642	
 36643	A few intimate friends were dining with the RostÃ³vs that day, as usual
 36644	on Sundays.
 36645	
 36646	Pierre came early so as to find them alone.
 36647	
 36648	He had grown so stout this year that he would have been abnormal had he
 36649	not been so tall, so broad of limb, and so strong that he carried his
 36650	bulk with evident ease.
 36651	
 36652	He went up the stairs, puffing and muttering something. His coachman did
 36653	not even ask whether he was to wait. He knew that when his master was
 36654	at the RostÃ³vsâ he stayed till midnight. The RostÃ³vsâ footman rushed
 36655	eagerly forward to help him off with his cloak and take his hat and
 36656	stick. Pierre, from club habit, always left both hat and stick in the
 36657	anteroom.
 36658	
 36659	The first person he saw in the house was NatÃ¡sha. Even before he saw
 36660	her, while taking off his cloak, he heard her. She was practicing solfa
 36661	exercises in the music room. He knew that she had not sung since her
 36662	illness, and so the sound of her voice surprised and delighted him. He
 36663	opened the door softly and saw her, in the lilac dress she had worn at
 36664	church, walking about the room singing. She had her back to him when he
 36665	opened the door, but when, turning quickly, she saw his broad, surprised
 36666	face, she blushed and came rapidly up to him.
 36667	
 36668	âI want to try to sing again,â she said, adding as if by way of excuse,
 36669	âit is, at least, something to do.â
 36670	
 36671	âThatâs capital!â
 36672	
 36673	âHow glad I am youâve come! I am so happy today,â she said, with the old
 36674	animation Pierre had not seen in her for a long time. âYou know Nicholas
 36675	has received a St. Georgeâs Cross? I am so proud of him.â
 36676	
 36677	âOh yes, I sent that announcement. But I donât want to interrupt you,â
 36678	he added, and was about to go to the drawing room.
 36679	
 36680	NatÃ¡sha stopped him.
 36681	
 36682	âCount, is it wrong of me to sing?â she said blushing, and fixing her
 36683	eyes inquiringly on him.
 36684	
 36685	âNo... Why should it be? On the contrary... But why do you ask me?â
 36686	
 36687	âI donât know myself,â NatÃ¡sha answered quickly, âbut I should not like
 36688	to do anything you disapproved of. I believe in you completely. You
 36689	donât know how important you are to me, how much youâve done for me....â
 36690	She spoke rapidly and did not notice how Pierre flushed at her words. âI
 36691	saw in that same army order that he, BolkÃ³nskiâ (she whispered the name
 36692	hastily), âis in Russia, and in the army again. What do you think?ââshe
 36693	was speaking hurriedly, evidently afraid her strength might fail
 36694	herââWill he ever forgive me? Will he not always have a bitter feeling
 36695	toward me? What do you think? What do you think?â
 36696	
 36697	âI think...â Pierre replied, âthat he has nothing to forgive.... If I
 36698	were in his place...â
 36699	
 36700	By association of ideas, Pierre was at once carried back to the day
 36701	when, trying to comfort her, he had said that if he were not himself but
 36702	the best man in the world and free, he would ask on his knees for her
 36703	hand; and the same feeling of pity, tenderness, and love took possession
 36704	of him and the same words rose to his lips. But she did not give him
 36705	time to say them.
 36706	
 36707	âYes, you... you...â she said, uttering the word you rapturouslyââthatâs
 36708	a different thing. I know no one kinder, more generous, or better than
 36709	you; nobody could be! Had you not been there then, and now too, I donât
 36710	know what would have become of me, because...â
 36711	
 36712	Tears suddenly rose in her eyes, she turned away, lifted her music
 36713	before her eyes, began singing again, and again began walking up and
 36714	down the room.
 36715	
 36716	Just then PÃ©tya came running in from the drawing room.
 36717	
 36718	PÃ©tya was now a handsome rosy lad of fifteen with full red lips and
 36719	resembled NatÃ¡sha. He was preparing to enter the university, but he and
 36720	his friend ObolÃ©nski had lately, in secret, agreed to join the hussars.
 36721	
 36722	PÃ©tya had come rushing out to talk to his namesake about this affair.
 36723	He had asked Pierre to find out whether he would be accepted in the
 36724	hussars.
 36725	
 36726	Pierre walked up and down the drawing room, not listening to what PÃ©tya
 36727	was saying.
 36728	
 36729	PÃ©tya pulled him by the arm to attract his attention.
 36730	
 36731	âWell, what about my plan? Peter KirÃ­lych, for heavenâs sake! You are my
 36732	only hope,â said PÃ©tya.
 36733	
 36734	âOh yes, your plan. To join the hussars? Iâll mention it, Iâll bring it
 36735	all up today.â
 36736	
 36737	âWell, mon cher, have you got the manifesto?â asked the old count. âThe
 36738	countess has been to Mass at the RazumÃ³vskisâ and heard the new prayer.
 36739	She says itâs very fine.â
 36740	
 36741	âYes, Iâve got it,â said Pierre. âThe Emperor is to be here tomorrow...
 36742	thereâs to be an Extraordinary Meeting of the nobility, and they are
 36743	talking of a levy of ten men per thousand. Oh yes, let me congratulate
 36744	you!â
 36745	
 36746	âYes, yes, thank God! Well, and what news from the army?â
 36747	
 36748	âWe are again retreating. They say weâre already near SmolÃ©nsk,â replied
 36749	Pierre.
 36750	
 36751	âO Lord, O Lord!â exclaimed the count. âWhere is the manifesto?â
 36752	
 36753	âThe Emperorâs appeal? Oh yes!â
 36754	
 36755	Pierre began feeling in his pockets for the papers, but could not find
 36756	them. Still slapping his pockets, he kissed the hand of the countess
 36757	who entered the room and glanced uneasily around, evidently expecting
 36758	NatÃ¡sha, who had left off singing but had not yet come into the drawing
 36759	room.
 36760	
 36761	âOn my word, I donât know what Iâve done with it,â he said.
 36762	
 36763	âThere he is, always losing everything!â remarked the countess.
 36764	
 36765	NatÃ¡sha entered with a softened and agitated expression of face and
 36766	sat down looking silently at Pierre. As soon as she entered, Pierreâs
 36767	features, which had been gloomy, suddenly lighted up, and while still
 36768	searching for the papers he glanced at her several times.
 36769	
 36770	âNo, really! Iâll drive home, I must have left them there. Iâll
 36771	certainly...â
 36772	
 36773	âBut youâll be late for dinner.â
 36774	
 36775	âOh! And my coachman has gone.â
 36776	
 36777	But SÃ³nya, who had gone to look for the papers in the anteroom, had
 36778	found them in Pierreâs hat, where he had carefully tucked them under the
 36779	lining. Pierre was about to begin reading.
 36780	
 36781	âNo, after dinner,â said the old count, evidently expecting much
 36782	enjoyment from that reading.
 36783	
 36784	At dinner, at which champagne was drunk to the health of the new
 36785	chevalier of St. George, ShinshÃ­n told them the town news, of the
 36786	illness of the old Georgian princess, of MÃ©tivierâs disappearance from
 36787	Moscow, and of how some German fellow had been brought to RostopchÃ­n
 36788	and accused of being a French âspyerâ (so Count RostopchÃ­n had told the
 36789	story), and how RostopchÃ­n let him go and assured the people that he was
 36790	ânot a spire at all, but only an old German ruin.â
 36791	
 36792	âPeople are being arrested...â said the count. âIâve told the countess
 36793	she should not speak French so much. Itâs not the time for it now.â
 36794	
 36795	âAnd have you heard?â ShinshÃ­n asked. âPrince GolÃ­tsyn has engaged a
 36796	master to teach him Russian. It is becoming dangerous to speak French in
 36797	the streets.â
 36798	
 36799	âAnd how about you, Count Peter KirÃ­lych? If they call up the militia,
 36800	you too will have to mount a horse,â remarked the old count, addressing
 36801	Pierre.
 36802	
 36803	Pierre had been silent and preoccupied all through dinner, seeming not
 36804	to grasp what was said. He looked at the count.
 36805	
 36806	âOh yes, the war,â he said. âNo! What sort of warrior should I make? And
 36807	yet everything is so strange, so strange! I canât make it out. I donât
 36808	know, I am very far from having military tastes, but in these times no
 36809	one can answer for himself.â
 36810	
 36811	After dinner the count settled himself comfortably in an easy chair and
 36812	with a serious face asked SÃ³nya, who was considered an excellent reader,
 36813	to read the appeal.
 36814	
 36815	âTo Moscow, our ancient Capital!
 36816	
 36817	âThe enemy has entered the borders of Russia with immense forces. He
 36818	comes to despoil our beloved country.â
 36819	
 36820	SÃ³nya read painstakingly in her high-pitched voice. The count listened
 36821	with closed eyes, heaving abrupt sighs at certain passages.
 36822	
 36823	NatÃ¡sha sat erect, gazing with a searching look now at her father and
 36824	now at Pierre.
 36825	
 36826	Pierre felt her eyes on him and tried not to look round. The countess
 36827	shook her head disapprovingly and angrily at every solemn expression
 36828	in the manifesto. In all these words she saw only that the danger
 36829	threatening her son would not soon be over. ShinshÃ­n, with a sarcastic
 36830	smile on his lips, was evidently preparing to make fun of anything that
 36831	gave him the opportunity: SÃ³nyaâs reading, any remark of the countâs, or
 36832	even the manifesto itself should no better pretext present itself.
 36833	
 36834	After reading about the dangers that threatened Russia, the hopes the
 36835	Emperor placed on Moscow and especially on its illustrious nobility,
 36836	SÃ³nya, with a quiver in her voice due chiefly to the attention that was
 36837	being paid to her, read the last words:
 36838	
 36839	âWe ourselves will not delay to appear among our people in that Capital
 36840	and in other parts of our realm for consultation, and for the direction
 36841	of all our levies, both those now barring the enemyâs path and those
 36842	freshly formed to defeat him wherever he may appear. May the ruin he
 36843	hopes to bring upon us recoil on his own head, and may Europe delivered
 36844	from bondage glorify the name of Russia!â
 36845	
 36846	
 36847	âYes, thatâs it!â cried the count, opening his moist eyes and sniffing
 36848	repeatedly, as if a strong vinaigrette had been held to his nose; and he
 36849	added, âLet the Emperor but say the word and weâll sacrifice everything
 36850	and begrudge nothing.â
 36851	
 36852	Before ShinshÃ­n had time to utter the joke he was ready to make on the
 36853	countâs patriotism, NatÃ¡sha jumped up from her place and ran to her
 36854	father.
 36855	
 36856	âWhat a darling our Papa is!â she cried, kissing him, and she again
 36857	looked at Pierre with the unconscious coquetry that had returned to her
 36858	with her better spirits.
 36859	
 36860	âThere! Hereâs a patriot for you!â said ShinshÃ­n.
 36861	
 36862	âNot a patriot at all, but simply...â NatÃ¡sha replied in an injured
 36863	tone. âEverything seems funny to you, but this isnât at all a joke....â
 36864	
 36865	âA joke indeed!â put in the count. âLet him but say the word and weâll
 36866	all go.... Weâre not Germans!â
 36867	
 36868	âBut did you notice, it says, âfor consultationâ?â said Pierre.
 36869	
 36870	âNever mind what itâs for....â
 36871	
 36872	At this moment, PÃ©tya, to whom nobody was paying any attention, came up
 36873	to his father with a very flushed face and said in his breaking voice
 36874	that was now deep and now shrill:
 36875	
 36876	âWell, Papa, I tell you definitely, and Mamma too, itâs as you please,
 36877	but I say definitely that you must let me enter the army, because I
 36878	canât... thatâs all....â
 36879	
 36880	The countess, in dismay, looked up to heaven, clasped her hands, and
 36881	turned angrily to her husband.
 36882	
 36883	âThat comes of your talking!â said she.
 36884	
 36885	But the count had already recovered from his excitement.
 36886	
 36887	âCome, come!â said he. âHereâs a fine warrior! No! Nonsense! You must
 36888	study.â
 36889	
 36890	âItâs not nonsense, Papa. FÃ©dya ObolÃ©nski is younger than I, and heâs
 36891	going too. Besides, all the same I canât study now when...â PÃ©tya
 36892	stopped short, flushed till he perspired, but still got out the words,
 36893	âwhen our Fatherland is in danger.â
 36894	
 36895	âThatâll do, thatâll doânonsense....â
 36896	
 36897	âBut you said yourself that we would sacrifice everything.â
 36898	
 36899	âPÃ©tya! Be quiet, I tell you!â cried the count, with a glance at his
 36900	wife, who had turned pale and was staring fixedly at her son.
 36901	
 36902	âAnd I tell youâPeter KirÃ­lych here will also tell you...â
 36903	
 36904	âNonsense, I tell you. Your motherâs milk has hardly dried on your lips
 36905	and you want to go into the army! There, there, I tell you,â and the
 36906	count moved to go out of the room, taking the papers, probably to reread
 36907	them in his study before having a nap.
 36908	
 36909	âWell, Peter KirÃ­lych, letâs go and have a smoke,â he said.
 36910	
 36911	Pierre was agitated and undecided. NatÃ¡shaâs unwontedly brilliant eyes,
 36912	continually glancing at him with a more than cordial look, had reduced
 36913	him to this condition.
 36914	
 36915	âNo, I think Iâll go home.â
 36916	
 36917	âHome? Why, you meant to spend the evening with us.... You donât
 36918	often come nowadays as it is, and this girl of mine,â said the count
 36919	good-naturedly, pointing to NatÃ¡sha, âonly brightens up when youâre
 36920	here.â
 36921	
 36922	âYes, I had forgotten... I really must go home... business...â said
 36923	Pierre hurriedly.
 36924	
 36925	âWell, then, au revoir!â said the count, and went out of the room.
 36926	
 36927	âWhy are you going? Why are you upset?â asked NatÃ¡sha, and she looked
 36928	challengingly into Pierreâs eyes.
 36929	
 36930	âBecause I love you!â was what he wanted to say, but he did not say it,
 36931	and only blushed till the tears came, and lowered his eyes.
 36932	
 36933	âBecause it is better for me to come less often... because... No, simply
 36934	I have business....â
 36935	
 36936	âWhy? No, tell me!â NatÃ¡sha began resolutely and suddenly stopped.
 36937	
 36938	They looked at each other with dismayed and embarrassed faces. He tried
 36939	to smile but could not: his smile expressed suffering, and he silently
 36940	kissed her hand and went out.
 36941	
 36942	Pierre made up his mind not to go to the RostÃ³vsâ any more.
 36943	
 36944	
 36945	
 36946	
 36947	
 36948	CHAPTER XXI
 36949	
 36950	After the definite refusal he had received, PÃ©tya went to his room
 36951	and there locked himself in and wept bitterly. When he came in to tea,
 36952	silent, morose, and with tear-stained face, everybody pretended not to
 36953	notice anything.
 36954	
 36955	Next day the Emperor arrived in Moscow, and several of the RostÃ³vsâ
 36956	domestic serfs begged permission to go to have a look at him. That
 36957	morning PÃ©tya was a long time dressing and arranging his hair and
 36958	collar to look like a grown-up man. He frowned before his looking glass,
 36959	gesticulated, shrugged his shoulders, and finally, without saying a word
 36960	to anyone, took his cap and left the house by the back door, trying to
 36961	avoid notice. PÃ©tya decided to go straight to where the Emperor was and
 36962	to explain frankly to some gentleman-in-waiting (he imagined the Emperor
 36963	to be always surrounded by gentlemen-in-waiting) that he, Count RostÃ³v,
 36964	in spite of his youth wished to serve his country; that youth could be
 36965	no hindrance to loyalty, and that he was ready to... While
 36966	dressing, PÃ©tya had prepared many fine things he meant to say to the
 36967	gentleman-in-waiting.
 36968	
 36969	It was on the very fact of being so young that PÃ©tya counted for success
 36970	in reaching the Emperorâhe even thought how surprised everyone would be
 36971	at his youthfulnessâand yet in the arrangement of his collar and hair
 36972	and by his sedate deliberate walk he wished to appear a grown-up man.
 36973	But the farther he went and the more his attention was diverted by the
 36974	ever-increasing crowds moving toward the KrÃ©mlin, the less he remembered
 36975	to walk with the sedateness and deliberation of a man. As he approached
 36976	the KrÃ©mlin he even began to avoid being crushed and resolutely stuck
 36977	out his elbows in a menacing way. But within the Trinity Gateway he
 36978	was so pressed to the wall by people who probably were unaware of the
 36979	patriotic intentions with which he had come that in spite of all his
 36980	determination he had to give in, and stop while carriages passed in,
 36981	rumbling beneath the archway. Beside PÃ©tya stood a peasant woman, a
 36982	footman, two tradesmen, and a discharged soldier. After standing some
 36983	time in the gateway, PÃ©tya tried to move forward in front of the others
 36984	without waiting for all the carriages to pass, and he began resolutely
 36985	working his way with his elbows, but the woman just in front of him, who
 36986	was the first against whom he directed his efforts, angrily shouted at
 36987	him:
 36988	
 36989	âWhat are you shoving for, young lordling? Donât you see weâre all
 36990	standing still? Then why push?â
 36991	
 36992	âAnybody can shove,â said the footman, and also began working his elbows
 36993	to such effect that he pushed PÃ©tya into a very filthy corner of the
 36994	gateway.
 36995	
 36996	PÃ©tya wiped his perspiring face with his hands and pulled up the damp
 36997	collar which he had arranged so well at home to seem like a manâs.
 36998	
 36999	He felt that he no longer looked presentable, and feared that if he were
 37000	now to approach the gentlemen-in-waiting in that plight he would not be
 37001	admitted to the Emperor. But it was impossible to smarten oneself up
 37002	or move to another place, because of the crowd. One of the generals who
 37003	drove past was an acquaintance of the RostÃ³vsâ, and PÃ©tya thought of
 37004	asking his help, but came to the conclusion that that would not be a
 37005	manly thing to do. When the carriages had all passed in, the crowd,
 37006	carrying PÃ©tya with it, streamed forward into the KrÃ©mlin Square which
 37007	was already full of people. There were people not only in the square,
 37008	but everywhereâon the slopes and on the roofs. As soon as PÃ©tya found
 37009	himself in the square he clearly heard the sound of bells and the joyous
 37010	voices of the crowd that filled the whole KrÃ©mlin.
 37011	
 37012	For a while the crowd was less dense, but suddenly all heads were bared,
 37013	and everyone rushed forward in one direction. PÃ©tya was being pressed so
 37014	that he could scarcely breathe, and everybody shouted, âHurrah! hurrah!
 37015	hurrah!â PÃ©tya stood on tiptoe and pushed and pinched, but could see
 37016	nothing except the people about him.
 37017	
 37018	All the faces bore the same expression of excitement and enthusiasm. A
 37019	tradesmanâs wife standing beside PÃ©tya sobbed, and the tears ran down
 37020	her cheeks.
 37021	
 37022	âFather! Angel! Dear one!â she kept repeating, wiping away her tears
 37023	with her fingers.
 37024	
 37025	âHurrah!â was heard on all sides.
 37026	
 37027	For a moment the crowd stood still, but then it made another rush
 37028	forward.
 37029	
 37030	Quite beside himself, PÃ©tya, clinching his teeth and rolling his eyes
 37031	ferociously, pushed forward, elbowing his way and shouting âhurrah!â as
 37032	if he were prepared that instant to kill himself and everyone else, but
 37033	on both sides of him other people with similarly ferocious faces pushed
 37034	forward and everybody shouted âhurrah!â
 37035	
 37036	âSo this is what the Emperor is!â thought PÃ©tya. âNo, I canât petition
 37037	him myselfâthat would be too bold.â But in spite of this he continued
 37038	to struggle desperately forward, and from between the backs of those
 37039	in front he caught glimpses of an open space with a strip of red cloth
 37040	spread out on it; but just then the crowd swayed backâthe police
 37041	in front were pushing back those who had pressed too close to the
 37042	procession: the Emperor was passing from the palace to the Cathedral of
 37043	the Assumptionâand PÃ©tya unexpectedly received such a blow on his side
 37044	and ribs and was squeezed so hard that suddenly everything grew dim
 37045	before his eyes and he lost consciousness. When he came to himself, a
 37046	man of clerical appearance with a tuft of gray hair at the back of
 37047	his head and wearing a shabby blue cassockâprobably a church clerk and
 37048	chanterâwas holding him under the arm with one hand while warding off
 37049	the pressure of the crowd with the other.
 37050	
 37051	âYouâve crushed the young gentleman!â said the clerk. âWhat are you up
 37052	to? Gently!... Theyâve crushed him, crushed him!â
 37053	
 37054	The Emperor entered the Cathedral of the Assumption. The crowd spread
 37055	out again more evenly, and the clerk led PÃ©tyaâpale and breathlessâto
 37056	the Tsar-cannon. Several people were sorry for PÃ©tya, and suddenly a
 37057	crowd turned toward him and pressed round him. Those who stood nearest
 37058	him attended to him, unbuttoned his coat, seated him on the raised
 37059	platform of the cannon, and reproached those others (whoever they might
 37060	be) who had crushed him.
 37061	
 37062	âOne might easily get killed that way! What do they mean by it? Killing
 37063	people! Poor dear, heâs as white as a sheet!ââvarious voices were heard
 37064	saying.
 37065	
 37066	PÃ©tya soon came to himself, the color returned to his face, the pain had
 37067	passed, and at the cost of that temporary unpleasantness he had obtained
 37068	a place by the cannon from where he hoped to see the Emperor who
 37069	would be returning that way. PÃ©tya no longer thought of presenting his
 37070	petition. If he could only see the Emperor he would be happy!
 37071	
 37072	While the service was proceeding in the Cathedral of the Assumptionâit
 37073	was a combined service of prayer on the occasion of the Emperorâs
 37074	arrival and of thanksgiving for the conclusion of peace with the
 37075	Turksâthe crowd outside spread out and hawkers appeared, selling kvas,
 37076	gingerbread, and poppyseed sweets (of which PÃ©tya was particularly
 37077	fond), and ordinary conversation could again be heard. A tradesmanâs
 37078	wife was showing a rent in her shawl and telling how much the shawl had
 37079	cost; another was saying that all silk goods had now got dear. The clerk
 37080	who had rescued PÃ©tya was talking to a functionary about the priests who
 37081	were officiating that day with the bishop. The clerk several times used
 37082	the word âplenaryâ (of the service), a word PÃ©tya did not understand.
 37083	Two young citizens were joking with some serf girls who were cracking
 37084	nuts. All these conversations, especially the joking with the girls,
 37085	were such as might have had a particular charm for PÃ©tya at his age, but
 37086	they did not interest him now. He sat on his elevationâthe pedestal of
 37087	the cannonâstill agitated as before by the thought of the Emperor and by
 37088	his love for him. The feeling of pain and fear he had experienced when
 37089	he was being crushed, together with that of rapture, still further
 37090	intensified his sense of the importance of the occasion.
 37091	
 37092	Suddenly the sound of a firing of cannon was heard from the embankment,
 37093	to celebrate the signing of peace with the Turks, and the crowd rushed
 37094	impetuously toward the embankment to watch the firing. PÃ©tya too would
 37095	have run there, but the clerk who had taken the young gentleman under
 37096	his protection stopped him. The firing was still proceeding when
 37097	officers, generals, and gentlemen-in-waiting came running out of the
 37098	cathedral, and after them others in a more leisurely manner: caps were
 37099	again raised, and those who had run to look at the cannon ran back
 37100	again. At last four men in uniforms and sashes emerged from the
 37101	cathedral doors. âHurrah! hurrah!â shouted the crowd again.
 37102	
 37103	âWhich is he? Which?â asked PÃ©tya in a tearful voice, of those around
 37104	him, but no one answered him, everybody was too excited; and PÃ©tya,
 37105	fixing on one of those four men, whom he could not clearly see for the
 37106	tears of joy that filled his eyes, concentrated all his enthusiasm
 37107	on himâthough it happened not to be the Emperorâfrantically shouted
 37108	âHurrah!â and resolved that tomorrow, come what might, he would join the
 37109	army.
 37110	
 37111	The crowd ran after the Emperor, followed him to the palace, and began
 37112	to disperse. It was already late, and PÃ©tya had not eaten anything and
 37113	was drenched with perspiration, yet he did not go home but stood with
 37114	that diminishing, but still considerable, crowd before the palace while
 37115	the Emperor dinedâlooking in at the palace windows, expecting he knew
 37116	not what, and envying alike the notables he saw arriving at the entrance
 37117	to dine with the Emperor and the court footmen who served at table,
 37118	glimpses of whom could be seen through the windows.
 37119	
 37120	While the Emperor was dining, ValÃºev, looking out of the window, said:
 37121	
 37122	âThe people are still hoping to see Your Majesty again.â
 37123	
 37124	The dinner was nearly over, and the Emperor, munching a biscuit, rose
 37125	and went out onto the balcony. The people, with PÃ©tya among them, rushed
 37126	toward the balcony.
 37127	
 37128	âAngel! Dear one! Hurrah! Father!...â cried the crowd, and PÃ©tya with
 37129	it, and again the women and men of weaker mold, PÃ©tya among them, wept
 37130	with joy.
 37131	
 37132	A largish piece of the biscuit the Emperor was holding in his hand broke
 37133	off, fell on the balcony parapet, and then to the ground. A coachman in
 37134	a jerkin, who stood nearest, sprang forward and snatched it up. Several
 37135	people in the crowd rushed at the coachman. Seeing this the Emperor had
 37136	a plateful of biscuits brought him and began throwing them down from
 37137	the balcony. PÃ©tyaâs eyes grew bloodshot, and still more excited by the
 37138	danger of being crushed, he rushed at the biscuits. He did not know why,
 37139	but he had to have a biscuit from the Tsarâs hand and he felt that he
 37140	must not give way. He sprang forward and upset an old woman who was
 37141	catching at a biscuit; the old woman did not consider herself defeated
 37142	though she was lying on the groundâshe grabbed at some biscuits but
 37143	her hand did not reach them. PÃ©tya pushed her hand away with his knee,
 37144	seized a biscuit, and as if fearing to be too late, again shouted
 37145	âHurrah!â with a voice already hoarse.
 37146	
 37147	The Emperor went in, and after that the greater part of the crowd began
 37148	to disperse.
 37149	
 37150	âThere! I said if only we waitedâand so it was!â was being joyfully said
 37151	by various people.
 37152	
 37153	Happy as PÃ©tya was, he felt sad at having to go home knowing that all
 37154	the enjoyment of that day was over. He did not go straight home from
 37155	the KrÃ©mlin, but called on his friend ObolÃ©nski, who was fifteen and was
 37156	also entering the regiment. On returning home PÃ©tya announced resolutely
 37157	and firmly that if he was not allowed to enter the service he would
 37158	run away. And next day, Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³vâthough he had not yet quite
 37159	yieldedâwent to inquire how he could arrange for PÃ©tya to serve where
 37160	there would be least danger.
 37161	
 37162	
 37163	
 37164	
 37165	
 37166	CHAPTER XXII
 37167	
 37168	Two days later, on the fifteenth of July, an immense number of carriages
 37169	were standing outside the SlobÃ³da Palace.
 37170	
 37171	The great halls were full. In the first were the nobility and gentry in
 37172	their uniforms, in the second bearded merchants in full-skirted coats
 37173	of blue cloth and wearing medals. In the noblemenâs hall there was
 37174	an incessant movement and buzz of voices. The chief magnates sat on
 37175	high-backed chairs at a large table under the portrait of the Emperor,
 37176	but most of the gentry were strolling about the room.
 37177	
 37178	All these nobles, whom Pierre met every day at the Club or in their own
 37179	houses, were in uniformâsome in that of Catherineâs day, others in that
 37180	of Emperor Paul, others again in the new uniforms of Alexanderâs time or
 37181	the ordinary uniform of the nobility, and the general characteristic
 37182	of being in uniform imparted something strange and fantastic to these
 37183	diverse and familiar personalities, both old and young. The old men,
 37184	dim-eyed, toothless, bald, sallow, and bloated, or gaunt and wrinkled,
 37185	were especially striking. For the most part they sat quietly in their
 37186	places and were silent, or, if they walked about and talked, attached
 37187	themselves to someone younger. On all these faces, as on the faces
 37188	of the crowd PÃ©tya had seen in the Square, there was a striking
 37189	contradiction: the general expectation of a solemn event, and at the
 37190	same time the everyday interests in a boston card party, Peter the cook,
 37191	ZinaÃ­da DmÃ­trievnaâs health, and so on.
 37192	
 37193	Pierre was there too, buttoned up since early morning in a noblemanâs
 37194	uniform that had become too tight for him. He was agitated;
 37195	this extraordinary gathering not only of nobles but also of the
 37196	merchant-classâles Ã©tats gÃ©nÃ©raux (States-General)âevoked in him a whole
 37197	series of ideas he had long laid aside but which were deeply graven in
 37198	his soul: thoughts of the Contrat Social and the French Revolution. The
 37199	words that had struck him in the Emperorâs appealâthat the sovereign was
 37200	coming to the capital for consultation with his peopleâstrengthened this
 37201	idea. And imagining that in this direction something important which
 37202	he had long awaited was drawing near, he strolled about watching and
 37203	listening to conversations, but nowhere finding any confirmation of the
 37204	ideas that occupied him.
 37205	
 37206	The Emperorâs manifesto was read, evoking enthusiasm, and then all moved
 37207	about discussing it. Besides the ordinary topics of conversation, Pierre
 37208	heard questions of where the marshals of the nobility were to stand when
 37209	the Emperor entered, when a ball should be given in the Emperorâs
 37210	honor, whether they should group themselves by districts or by whole
 37211	provinces... and so on; but as soon as the war was touched on, or
 37212	what the nobility had been convened for, the talk became undecided and
 37213	indefinite. Then all preferred listening to speaking.
 37214	
 37215	A middle-aged man, handsome and virile, in the uniform of a retired
 37216	naval officer, was speaking in one of the rooms, and a small crowd was
 37217	pressing round him. Pierre went up to the circle that had formed round
 37218	the speaker and listened. Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v, in a military uniform of
 37219	Catherineâs time, was sauntering with a pleasant smile among the crowd,
 37220	with all of whom he was acquainted. He too approached that group and
 37221	listened with a kindly smile and nods of approval, as he always did,
 37222	to what the speaker was saying. The retired naval man was speaking very
 37223	boldly, as was evident from the expression on the faces of the listeners
 37224	and from the fact that some people Pierre knew as the meekest and
 37225	quietest of men walked away disapprovingly or expressed disagreement
 37226	with him. Pierre pushed his way into the middle of the group, listened,
 37227	and convinced himself that the man was indeed a liberal, but of views
 37228	quite different from his own. The naval officer spoke in a particularly
 37229	sonorous, musical, and aristocratic baritone voice, pleasantly
 37230	swallowing his râs and generally slurring his consonants: the voice of
 37231	a man calling out to his servant, âHeah! Bwing me my pipe!â It was
 37232	indicative of dissipation and the exercise of authority.
 37233	
 37234	âWhat if the SmolÃ©nsk people have offahd to waise militia for the
 37235	Empewah? Ah we to take SmolÃ©nsk as our patteân? If the noble awistocwacy
 37236	of the pwovince of Moscow thinks fit, it can show its loyalty to our
 37237	sovâweign the Empewah in other ways. Have we foâgotten the waising of
 37238	the militia in the yeah âseven? All that did was to enwich the pwiestsâ
 37239	sons and thieves and wobbahs....â
 37240	
 37241	Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v smiled blandly and nodded approval.
 37242	
 37243	âAnd was our militia of any use to the Empia? Not at all! It only wuined
 37244	our farming! Bettah have another conscwiption... oâ ouâ men will wetuân
 37245	neithah soldiers noâ peasants, and weâll get only depwavity fwom them.
 37246	The nobility donât gwudge theah livesâevewy one of us will go and bwing
 37247	in more wecwuits, and the sovâweignâ (that was the way he referred to
 37248	the Emperor) âneed only say the word and weâll all die foâ him!â added
 37249	the orator with animation.
 37250	
 37251	Count RostÃ³vâs mouth watered with pleasure and he nudged Pierre, but
 37252	Pierre wanted to speak himself. He pushed forward, feeling stirred,
 37253	but not yet sure what stirred him or what he would say. Scarcely had he
 37254	opened his mouth when one of the senators, a man without a tooth in his
 37255	head, with a shrewd though angry expression, standing near the first
 37256	speaker, interrupted him. Evidently accustomed to managing debates and
 37257	to maintaining an argument, he began in low but distinct tones:
 37258	
 37259	âI imagine, sir,â said he, mumbling with his toothless mouth, âthat we
 37260	have been summoned here not to discuss whether itâs best for the empire
 37261	at the present moment to adopt conscription or to call out the militia.
 37262	We have been summoned to reply to the appeal with which our sovereign
 37263	the Emperor has honored us. But to judge what is bestâconscription or
 37264	the militiaâwe can leave to the supreme authority....â
 37265	
 37266	Pierre suddenly saw an outlet for his excitement. He hardened his heart
 37267	against the senator who was introducing this set and narrow attitude
 37268	into the deliberations of the nobility. Pierre stepped forward and
 37269	interrupted him. He himself did not yet know what he would say, but he
 37270	began to speak eagerly, occasionally lapsing into French or expressing
 37271	himself in bookish Russian.
 37272	
 37273	âExcuse me, your excellency,â he began. (He was well acquainted with
 37274	the senator, but thought it necessary on this occasion to address him
 37275	formally.) âThough I donât agree with the gentleman...â (he hesitated:
 37276	he wished to say, âMon trÃ¨s honorable prÃ©opinantâââMy very honorable
 37277	opponentâ) âwith the gentleman... whom I have not the honor of knowing,
 37278	I suppose that the nobility have been summoned not merely to express
 37279	their sympathy and enthusiasm but also to consider the means by which
 37280	we can assist our Fatherland! I imagine,â he went on, warming to his
 37281	subject, âthat the Emperor himself would not be satisfied to find in us
 37282	merely owners of serfs whom we are willing to devote to his service, and
 37283	chair Ã  canon * we are ready to make of ourselvesâand not to obtain from
 37284	us any co-co-counsel.â
 37285	
 37286	    * âFood for cannon.â
 37287	
 37288	
 37289	Many persons withdrew from the circle, noticing the senatorâs sarcastic
 37290	smile and the freedom of Pierreâs remarks. Only Count RostÃ³v was pleased
 37291	with them as he had been pleased with those of the naval officer, the
 37292	senator, and in general with whatever speech he had last heard.
 37293	
 37294	âI think that before discussing these questions,â Pierre continued, âwe
 37295	should ask the Emperorâmost respectfully ask His Majestyâto let us know
 37296	the number of our troops and the position in which our army and our
 37297	forces now are, and then...â
 37298	
 37299	But scarcely had Pierre uttered these words before he was attacked from
 37300	three sides. The most vigorous attack came from an old acquaintance,
 37301	a boston player who had always been well disposed toward him, StepÃ¡n
 37302	StepÃ¡novich AdrÃ¡ksin. AdrÃ¡ksin was in uniform, and whether as a result
 37303	of the uniform or from some other cause Pierre saw before him quite a
 37304	different man. With a sudden expression of malevolence on his aged face,
 37305	AdrÃ¡ksin shouted at Pierre:
 37306	
 37307	âIn the first place, I tell you we have no right to question the Emperor
 37308	about that, and secondly, if the Russian nobility had that right, the
 37309	Emperor could not answer such a question. The troops are moved
 37310	according to the enemyâs movements and the number of men increases and
 37311	decreases....â
 37312	
 37313	Another voice, that of a nobleman of medium height and about forty years
 37314	of age, whom Pierre had formerly met at the gypsiesâ and knew as a bad
 37315	cardplayer, and who, also transformed by his uniform, came up to Pierre,
 37316	interrupted AdrÃ¡ksin.
 37317	
 37318	âYes, and this is not a time for discussing,â he continued, âbut for
 37319	acting: there is war in Russia! The enemy is advancing to destroy
 37320	Russia, to desecrate the tombs of our fathers, to carry off our wives
 37321	and children.â The nobleman smote his breast. âWe will all arise,
 37322	everyone of us will go, for our father the Tsar!â he shouted, rolling
 37323	his bloodshot eyes. Several approving voices were heard in the crowd.
 37324	âWe are Russians and will not grudge our blood in defense of our faith,
 37325	the throne, and the Fatherland! We must cease raving if we are sons of
 37326	our Fatherland! We will show Europe how Russia rises to the defense of
 37327	Russia!â
 37328	
 37329	Pierre wished to reply, but could not get in a word. He felt that his
 37330	words, apart from what meaning they conveyed, were less audible than the
 37331	sound of his opponentâs voice.
 37332	
 37333	Count RostÃ³v at the back of the crowd was expressing approval; several
 37334	persons, briskly turning a shoulder to the orator at the end of a
 37335	phrase, said:
 37336	
 37337	âThatâs right, quite right! Just so!â
 37338	
 37339	Pierre wished to say that he was ready to sacrifice his money, his
 37340	serfs, or himself, only one ought to know the state of affairs in
 37341	order to be able to improve it, but he was unable to speak. Many voices
 37342	shouted and talked at the same time, so that Count RostÃ³v had not time
 37343	to signify his approval of them all, and the group increased, dispersed,
 37344	re-formed, and then moved with a hum of talk into the largest hall and
 37345	to the big table. Not only was Pierreâs attempt to speak unsuccessful,
 37346	but he was rudely interrupted, pushed aside, and people turned away
 37347	from him as from a common enemy. This happened not because they were
 37348	displeased by the substance of his speech, which had even been forgotten
 37349	after the many subsequent speeches, but to animate it the crowd needed a
 37350	tangible object to love and a tangible object to hate. Pierre became the
 37351	latter. Many other orators spoke after the excited nobleman, and all in
 37352	the same tone. Many spoke eloquently and with originality.
 37353	
 37354	GlÃ­nka, the editor of the Russian Messenger, who was recognized (cries
 37355	of âauthor! author!â were heard in the crowd), said that âhell must be
 37356	repulsed by hell,â and that he had seen a child smiling at lightning
 37357	flashes and thunderclaps, but âwe will not be that child.â
 37358	
 37359	âYes, yes, at thunderclaps!â was repeated approvingly in the back rows
 37360	of the crowd.
 37361	
 37362	The crowd drew up to the large table, at which sat gray-haired or bald
 37363	seventy-year-old magnates, uniformed and besashed almost all of whom
 37364	Pierre had seen in their own homes with their buffoons, or playing
 37365	boston at the clubs. With an incessant hum of voices the crowd advanced
 37366	to the table. Pressed by the throng against the high backs of the
 37367	chairs, the orators spoke one after another and sometimes two together.
 37368	Those standing behind noticed what a speaker omitted to say and hastened
 37369	to supply it. Others in that heat and crush racked their brains to find
 37370	some thought and hastened to utter it. The old magnates, whom Pierre
 37371	knew, sat and turned to look first at one and then at another, and their
 37372	faces for the most part only expressed the fact that they found it very
 37373	hot. Pierre, however, felt excited, and the general desire to show that
 37374	they were ready to go to all lengthsâwhich found expression in the tones
 37375	and looks more than in the substance of the speechesâinfected him too.
 37376	He did not renounce his opinions, but felt himself in some way to blame
 37377	and wished to justify himself.
 37378	
 37379	âI only said that it would be more to the purpose to make sacrifices
 37380	when we know what is needed!â said he, trying to be heard above the
 37381	other voices.
 37382	
 37383	One of the old men nearest to him looked round, but his attention was
 37384	immediately diverted by an exclamation at the other side of the table.
 37385	
 37386	âYes, Moscow will be surrendered! She will be our expiation!â shouted
 37387	one man.
 37388	
 37389	âHe is the enemy of mankind!â cried another. âAllow me to speak....â
 37390	âGentlemen, you are crushing me!...â
 37391	
 37392	
 37393	
 37394

 37396	CHAPTER XXIII
 37397	
 37398	At that moment Count RostopchÃ­n with his protruding chin and alert eyes,
 37399	wearing the uniform of a general with sash over his shoulder, entered
 37400	the room, stepping briskly to the front of the crowd of gentry.
 37401	
 37402	âOur sovereign the Emperor will be here in a moment,â said RostopchÃ­n.
 37403	âI am straight from the palace. Seeing the position we are in, I think
 37404	there is little need for discussion. The Emperor has deigned to summon
 37405	us and the merchants. Millions will pour forth from thereââhe pointed
 37406	to the merchantsâ hallââbut our business is to supply men and not spare
 37407	ourselves.... That is the least we can do!â
 37408	
 37409	A conference took place confined to the magnates sitting at the table.
 37410	The whole consultation passed more than quietly. After all the preceding
 37411	noise the sound of their old voices saying one after another, âI
 37412	agree,â or for variety, âI too am of that opinion,â and so on had even a
 37413	mournful effect.
 37414	
 37415	The secretary was told to write down the resolution of the Moscow
 37416	nobility and gentry, that they would furnish ten men, fully equipped,
 37417	out of every thousand serfs, as the SmolÃ©nsk gentry had done. Their
 37418	chairs made a scraping noise as the gentlemen who had conferred rose
 37419	with apparent relief, and began walking up and down, arm in arm, to
 37420	stretch their legs and converse in couples.
 37421	
 37422	âThe Emperor! The Emperor!â a sudden cry resounded through the halls and
 37423	the whole throng hurried to the entrance.
 37424	
 37425	The Emperor entered the hall through a broad path between two lines of
 37426	nobles. Every face expressed respectful, awe-struck curiosity. Pierre
 37427	stood rather far off and could not hear all that the Emperor said. From
 37428	what he did hear he understood that the Emperor spoke of the danger
 37429	threatening the empire and of the hopes he placed on the Moscow
 37430	nobility. He was answered by a voice which informed him of the
 37431	resolution just arrived at.
 37432	
 37433	âGentlemen!â said the Emperor with a quivering voice.
 37434	
 37435	There was a rustling among the crowd and it again subsided, so that
 37436	Pierre distinctly heard the pleasantly human voice of the Emperor saying
 37437	with emotion:
 37438	
 37439	âI never doubted the devotion of the Russian nobles, but today it has
 37440	surpassed my expectations. I thank you in the name of the Fatherland!
 37441	Gentlemen, let us act! Time is most precious....â
 37442	
 37443	The Emperor ceased speaking, the crowd began pressing round him, and
 37444	rapturous exclamations were heard from all sides.
 37445	
 37446	âYes, most precious... a royal word,â said Count RostÃ³v, with a sob. He
 37447	stood at the back, and, though he had heard hardly anything, understood
 37448	everything in his own way.
 37449	
 37450	From the hall of the nobility the Emperor went to that of the merchants.
 37451	There he remained about ten minutes. Pierre was among those who saw him
 37452	come out from the merchantsâ hall with tears of emotion in his eyes.
 37453	As became known later, he had scarcely begun to address the merchants
 37454	before tears gushed from his eyes and he concluded in a trembling
 37455	voice. When Pierre saw the Emperor he was coming out accompanied by two
 37456	merchants, one of whom Pierre knew, a fat otkupshchÃ­k. The other was
 37457	the mayor, a man with a thin sallow face and narrow beard. Both were
 37458	weeping. Tears filled the thin manâs eyes, and the fat otkupshchÃ­k
 37459	sobbed outright like a child and kept repeating:
 37460	
 37461	âOur lives and propertyâtake them, Your Majesty!â
 37462	
 37463	Pierreâs one feeling at the moment was a desire to show that he was
 37464	ready to go all lengths and was prepared to sacrifice everything. He now
 37465	felt ashamed of his speech with its constitutional tendency and sought
 37466	an opportunity of effacing it. Having heard that Count MamÃ³nov was
 37467	furnishing a regiment, BezÃºkhov at once informed RostopchÃ­n that he
 37468	would give a thousand men and their maintenance.
 37469	
 37470	Old RostÃ³v could not tell his wife of what had passed without tears, and
 37471	at once consented to PÃ©tyaâs request and went himself to enter his name.
 37472	
 37473	Next day the Emperor left Moscow. The assembled nobles all took off
 37474	their uniforms and settled down again in their homes and clubs, and not
 37475	without some groans gave orders to their stewards about the enrollment,
 37476	feeling amazed themselves at what they had done.

 37487	
 37488	CHAPTER I
 37489	
 37490	Napoleon began the war with Russia because he could not resist going
 37491	to Dresden, could not help having his head turned by the homage he
 37492	received, could not help donning a Polish uniform and yielding to the
 37493	stimulating influence of a June morning, and could not refrain from
 37494	bursts of anger in the presence of KurÃ¡kin and then of BalashÃ«v.
 37495	
 37496	Alexander refused negotiations because he felt himself to be personally
 37497	insulted. Barclay de Tolly tried to command the army in the best
 37498	way, because he wished to fulfill his duty and earn fame as a great
 37499	commander. RostÃ³v charged the French because he could not restrain
 37500	his wish for a gallop across a level field; and in the same way the
 37501	innumerable people who took part in the war acted in accord with their
 37502	personal characteristics, habits, circumstances, and aims. They were
 37503	moved by fear or vanity, rejoiced or were indignant, reasoned, imagining
 37504	that they knew what they were doing and did it of their own free will,
 37505	but they all were involuntary tools of history, carrying on a work
 37506	concealed from them but comprehensible to us. Such is the inevitable
 37507	fate of men of action, and the higher they stand in the social hierarchy
 37508	the less are they free.
 37509	
 37510	The actors of 1812 have long since left the stage, their personal
 37511	interests have vanished leaving no trace, and nothing remains of that
 37512	time but its historic results.
 37513	
 37514	Providence compelled all these men, striving to attain personal aims, to
 37515	further the accomplishment of a stupendous result no one of them at all
 37516	expectedâneither Napoleon, nor Alexander, nor still less any of those
 37517	who did the actual fighting.
 37518	
 37519	The cause of the destruction of the French army in 1812 is clear to us
 37520	now. No one will deny that that cause was, on the one hand, its advance
 37521	into the heart of Russia late in the season without any preparation for
 37522	a winter campaign and, on the other, the character given to the war
 37523	by the burning of Russian towns and the hatred of the foe this aroused
 37524	among the Russian people. But no one at the time foresaw (what now seems
 37525	so evident) that this was the only way an army of eight hundred thousand
 37526	menâthe best in the world and led by the best generalâcould be destroyed
 37527	in conflict with a raw army of half its numerical strength, and led by
 37528	inexperienced commanders as the Russian army was. Not only did no one
 37529	see this, but on the Russian side every effort was made to hinder the
 37530	only thing that could save Russia, while on the French side, despite
 37531	Napoleonâs experience and so-called military genius, every effort was
 37532	directed to pushing on to Moscow at the end of the summer, that is, to
 37533	doing the very thing that was bound to lead to destruction.
 37534	
 37535	In historical works on the year 1812 French writers are very fond of
 37536	saying that Napoleon felt the danger of extending his line, that he
 37537	sought a battle and that his marshals advised him to stop at SmolÃ©nsk,
 37538	and of making similar statements to show that the danger of the campaign
 37539	was even then understood. Russian authors are still fonder of telling
 37540	us that from the commencement of the campaign a Scythian war plan was
 37541	adopted to lure Napoleon into the depths of Russia, and this plan some
 37542	of them attribute to Pfuel, others to a certain Frenchman, others to
 37543	Toll, and others again to Alexander himselfâpointing to notes, projects,
 37544	and letters which contain hints of such a line of action. But all these
 37545	hints at what happened, both from the French side and the Russian, are
 37546	advanced only because they fit in with the event. Had that event not
 37547	occurred these hints would have been forgotten, as we have forgotten the
 37548	thousands and millions of hints and expectations to the contrary
 37549	which were current then but have now been forgotten because the event
 37550	falsified them. There are always so many conjectures as to the issue of
 37551	any event that however it may end there will always be people to say:
 37552	âI said then that it would be so,â quite forgetting that amid their
 37553	innumerable conjectures many were to quite the contrary effect.
 37554	
 37555	Conjectures as to Napoleonâs awareness of the danger of extending his
 37556	line, and (on the Russian side) as to luring the enemy into the depths
 37557	of Russia, are evidently of that kind, and only by much straining can
 37558	historians attribute such conceptions to Napoleon and his marshals,
 37559	or such plans to the Russian commanders. All the facts are in flat
 37560	contradiction to such conjectures. During the whole period of the war
 37561	not only was there no wish on the Russian side to draw the French
 37562	into the heart of the country, but from their first entry into Russia
 37563	everything was done to stop them. And not only was Napoleon not afraid
 37564	to extend his line, but he welcomed every step forward as a triumph and
 37565	did not seek battle as eagerly as in former campaigns, but very lazily.
 37566	
 37567	At the very beginning of the war our armies were divided, and our sole
 37568	aim was to unite them, though uniting the armies was no advantage if we
 37569	meant to retire and lure the enemy into the depths of the country. Our
 37570	Emperor joined the army to encourage it to defend every inch of Russian
 37571	soil and not to retreat. The enormous Drissa camp was formed on Pfuelâs
 37572	plan, and there was no intention of retiring farther. The Emperor
 37573	reproached the commanders in chief for every step they retired. He could
 37574	not bear the idea of letting the enemy even reach SmolÃ©nsk, still less
 37575	could he contemplate the burning of Moscow, and when our armies did
 37576	unite he was displeased that SmolÃ©nsk was abandoned and burned without a
 37577	general engagement having been fought under its walls.
 37578	
 37579	So thought the Emperor, and the Russian commanders and people were still
 37580	more provoked at the thought that our forces were retreating into the
 37581	depths of the country.
 37582	
 37583	Napoleon having cut our armies apart advanced far into the country and
 37584	missed several chances of forcing an engagement. In August he was at
 37585	SmolÃ©nsk and thought only of how to advance farther, though as we now
 37586	see that advance was evidently ruinous to him.
 37587	
 37588	The facts clearly show that Napoleon did not foresee the danger of the
 37589	advance on Moscow, nor did Alexander and the Russian commanders then
 37590	think of luring Napoleon on, but quite the contrary. The luring of
 37591	Napoleon into the depths of the country was not the result of any plan,
 37592	for no one believed it to be possible; it resulted from a most complex
 37593	interplay of intrigues, aims, and wishes among those who took part in
 37594	the war and had no perception whatever of the inevitable, or of the one
 37595	way of saving Russia. Everything came about fortuitously. The armies
 37596	were divided at the commencement of the campaign. We tried to unite
 37597	them, with the evident intention of giving battle and checking the
 37598	enemyâs advance, and by this effort to unite them while avoiding battle
 37599	with a much stronger enemy, and necessarily withdrawing the armies at
 37600	an acute angleâwe led the French on to SmolÃ©nsk. But we withdrew at an
 37601	acute angle not only because the French advanced between our two armies;
 37602	the angle became still more acute and we withdrew still farther, because
 37603	Barclay de Tolly was an unpopular foreigner disliked by BagratiÃ³n (who
 37604	would come under his command), and BagratiÃ³nâbeing in command of the
 37605	second armyâtried to postpone joining up and coming under Barclayâs
 37606	command as long as he could. BagratiÃ³n was slow in effecting the
 37607	junctionâthough that was the chief aim of all at headquartersâbecause,
 37608	as he alleged, he exposed his army to danger on this march, and it was
 37609	best for him to retire more to the left and more to the south, worrying
 37610	the enemy from flank and rear and securing from the Ukraine recruits for
 37611	his army; and it looks as if he planned this in order not to come under
 37612	the command of the detested foreigner Barclay, whose rank was inferior
 37613	to his own.
 37614	
 37615	The Emperor was with the army to encourage it, but his presence and
 37616	ignorance of what steps to take, and the enormous number of advisers and
 37617	plans, destroyed the first armyâs energy and it retired.
 37618	
 37619	The intention was to make a stand at the Drissa camp, but Paulucci,
 37620	aiming at becoming commander in chief, unexpectedly employed his energy
 37621	to influence Alexander, and Pfuelâs whole plan was abandoned and the
 37622	command entrusted to Barclay. But as Barclay did not inspire confidence
 37623	his power was limited. The armies were divided, there was no unity of
 37624	command, and Barclay was unpopular; but from this confusion, division,
 37625	and the unpopularity of the foreign commander in chief, there resulted
 37626	on the one hand indecision and the avoidance of a battle (which we could
 37627	not have refrained from had the armies been united and had someone else,
 37628	instead of Barclay, been in command) and on the other an ever-increasing
 37629	indignation against the foreigners and an increase in patriotic zeal.
 37630	
 37631	At last the Emperor left the army, and as the most convenient and indeed
 37632	the only pretext for his departure it was decided that it was necessary
 37633	for him to inspire the people in the capitals and arouse the nation in
 37634	general to a patriotic war. And by this visit of the Emperor to Moscow
 37635	the strength of the Russian army was trebled.
 37636	
 37637	He left in order not to obstruct the commander in chiefâs undivided
 37638	control of the army, and hoping that more decisive action would then
 37639	be taken, but the command of the armies became still more confused and
 37640	enfeebled. Bennigsen, the TsarÃ©vich, and a swarm of adjutants general
 37641	remained with the army to keep the commander in chief under observation
 37642	and arouse his energy, and Barclay, feeling less free than ever under
 37643	the observation of all these âeyes of the Emperor,â became still more
 37644	cautious of undertaking any decisive action and avoided giving battle.
 37645	
 37646	Barclay stood for caution. The TsarÃ©vich hinted at treachery and
 37647	demanded a general engagement. LubomÃ­rski, BronnÃ­tski, Wlocki, and the
 37648	others of that group stirred up so much trouble that Barclay, under
 37649	pretext of sending papers to the Emperor, dispatched these Polish
 37650	adjutants general to Petersburg and plunged into an open struggle with
 37651	Bennigsen and the TsarÃ©vich.
 37652	
 37653	At SmolÃ©nsk the armies at last reunited, much as BagratiÃ³n disliked it.
 37654	
 37655	BagratiÃ³n drove up in a carriage to the house occupied by Barclay.
 37656	Barclay donned his sash and came out to meet and report to his senior
 37657	officer BagratiÃ³n.
 37658	
 37659	Despite his seniority in rank BagratiÃ³n, in this contest of magnanimity,
 37660	took his orders from Barclay, but, having submitted, agreed with him
 37661	less than ever. By the Emperorâs orders BagratiÃ³n reported direct to
 37662	him. He wrote to ArakchÃ©ev, the Emperorâs confidant: âIt must be as
 37663	my sovereign pleases, but I cannot work with the Minister (meaning
 37664	Barclay). For Godâs sake send me somewhere else if only in command of
 37665	a regiment. I cannot stand it here. Headquarters are so full of Germans
 37666	that a Russian cannot exist and there is no sense in anything. I thought
 37667	I was really serving my sovereign and the Fatherland, but it turns out
 37668	that I am serving Barclay. I confess I do not want to.â
 37669	
 37670	The swarm of BronnÃ­tskis and Wintzingerodes and their like still further
 37671	embittered the relations between the commanders in chief, and even
 37672	less unity resulted. Preparations were made to fight the French before
 37673	SmolÃ©nsk. A general was sent to survey the position. This general,
 37674	hating Barclay, rode to visit a friend of his own, a corps commander,
 37675	and, having spent the day with him, returned to Barclay and condemned,
 37676	as unsuitable from every point of view, the battleground he had not
 37677	seen.
 37678	
 37679	While disputes and intrigues were going on about the future field of
 37680	battle, and while we were looking for the Frenchâhaving lost touch with
 37681	themâthe French stumbled upon NevÃ©rovskiâs division and reached the
 37682	walls of SmolÃ©nsk.
 37683	
 37684	It was necessary to fight an unexpected battle at SmolÃ©nsk to save our
 37685	lines of communication. The battle was fought and thousands were killed
 37686	on both sides.
 37687	
 37688	SmolÃ©nsk was abandoned contrary to the wishes of the Emperor and of the
 37689	whole people. But SmolÃ©nsk was burned by its own inhabitants who had
 37690	been misled by their governor. And these ruined inhabitants, setting
 37691	an example to other Russians, went to Moscow thinking only of their own
 37692	losses but kindling hatred of the foe. Napoleon advanced farther and we
 37693	retired, thus arriving at the very result which caused his destruction.

 37699	CHAPTER II
 37700	
 37701	The day after his son had left, Prince Nicholas sent for Princess Mary
 37702	to come to his study.
 37703	
 37704	âWell? Are you satisfied now?â said he. âYouâve made me quarrel with my
 37705	son! Satisfied, are you? Thatâs all you wanted! Satisfied?... It hurts
 37706	me, it hurts. Iâm old and weak and this is what you wanted. Well then,
 37707	gloat over it! Gloat over it!â
 37708	
 37709	After that Princess Mary did not see her father for a whole week. He was
 37710	ill and did not leave his study.
 37711	
 37712	Princess Mary noticed to her surprise that during this illness the
 37713	old prince not only excluded her from his room, but did not admit
 37714	Mademoiselle Bourienne either. TÃ­khon alone attended him.
 37715	
 37716	At the end of the week the prince reappeared and resumed his former way
 37717	of life, devoting himself with special activity to building operations
 37718	and the arrangement of the gardens and completely breaking off his
 37719	relations with Mademoiselle Bourienne. His looks and cold tone to his
 37720	daughter seemed to say: âThere, you see? You plotted against me, you
 37721	lied to Prince Andrew about my relations with that Frenchwoman and made
 37722	me quarrel with him, but you see I need neither her nor you!â
 37723	
 37724	Princess Mary spent half of every day with little Nicholas, watching
 37725	his lessons, teaching him Russian and music herself, and talking to
 37726	Dessalles; the rest of the day she spent over her books, with her old
 37727	nurse, or with âGodâs folkâ who sometimes came by the back door to see
 37728	her.
 37729	
 37730	Of the war Princess Mary thought as women do think about wars. She
 37731	feared for her brother who was in it, was horrified by and amazed at
 37732	the strange cruelty that impels men to kill one another, but she did not
 37733	understand the significance of this war, which seemed to her like all
 37734	previous wars. She did not realize the significance of this war, though
 37735	Dessalles with whom she constantly conversed was passionately interested
 37736	in its progress and tried to explain his own conception of it to her,
 37737	and though the âGodâs folkâ who came to see her reported, in their own
 37738	way, the rumors current among the people of an invasion by Antichrist,
 37739	and though Julie (now Princess DrubetskÃ¡ya), who had resumed
 37740	correspondence with her, wrote patriotic letters from Moscow.
 37741	
 37742	âI write you in Russian, my good friend,â wrote Julie in her Frenchified
 37743	Russian, âbecause I have a detestation for all the French, and the
 37744	same for their language which I cannot support to hear spoken.... We in
 37745	Moscow are elated by enthusiasm for our adored Emperor.
 37746	
 37747	âMy poor husband is enduring pains and hunger in Jewish taverns, but the
 37748	news which I have inspires me yet more.
 37749	
 37750	âYou heard probably of the heroic exploit of RaÃ©vski, embracing his two
 37751	sons and saying: âI will perish with them but we will not be shaken!â
 37752	And truly though the enemy was twice stronger than we, we were
 37753	unshakable. We pass the time as we can, but in war as in war! The
 37754	princesses Aline and Sophie sit whole days with me, and we, unhappy
 37755	widows of live men, make beautiful conversations over our charpie, only
 37756	you, my friend, are missing...â and so on.
 37757	
 37758	The chief reason Princess Mary did not realize the full significance of
 37759	this war was that the old prince never spoke of it, did not recognize
 37760	it, and laughed at Dessalles when he mentioned it at dinner.
 37761	The princeâs tone was so calm and confident that Princess Mary
 37762	unhesitatingly believed him.
 37763	
 37764	All that July the old prince was exceedingly active and even animated.
 37765	He planned another garden and began a new building for the domestic
 37766	serfs. The only thing that made Princess Mary anxious about him was that
 37767	he slept very little and, instead of sleeping in his study as usual,
 37768	changed his sleeping place every day. One day he would order his camp
 37769	bed to be set up in the glass gallery, another day he remained on the
 37770	couch or on the lounge chair in the drawing room and dozed there without
 37771	undressing, whileâinstead of Mademoiselle Bourienneâa serf boy read to
 37772	him. Then again he would spend a night in the dining room.
 37773	
 37774	On August 1, a second letter was received from Prince Andrew. In his
 37775	first letter which came soon after he had left home, Prince Andrew had
 37776	dutifully asked his fatherâs forgiveness for what he had allowed himself
 37777	to say and begged to be restored to his favor. To this letter the old
 37778	prince had replied affectionately, and from that time had kept the
 37779	Frenchwoman at a distance. Prince Andrewâs second letter, written near
 37780	VÃ­tebsk after the French had occupied that town, gave a brief account of
 37781	the whole campaign, enclosed for them a plan he had drawn and forecasts
 37782	as to the further progress of the war. In this letter Prince Andrew
 37783	pointed out to his father the danger of staying at Bald Hills, so near
 37784	the theater of war and on the armyâs direct line of march, and advised
 37785	him to move to Moscow.
 37786	
 37787	At dinner that day, on Dessallesâ mentioning that the French were said
 37788	to have already entered VÃ­tebsk, the old prince remembered his sonâs
 37789	letter.
 37790	
 37791	âThere was a letter from Prince Andrew today,â he said to Princess
 37792	MaryââHavenât you read it?â
 37793	
 37794	âNo, Father,â she replied in a frightened voice.
 37795	
 37796	She could not have read the letter as she did not even know it had
 37797	arrived.
 37798	
 37799	âHe writes about this war,â said the prince, with the ironic smile that
 37800	had become habitual to him in speaking of the present war.
 37801	
 37802	âThat must be very interesting,â said Dessalles. âPrince Andrew is in a
 37803	position to know...â
 37804	
 37805	âOh, very interesting!â said Mademoiselle Bourienne.
 37806	
 37807	âGo and get it for me,â said the old prince to Mademoiselle Bourienne.
 37808	âYou knowâunder the paperweight on the little table.â
 37809	
 37810	Mademoiselle Bourienne jumped up eagerly.
 37811	
 37812	âNo, donât!â he exclaimed with a frown. âYou go, Michael IvÃ¡novich.â
 37813	
 37814	Michael IvÃ¡novich rose and went to the study. But as soon as he had left
 37815	the room the old prince, looking uneasily round, threw down his napkin
 37816	and went himself.
 37817	
 37818	âThey canât do anything... always make some muddle,â he muttered.
 37819	
 37820	While he was away Princess Mary, Dessalles, Mademoiselle Bourienne, and
 37821	even little Nicholas exchanged looks in silence. The old prince returned
 37822	with quick steps, accompanied by Michael IvÃ¡novich, bringing the letter
 37823	and a plan. These he put down beside himânot letting anyone read them at
 37824	dinner.
 37825	
 37826	On moving to the drawing room he handed the letter to Princess Mary and,
 37827	spreading out before him the plan of the new building and fixing his
 37828	eyes upon it, told her to read the letter aloud. When she had done so
 37829	Princess Mary looked inquiringly at her father. He was examining the
 37830	plan, evidently engrossed in his own ideas.
 37831	
 37832	âWhat do you think of it, Prince?â Dessalles ventured to ask.
 37833	
 37834	âI? I?...â said the prince as if unpleasantly awakened, and not taking
 37835	his eyes from the plan of the building.
 37836	
 37837	âVery possibly the theater of war will move so near to us that...â
 37838	
 37839	âHa ha ha! The theater of war!â said the prince. âI have said and still
 37840	say that the theater of war is Poland and the enemy will never get
 37841	beyond the Niemen.â
 37842	
 37843	Dessalles looked in amazement at the prince, who was talking of the
 37844	Niemen when the enemy was already at the Dnieper, but Princess Mary,
 37845	forgetting the geographical position of the Niemen, thought that what
 37846	her father was saying was correct.
 37847	
 37848	âWhen the snow melts theyâll sink in the Polish swamps. Only they
 37849	could fail to see it,â the prince continued, evidently thinking of the
 37850	campaign of 1807 which seemed to him so recent. âBennigsen should have
 37851	advanced into Prussia sooner, then things would have taken a different
 37852	turn...â
 37853	
 37854	âBut, Prince,â Dessalles began timidly, âthe letter mentions
 37855	VÃ­tebsk....â
 37856	
 37857	âAh, the letter? Yes...â replied the prince peevishly. âYes... yes...â
 37858	His face suddenly took on a morose expression. He paused. âYes, he
 37859	writes that the French were beaten at... at... what river is it?â
 37860	
 37861	Dessalles dropped his eyes.
 37862	
 37863	âThe prince says nothing about that,â he remarked gently.
 37864	
 37865	âDoesnât he? But I didnât invent it myself.â
 37866	
 37867	No one spoke for a long time.
 37868	
 37869	âYes... yes... Well, Michael IvÃ¡novich,â he suddenly went on, raising
 37870	his head and pointing to the plan of the building, âtell me how you mean
 37871	to alter it....â
 37872	
 37873	Michael IvÃ¡novich went up to the plan, and the prince after speaking to
 37874	him about the building looked angrily at Princess Mary and Dessalles and
 37875	went to his own room.
 37876	
 37877	Princess Mary saw Dessallesâ embarrassed and astonished look fixed on
 37878	her father, noticed his silence, and was struck by the fact that her
 37879	father had forgotten his sonâs letter on the drawing room table; but she
 37880	was not only afraid to speak of it and ask Dessalles the reason of his
 37881	confusion and silence, but was afraid even to think about it.
 37882	
 37883	In the evening Michael IvÃ¡novich, sent by the prince, came to Princess
 37884	Mary for Prince Andrewâs letter which had been forgotten in the drawing
 37885	room. She gave it to him and, unpleasant as it was to her to do so,
 37886	ventured to ask him what her father was doing.
 37887	
 37888	âAlways busy,â replied Michael IvÃ¡novich with a respectfully ironic
 37889	smile which caused Princess Mary to turn pale. âHeâs worrying very much
 37890	about the new building. He has been reading a little, but nowââMichael
 37891	IvÃ¡novich went on, lowering his voiceâânow heâs at his desk, busy with
 37892	his will, I expect.â (One of the princeâs favorite occupations of late
 37893	had been the preparation of some papers he meant to leave at his death
 37894	and which he called his âwill.â)
 37895	
 37896	âAnd AlpÃ¡tych is being sent to SmolÃ©nsk?â asked Princess Mary.
 37897	
 37898	âOh, yes, he has been waiting to start for some time.â
 37899	
 37900	
 37901	
 37902	
 37903	
 37904	CHAPTER III
 37905	
 37906	When Michael IvÃ¡novich returned to the study with the letter, the old
 37907	prince, with spectacles on and a shade over his eyes, was sitting at his
 37908	open bureau with screened candles, holding a paper in his outstretched
 37909	hand, and in a somewhat dramatic attitude was reading his manuscriptâhis
 37910	âRemarksâ as he termed itâwhich was to be transmitted to the Emperor
 37911	after his death.
 37912	
 37913	When Michael IvÃ¡novich went in there were tears in the princeâs eyes
 37914	evoked by the memory of the time when the paper he was now reading had
 37915	been written. He took the letter from Michael IvÃ¡novichâs hand, put it
 37916	in his pocket, folded up his papers, and called in AlpÃ¡tych who had long
 37917	been waiting.
 37918	
 37919	The prince had a list of things to be bought in SmolÃ©nsk and, walking
 37920	up and down the room past AlpÃ¡tych who stood by the door, he gave his
 37921	instructions.
 37922	
 37923	âFirst, notepaperâdo you hear? Eight quires, like this sample,
 37924	gilt-edged... it must be exactly like the sample. Varnish, sealing wax,
 37925	as in Michael IvÃ¡novichâs list.â
 37926	
 37927	He paced up and down for a while and glanced at his notes.
 37928	
 37929	âThen hand to the governor in person a letter about the deed.â
 37930	
 37931	Next, bolts for the doors of the new building were wanted and had to be
 37932	of a special shape the prince had himself designed, and a leather case
 37933	had to be ordered to keep the âwillâ in.
 37934	
 37935	The instructions to AlpÃ¡tych took over two hours and still the prince
 37936	did not let him go. He sat down, sank into thought, closed his eyes, and
 37937	dozed off. AlpÃ¡tych made a slight movement.
 37938	
 37939	âWell, go, go! If anything more is wanted Iâll send after you.â
 37940	
 37941	AlpÃ¡tych went out. The prince again went to his bureau, glanced into it,
 37942	fingered his papers, closed the bureau again, and sat down at the table
 37943	to write to the governor.
 37944	
 37945	It was already late when he rose after sealing the letter. He wished
 37946	to sleep, but he knew he would not be able to and that most depressing
 37947	thoughts came to him in bed. So he called TÃ­khon and went through the
 37948	rooms with him to show him where to set up the bed for that night.
 37949	
 37950	He went about looking at every corner. Every place seemed
 37951	unsatisfactory, but worst of all was his customary couch in the study.
 37952	That couch was dreadful to him, probably because of the oppressive
 37953	thoughts he had had when lying there. It was unsatisfactory everywhere,
 37954	but the corner behind the piano in the sitting room was better than
 37955	other places: he had never slept there yet.
 37956	
 37957	With the help of a footman TÃ­khon brought in the bedstead and began
 37958	putting it up.
 37959	
 37960	âThatâs not right! Thatâs not right!â cried the prince, and himself
 37961	pushed it a few inches from the corner and then closer in again.
 37962	
 37963	âWell, at last Iâve finished, now Iâll rest,â thought the prince, and
 37964	let TÃ­khon undress him.
 37965	
 37966	Frowning with vexation at the effort necessary to divest himself of his
 37967	coat and trousers, the prince undressed, sat down heavily on the
 37968	bed, and appeared to be meditating as he looked contemptuously at his
 37969	withered yellow legs. He was not meditating, but only deferring the
 37970	moment of making the effort to lift those legs up and turn over on the
 37971	bed. âUgh, how hard it is! Oh, that this toil might end and you would
 37972	release me!â thought he. Pressing his lips together he made that effort
 37973	for the twenty-thousandth time and lay down. But hardly had he done so
 37974	before he felt the bed rocking backwards and forwards beneath him as if
 37975	it were breathing heavily and jolting. This happened to him almost every
 37976	night. He opened his eyes as they were closing.
 37977	
 37978	âNo peace, damn them!â he muttered, angry he knew not with whom. âAh
 37979	yes, there was something else important, very important, that I was
 37980	keeping till I should be in bed. The bolts? No, I told him about them.
 37981	No, it was something, something in the drawing room. Princess Mary
 37982	talked some nonsense. Dessalles, that fool, said something. Something in
 37983	my pocketâcanât remember....â
 37984	
 37985	âTÃ­khon, what did we talk about at dinner?â
 37986	
 37987	âAbout Prince Michael...â
 37988	
 37989	âBe quiet, quiet!â The prince slapped his hand on the table. âYes, I
 37990	know, Prince Andrewâs letter! Princess Mary read it. Dessalles said
 37991	something about VÃ­tebsk. Now Iâll read it.â
 37992	
 37993	He had the letter taken from his pocket and the tableâon which stood a
 37994	glass of lemonade and a spiral wax candleâmoved close to the bed, and
 37995	putting on his spectacles he began reading. Only now in the stillness of
 37996	the night, reading it by the faint light under the green shade, did he
 37997	grasp its meaning for a moment.
 37998	
 37999	âThe French at VÃ­tebsk, in four daysâ march they may be at SmolÃ©nsk;
 38000	perhaps are already there! TÃ­khon!â TÃ­khon jumped up. âNo, no, I donât
 38001	want anything!â he shouted.
 38002	
 38003	He put the letter under the candlestick and closed his eyes. And there
 38004	rose before him the Danube at bright noonday: reeds, the Russian
 38005	camp, and himself a young general without a wrinkle on his ruddy face,
 38006	vigorous and alert, entering PotÃ«mkinâs gaily colored tent, and a
 38007	burning sense of jealousy of âthe favoriteâ agitated him now as strongly
 38008	as it had done then. He recalled all the words spoken at that
 38009	first meeting with PotÃ«mkin. And he saw before him a plump, rather
 38010	sallow-faced, short, stout woman, the Empress Mother, with her smile
 38011	and her words at her first gracious reception of him, and then that same
 38012	face on the catafalque, and the encounter he had with ZÃºbov over her
 38013	coffin about his right to kiss her hand.
 38014	
 38015	âOh, quicker, quicker! To get back to that time and have done with all
 38016	the present! Quicker, quickerâand that they should leave me in peace!â
 38017	
 38018	
 38019

 38022	CHAPTER IV
 38023	
 38024	Bald Hills, Prince Nicholas BolkÃ³nskiâs estate, lay forty miles east
 38025	from SmolÃ©nsk and two miles from the main road to Moscow.
 38026	
 38027	The same evening that the prince gave his instructions to AlpÃ¡tych,
 38028	Dessalles, having asked to see Princess Mary, told her that, as the
 38029	prince was not very well and was taking no steps to secure his safety,
 38030	though from Prince Andrewâs letter it was evident that to remain at Bald
 38031	Hills might be dangerous, he respectfully advised her to send a letter
 38032	by AlpÃ¡tych to the Provincial Governor at SmolÃ©nsk, asking him to let
 38033	her know the state of affairs and the extent of the danger to which
 38034	Bald Hills was exposed. Dessalles wrote this letter to the Governor
 38035	for Princess Mary, she signed it, and it was given to AlpÃ¡tych with
 38036	instructions to hand it to the Governor and to come back as quickly as
 38037	possible if there was danger.
 38038	
 38039	Having received all his orders AlpÃ¡tych, wearing a white beaver hatâa
 38040	present from the princeâand carrying a stick as the prince did, went out
 38041	accompanied by his family. Three well-fed roans stood ready harnessed to
 38042	a small conveyance with a leather hood.
 38043	
 38044	The larger bell was muffled and the little bells on the harness stuffed
 38045	with paper. The prince allowed no one at Bald Hills to drive with
 38046	ringing bells; but on a long journey AlpÃ¡tych liked to have them. His
 38047	satellitesâthe senior clerk, a countinghouse clerk, a scullery maid,
 38048	a cook, two old women, a little pageboy, the coachman, and various
 38049	domestic serfsâwere seeing him off.
 38050	
 38051	His daughter placed chintz-covered down cushions for him to sit on and
 38052	behind his back. His old sister-in-law popped in a small bundle, and one
 38053	of the coachmen helped him into the vehicle.
 38054	
 38055	âThere! There! Womenâs fuss! Women, women!â said AlpÃ¡tych, puffing and
 38056	speaking rapidly just as the prince did, and he climbed into the trap.
 38057	
 38058	After giving the clerk orders about the work to be done, AlpÃ¡tych, not
 38059	trying to imitate the prince now, lifted the hat from his bald head and
 38060	crossed himself three times.
 38061	
 38062	âIf there is anything... come back, YÃ¡kov AlpÃ¡tych! For Christâs sake
 38063	think of us!â cried his wife, referring to the rumors of war and the
 38064	enemy.
 38065	
 38066	âWomen, women! Womenâs fuss!â muttered AlpÃ¡tych to himself and started
 38067	on his journey, looking round at the fields of yellow rye and the
 38068	still-green, thickly growing oats, and at other quite black fields just
 38069	being plowed a second time.
 38070	
 38071	As he went along he looked with pleasure at the yearâs splendid crop
 38072	of corn, scrutinized the strips of ryefield which here and there were
 38073	already being reaped, made his calculations as to the sowing and the
 38074	harvest, and asked himself whether he had not forgotten any of the
 38075	princeâs orders.
 38076	
 38077	Having baited the horses twice on the way, he arrived at the town toward
 38078	evening on the fourth of August.
 38079	
 38080	AlpÃ¡tych kept meeting and overtaking baggage trains and troops on the
 38081	road. As he approached SmolÃ©nsk he heard the sounds of distant firing,
 38082	but these did not impress him. What struck him most was the sight of a
 38083	splendid field of oats in which a camp had been pitched and which
 38084	was being mown down by the soldiers, evidently for fodder. This fact
 38085	impressed AlpÃ¡tych, but in thinking about his own business he soon
 38086	forgot it.
 38087	
 38088	All the interests of his life for more than thirty years had been
 38089	bounded by the will of the prince, and he never went beyond that limit.
 38090	Everything not connected with the execution of the princeâs orders did
 38091	not interest and did not even exist for AlpÃ¡tych.
 38092	
 38093	On reaching SmolÃ©nsk on the evening of the fourth of August he put up
 38094	in the GÃ¡china suburb across the Dnieper, at the inn kept by FerapÃ³ntov,
 38095	where he had been in the habit of putting up for the last thirty years.
 38096	Some thirty years ago FerapÃ³ntov, by AlpÃ¡tychâs advice, had bought a
 38097	wood from the prince, had begun to trade, and now had a house, an
 38098	inn, and a corn dealerâs shop in that province. He was a stout, dark,
 38099	red-faced peasant in the forties, with thick lips, a broad knob of a
 38100	nose, similar knobs over his black frowning brows, and a round belly.
 38101	
 38102	Wearing a waistcoat over his cotton shirt, FerapÃ³ntov was standing
 38103	before his shop which opened onto the street. On seeing AlpÃ¡tych he went
 38104	up to him.
 38105	
 38106	âYouâre welcome, YÃ¡kov AlpÃ¡tych. Folks are leaving the town, but you
 38107	have come to it,â said he.
 38108	
 38109	âWhy are they leaving the town?â asked AlpÃ¡tych.
 38110	
 38111	âThatâs what I say. Folks are foolish! Always afraid of the French.â
 38112	
 38113	âWomenâs fuss, womenâs fuss!â said AlpÃ¡tych.
 38114	
 38115	âJust what I think, YÃ¡kov AlpÃ¡tych. What I say is: orders have been
 38116	given not to let them in, so that must be right. And the peasants are
 38117	asking three rubles for cartingâit isnât Christian!â
 38118	
 38119	YÃ¡kov AlpÃ¡tych heard without heeding. He asked for a samovar and for hay
 38120	for his horses, and when he had had his tea he went to bed.
 38121	
 38122	All night long troops were moving past the inn. Next morning AlpÃ¡tych
 38123	donned a jacket he wore only in town and went out on business. It was a
 38124	sunny morning and by eight oâclock it was already hot. âA good day for
 38125	harvesting,â thought AlpÃ¡tych.
 38126	
 38127	From beyond the town firing had been heard since early morning. At eight
 38128	oâclock the booming of cannon was added to the sound of musketry. Many
 38129	people were hurrying through the streets and there were many soldiers,
 38130	but cabs were still driving about, tradesmen stood at their shops, and
 38131	service was being held in the churches as usual. AlpÃ¡tych went to the
 38132	shops, to government offices, to the post office, and to the Governorâs.
 38133	In the offices and shops and at the post office everyone was talking
 38134	about the army and about the enemy who was already attacking the town,
 38135	everybody was asking what should be done, and all were trying to calm
 38136	one another.
 38137	
 38138	In front of the Governorâs house AlpÃ¡tych found a large number of
 38139	people, Cossacks, and a traveling carriage of the Governorâs. At the
 38140	porch he met two of the landed gentry, one of whom he knew. This man, an
 38141	ex-captain of police, was saying angrily:
 38142	
 38143	âItâs no joke, you know! Itâs all very well if youâre single. âOne man
 38144	though undone is but one,â as the proverb says, but with thirteen in
 38145	your family and all the property... Theyâve brought us to utter ruin!
 38146	What sort of governors are they to do that? They ought to be hangedâthe
 38147	brigands!...â
 38148	
 38149	âOh come, thatâs enough!â said the other.
 38150	
 38151	âWhat do I care? Let him hear! Weâre not dogs,â said the ex-captain of
 38152	police, and looking round he noticed AlpÃ¡tych.
 38153	
 38154	âOh, YÃ¡kov AlpÃ¡tych! What have you come for?â
 38155	
 38156	âTo see the Governor by his excellencyâs order,â answered AlpÃ¡tych,
 38157	lifting his head and proudly thrusting his hand into the bosom of his
 38158	coat as he always did when he mentioned the prince.... âHe has ordered
 38159	me to inquire into the position of affairs,â he added.
 38160	
 38161	âYes, go and find out!â shouted the angry gentleman. âTheyâve brought
 38162	things to such a pass that there are no carts or anything!... There it
 38163	is again, do you hear?â said he, pointing in the direction whence came
 38164	the sounds of firing.
 38165	
 38166	âTheyâve brought us all to ruin... the brigands!â he repeated, and
 38167	descended the porch steps.
 38168	
 38169	AlpÃ¡tych swayed his head and went upstairs. In the waiting room were
 38170	tradesmen, women, and officials, looking silently at one another. The
 38171	door of the Governorâs room opened and they all rose and moved forward.
 38172	An official ran out, said some words to a merchant, called a stout
 38173	official with a cross hanging on his neck to follow him, and vanished
 38174	again, evidently wishing to avoid the inquiring looks and questions
 38175	addressed to him. AlpÃ¡tych moved forward and next time the official came
 38176	out addressed him, one hand placed in the breast of his buttoned coat,
 38177	and handed him two letters.
 38178	
 38179	âTo his Honor Baron Asch, from General-in-Chief Prince BolkÃ³nski,â he
 38180	announced with such solemnity and significance that the official turned
 38181	to him and took the letters.
 38182	
 38183	A few minutes later the Governor received AlpÃ¡tych and hurriedly said to
 38184	him:
 38185	
 38186	âInform the prince and princess that I knew nothing: I acted on the
 38187	highest instructionsâhere...â and he handed a paper to AlpÃ¡tych. âStill,
 38188	as the prince is unwell my advice is that they should go to Moscow. I am
 38189	just starting myself. Inform them...â
 38190	
 38191	But the Governor did not finish: a dusty perspiring officer ran into the
 38192	room and began to say something in French. The Governorâs face expressed
 38193	terror.
 38194	
 38195	âGo,â he said, nodding his head to AlpÃ¡tych, and began questioning the
 38196	officer.
 38197	
 38198	Eager, frightened, helpless glances were turned on AlpÃ¡tych when he came
 38199	out of the Governorâs room. Involuntarily listening now to the firing,
 38200	which had drawn nearer and was increasing in strength, AlpÃ¡tych hurried
 38201	to his inn. The paper handed to him by the Governor said this:
 38202	
 38203	âI assure you that the town of SmolÃ©nsk is not in the slightest danger
 38204	as yet and it is unlikely that it will be threatened with any. I from
 38205	the one side and Prince BagratiÃ³n from the other are marching to unite
 38206	our forces before SmolÃ©nsk, which junction will be effected on the
 38207	22nd instant, and both armies with their united forces will defend our
 38208	compatriots of the province entrusted to your care till our efforts
 38209	shall have beaten back the enemies of our Fatherland, or till the last
 38210	warrior in our valiant ranks has perished. From this you will see that
 38211	you have a perfect right to reassure the inhabitants of SmolÃ©nsk, for
 38212	those defended by two such brave armies may feel assured of victory.â
 38213	(Instructions from Barclay de Tolly to Baron Asch, the civil governor of
 38214	SmolÃ©nsk, 1812.)
 38215	
 38216	People were anxiously roaming about the streets.
 38217	
 38218	Carts piled high with household utensils, chairs, and cupboards kept
 38219	emerging from the gates of the yards and moving along the streets.
 38220	Loaded carts stood at the house next to FerapÃ³ntovâs and women were
 38221	wailing and lamenting as they said good-by. A small watchdog ran round
 38222	barking in front of the harnessed horses.
 38223	
 38224	AlpÃ¡tych entered the innyard at a quicker pace than usual and went
 38225	straight to the shed where his horses and trap were. The coachman was
 38226	asleep. He woke him up, told him to harness, and went into the passage.
 38227	From the hostâs room came the sounds of a child crying, the despairing
 38228	sobs of a woman, and the hoarse angry shouting of FerapÃ³ntov. The cook
 38229	began running hither and thither in the passage like a frightened hen,
 38230	just as AlpÃ¡tych entered.
 38231	
 38232	âHeâs done her to death. Killed the mistress!... Beat her... dragged her
 38233	about so!...â
 38234	
 38235	âWhat for?â asked AlpÃ¡tych.
 38236	
 38237	âShe kept begging to go away. Sheâs a woman! âTake me away,â says she,
 38238	âdonât let me perish with my little children! Folks,â she says, âare all
 38239	gone, so why,â she says, âdonât we go?â And he began beating and pulling
 38240	her about so!â
 38241	
 38242	At these words AlpÃ¡tych nodded as if in approval, and not wishing to
 38243	hear more went to the door of the room opposite the innkeeperâs, where
 38244	he had left his purchases.
 38245	
 38246	âYou brute, you murderer!â screamed a thin, pale woman who, with a baby
 38247	in her arms and her kerchief torn from her head, burst through the door
 38248	at that moment and down the steps into the yard.
 38249	
 38250	FerapÃ³ntov came out after her, but on seeing AlpÃ¡tych adjusted his
 38251	waistcoat, smoothed his hair, yawned, and followed AlpÃ¡tych into the
 38252	opposite room.
 38253	
 38254	âGoing already?â said he.
 38255	
 38256	AlpÃ¡tych, without answering or looking at his host, sorted his packages
 38257	and asked how much he owed.
 38258	
 38259	âWeâll reckon up! Well, have you been to the Governorâs?â asked
 38260	FerapÃ³ntov. âWhat has been decided?â
 38261	
 38262	AlpÃ¡tych replied that the Governor had not told him anything definite.
 38263	
 38264	âWith our business, how can we get away?â said FerapÃ³ntov. âWeâd have
 38265	to pay seven rubles a cartload to DorogobÃºzh and I tell them theyâre
 38266	not Christians to ask it! SelivÃ¡nov, now, did a good stroke last
 38267	Thursdayâsold flour to the army at nine rubles a sack. Will you have
 38268	some tea?â he added.
 38269	
 38270	While the horses were being harnessed AlpÃ¡tych and FerapÃ³ntov over their
 38271	tea talked of the price of corn, the crops, and the good weather for
 38272	harvesting.
 38273	
 38274	âWell, it seems to be getting quieter,â remarked FerapÃ³ntov, finishing
 38275	his third cup of tea and getting up. âOurs must have got the best of it.
 38276	The orders were not to let them in. So weâre in force, it seems....
 38277	They say the other day Matthew IvÃ¡nych PlÃ¡tov drove them into the river
 38278	MÃ¡rina and drowned some eighteen thousand in one day.â
 38279	
 38280	AlpÃ¡tych collected his parcels, handed them to the coachman who had come
 38281	in, and settled up with the innkeeper. The noise of wheels, hoofs, and
 38282	bells was heard from the gateway as a little trap passed out.
 38283	
 38284	It was by now late in the afternoon. Half the street was in shadow, the
 38285	other half brightly lit by the sun. AlpÃ¡tych looked out of the window
 38286	and went to the door. Suddenly the strange sound of a far-off whistling
 38287	and thud was heard, followed by a boom of cannon blending into a dull
 38288	roar that set the windows rattling.
 38289	
 38290	He went out into the street: two men were running past toward the
 38291	bridge. From different sides came whistling sounds and the thud of
 38292	cannon balls and bursting shells falling on the town. But these sounds
 38293	were hardly heard in comparison with the noise of the firing outside the
 38294	town and attracted little attention from the inhabitants. The town was
 38295	being bombarded by a hundred and thirty guns which Napoleon had ordered
 38296	up after four oâclock. The people did not at once realize the meaning of
 38297	this bombardment.
 38298	
 38299	At first the noise of the falling bombs and shells only aroused
 38300	curiosity. FerapÃ³ntovâs wife, who till then had not ceased wailing under
 38301	the shed, became quiet and with the baby in her arms went to the gate,
 38302	listening to the sounds and looking in silence at the people.
 38303	
 38304	The cook and a shop assistant came to the gate. With lively curiosity
 38305	everyone tried to get a glimpse of the projectiles as they flew over
 38306	their heads. Several people came round the corner talking eagerly.
 38307	
 38308	âWhat force!â remarked one. âKnocked the roof and ceiling all to
 38309	splinters!â
 38310	
 38311	âRouted up the earth like a pig,â said another.
 38312	
 38313	âThatâs grand, it bucks one up!â laughed the first. âLucky you jumped
 38314	aside, or it would have wiped you out!â
 38315	
 38316	Others joined those men and stopped and told how cannon balls had fallen
 38317	on a house close to them. Meanwhile still more projectiles, now with
 38318	the swift sinister whistle of a cannon ball, now with the agreeable
 38319	intermittent whistle of a shell, flew over peopleâs heads incessantly,
 38320	but not one fell close by, they all flew over. AlpÃ¡tych was getting into
 38321	his trap. The innkeeper stood at the gate.
 38322	
 38323	âWhat are you staring at?â he shouted to the cook, who in her red skirt,
 38324	with sleeves rolled up, swinging her bare elbows, had stepped to the
 38325	corner to listen to what was being said.
 38326	
 38327	âWhat marvels!â she exclaimed, but hearing her masterâs voice she turned
 38328	back, pulling down her tucked-up skirt.
 38329	
 38330	Once more something whistled, but this time quite close, swooping
 38331	downwards like a little bird; a flame flashed in the middle of the
 38332	street, something exploded, and the street was shrouded in smoke.
 38333	
 38334	âScoundrel, what are you doing?â shouted the innkeeper, rushing to the
 38335	cook.
 38336	
 38337	At that moment the pitiful wailing of women was heard from different
 38338	sides, the frightened baby began to cry, and people crowded silently
 38339	with pale faces round the cook. The loudest sound in that crowd was her
 38340	wailing.
 38341	
 38342	âOh-h-h! Dear souls, dear kind souls! Donât let me die! My good
 38343	souls!...â
 38344	
 38345	Five minutes later no one remained in the street. The cook, with her
 38346	thigh broken by a shell splinter, had been carried into the kitchen.
 38347	AlpÃ¡tych, his coachman, FerapÃ³ntovâs wife and children and the house
 38348	porter were all sitting in the cellar, listening. The roar of guns, the
 38349	whistling of projectiles, and the piteous moaning of the cook, which
 38350	rose above the other sounds, did not cease for a moment. The mistress
 38351	rocked and hushed her baby and when anyone came into the cellar asked
 38352	in a pathetic whisper what had become of her husband who had remained
 38353	in the street. A shopman who entered told her that her husband had
 38354	gone with others to the cathedral, whence they were fetching the
 38355	wonder-working icon of SmolÃ©nsk.
 38356	
 38357	Toward dusk the cannonade began to subside. AlpÃ¡tych left the cellar
 38358	and stopped in the doorway. The evening sky that had been so clear was
 38359	clouded with smoke, through which, high up, the sickle of the new moon
 38360	shone strangely. Now that the terrible din of the guns had ceased a hush
 38361	seemed to reign over the town, broken only by the rustle of footsteps,
 38362	the moaning, the distant cries, and the crackle of fires which seemed
 38363	widespread everywhere. The cookâs moans had now subsided. On two sides
 38364	black curling clouds of smoke rose and spread from the fires. Through
 38365	the streets soldiers in various uniforms walked or ran confusedly in
 38366	different directions like ants from a ruined ant-hill. Several of them
 38367	ran into FerapÃ³ntovâs yard before AlpÃ¡tychâs eyes. AlpÃ¡tych went out
 38368	to the gate. A retreating regiment, thronging and hurrying, blocked the
 38369	street.
 38370	
 38371	Noticing him, an officer said: âThe town is being abandoned. Get away,
 38372	get away!â and then, turning to the soldiers, shouted:
 38373	
 38374	âIâll teach you to run into the yards!â
 38375	
 38376	AlpÃ¡tych went back to the house, called the coachman, and told him to
 38377	set off. FerapÃ³ntovâs whole household came out too, following AlpÃ¡tych
 38378	and the coachman. The women, who had been silent till then, suddenly
 38379	began to wail as they looked at the firesâthe smoke and even the flames
 38380	of which could be seen in the failing twilightâand as if in reply the
 38381	same kind of lamentation was heard from other parts of the street.
 38382	Inside the shed AlpÃ¡tych and the coachman arranged the tangled reins and
 38383	traces of their horses with trembling hands.
 38384	
 38385	As AlpÃ¡tych was driving out of the gate he saw some ten soldiers in
 38386	FerapÃ³ntovâs open shop, talking loudly and filling their bags and
 38387	knapsacks with flour and sunflower seeds. Just then FerapÃ³ntov returned
 38388	and entered his shop. On seeing the soldiers he was about to shout at
 38389	them, but suddenly stopped and, clutching at his hair, burst into sobs
 38390	and laughter:
 38391	
 38392	âLoot everything, lads! Donât let those devils get it!â he cried, taking
 38393	some bags of flour himself and throwing them into the street.
 38394	
 38395	Some of the soldiers were frightened and ran away, others went on
 38396	filling their bags. On seeing AlpÃ¡tych, FerapÃ³ntov turned to him:
 38397	
 38398	âRussia is done for!â he cried. âAlpÃ¡tych, Iâll set the place on fire
 38399	myself. Weâre done for!...â and FerapÃ³ntov ran into the yard.
 38400	
 38401	Soldiers were passing in a constant stream along the street blocking
 38402	it completely, so that AlpÃ¡tych could not pass out and had to wait.
 38403	FerapÃ³ntovâs wife and children were also sitting in a cart waiting till
 38404	it was possible to drive out.
 38405	
 38406	Night had come. There were stars in the sky and the new moon shone out
 38407	amid the smoke that screened it. On the sloping descent to the Dnieper
 38408	AlpÃ¡tychâs cart and that of the innkeeperâs wife, which were slowly
 38409	moving amid the rows of soldiers and of other vehicles, had to stop.
 38410	In a side street near the crossroads where the vehicles had stopped, a
 38411	house and some shops were on fire. This fire was already burning itself
 38412	out. The flames now died down and were lost in the black smoke, now
 38413	suddenly flared up again brightly, lighting up with strange distinctness
 38414	the faces of the people crowding at the crossroads. Black figures
 38415	flitted about before the fire, and through the incessant crackling of
 38416	the flames talking and shouting could be heard. Seeing that his trap
 38417	would not be able to move on for some time, AlpÃ¡tych got down and turned
 38418	into the side street to look at the fire. Soldiers were continually
 38419	rushing backwards and forwards near it, and he saw two of them and a
 38420	man in a frieze coat dragging burning beams into another yard across the
 38421	street, while others carried bundles of hay.
 38422	
 38423	AlpÃ¡tych went up to a large crowd standing before a high barn which was
 38424	blazing briskly. The walls were all on fire and the back wall had fallen
 38425	in, the wooden roof was collapsing, and the rafters were alight. The
 38426	crowd was evidently watching for the roof to fall in, and AlpÃ¡tych
 38427	watched for it too.
 38428	
 38429	âAlpÃ¡tych!â a familiar voice suddenly hailed the old man.
 38430	
 38431	âMercy on us! Your excellency!â answered AlpÃ¡tych, immediately
 38432	recognizing the voice of his young prince.
 38433	
 38434	Prince Andrew in his riding cloak, mounted on a black horse, was looking
 38435	at AlpÃ¡tych from the back of the crowd.
 38436	
 38437	âWhy are you here?â he asked.
 38438	
 38439	âYour... your excellency,â stammered AlpÃ¡tych and broke into sobs. âAre
 38440	we really lost? Master!...â
 38441	
 38442	âWhy are you here?â Prince Andrew repeated.
 38443	
 38444	At that moment the flames flared up and showed his young masterâs pale
 38445	worn face. AlpÃ¡tych told how he had been sent there and how difficult it
 38446	was to get away.
 38447	
 38448	âAre we really quite lost, your excellency?â he asked again.
 38449	
 38450	Prince Andrew without replying took out a notebook and raising his knee
 38451	began writing in pencil on a page he tore out. He wrote to his sister:
 38452	
 38453	âSmolÃ©nsk is being abandoned. Bald Hills will be occupied by the enemy
 38454	within a week. Set off immediately for Moscow. Let me know at once when
 38455	you will start. Send by special messenger to UsvyÃ¡zh.â
 38456	
 38457	Having written this and given the paper to AlpÃ¡tych, he told him how
 38458	to arrange for departure of the prince, the princess, his son, and the
 38459	boyâs tutor, and how and where to let him know immediately. Before
 38460	he had had time to finish giving these instructions, a chief of staff
 38461	followed by a suite galloped up to him.
 38462	
 38463	âYou are a colonel?â shouted the chief of staff with a German accent,
 38464	in a voice familiar to Prince Andrew. âHouses are set on fire in your
 38465	presence and you stand by! What does this mean? You will answer for
 38466	it!â shouted Berg, who was now assistant to the chief of staff of the
 38467	commander of the left flank of the infantry of the first army, a place,
 38468	as Berg said, âvery agreeable and well en Ã©vidence.â
 38469	
 38470	Prince Andrew looked at him and without replying went on speaking to
 38471	AlpÃ¡tych.
 38472	
 38473	âSo tell them that I shall await a reply till the tenth, and if by the
 38474	tenth I donât receive news that they have all got away I shall have to
 38475	throw up everything and come myself to Bald Hills.â
 38476	
 38477	âPrince,â said Berg, recognizing Prince Andrew, âI only spoke because
 38478	I have to obey orders, because I always do obey exactly.... You must
 38479	please excuse me,â he went on apologetically.
 38480	
 38481	Something cracked in the flames. The fire died down for a moment and
 38482	wreaths of black smoke rolled from under the roof. There was another
 38483	terrible crash and something huge collapsed.
 38484	
 38485	âOu-rou-rou!â yelled the crowd, echoing the crash of the collapsing roof
 38486	of the barn, the burning grain in which diffused a cakelike aroma all
 38487	around. The flames flared up again, lighting the animated, delighted,
 38488	exhausted faces of the spectators.
 38489	
 38490	The man in the frieze coat raised his arms and shouted:
 38491	
 38492	âItâs fine, lads! Now itâs raging... Itâs fine!â
 38493	
 38494	âThatâs the owner himself,â cried several voices.
 38495	
 38496	âWell then,â continued Prince Andrew to AlpÃ¡tych, âreport to them as I
 38497	have told youâ; and not replying a word to Berg who was now mute beside
 38498	him, he touched his horse and rode down the side street.
 38499	
 38500	
 38501	
 38502	
 38503	
 38504	CHAPTER V
 38505	
 38506	From SmolÃ©nsk the troops continued to retreat, followed by the enemy.
 38507	On the tenth of August the regiment Prince Andrew commanded was marching
 38508	along the highroad past the avenue leading to Bald Hills. Heat and
 38509	drought had continued for more than three weeks. Each day fleecy clouds
 38510	floated across the sky and occasionally veiled the sun, but toward
 38511	evening the sky cleared again and the sun set in reddish-brown mist.
 38512	Heavy night dews alone refreshed the earth. The unreaped corn was
 38513	scorched and shed its grain. The marshes dried up. The cattle lowed from
 38514	hunger, finding no food on the sun-parched meadows. Only at night and
 38515	in the forests while the dew lasted was there any freshness. But on the
 38516	road, the highroad along which the troops marched, there was no such
 38517	freshness even at night or when the road passed through the forest; the
 38518	dew was imperceptible on the sandy dust churned up more than six inches
 38519	deep. As soon as day dawned the march began. The artillery and baggage
 38520	wagons moved noiselessly through the deep dust that rose to the very
 38521	hubs of the wheels, and the infantry sank ankle-deep in that soft,
 38522	choking, hot dust that never cooled even at night. Some of this dust
 38523	was kneaded by the feet and wheels, while the rest rose and hung like a
 38524	cloud over the troops, settling in eyes, ears, hair, and nostrils, and
 38525	worst of all in the lungs of the men and beasts as they moved along that
 38526	road. The higher the sun rose the higher rose that cloud of dust, and
 38527	through the screen of its hot fine particles one could look with naked
 38528	eye at the sun, which showed like a huge crimson ball in the unclouded
 38529	sky. There was no wind, and the men choked in that motionless
 38530	atmosphere. They marched with handkerchiefs tied over their noses and
 38531	mouths. When they passed through a village they all rushed to the wells
 38532	and fought for the water and drank it down to the mud.
 38533	
 38534	Prince Andrew was in command of a regiment, and the management of that
 38535	regiment, the welfare of the men and the necessity of receiving
 38536	and giving orders, engrossed him. The burning of SmolÃ©nsk and its
 38537	abandonment made an epoch in his life. A novel feeling of anger against
 38538	the foe made him forget his own sorrow. He was entirely devoted to the
 38539	affairs of his regiment and was considerate and kind to his men and
 38540	officers. In the regiment they called him âour prince,â were proud
 38541	of him and loved him. But he was kind and gentle only to those of his
 38542	regiment, to TimÃ³khin and the likeâpeople quite new to him, belonging
 38543	to a different world and who could not know and understand his past. As
 38544	soon as he came across a former acquaintance or anyone from the
 38545	staff, he bristled up immediately and grew spiteful, ironical, and
 38546	contemptuous. Everything that reminded him of his past was repugnant to
 38547	him, and so in his relations with that former circle he confined himself
 38548	to trying to do his duty and not to be unfair.
 38549	
 38550	In truth everything presented itself in a dark and gloomy light to
 38551	Prince Andrew, especially after the abandonment of SmolÃ©nsk on the sixth
 38552	of August (he considered that it could and should have been defended)
 38553	and after his sick father had had to flee to Moscow, abandoning to
 38554	pillage his dearly beloved Bald Hills which he had built and peopled.
 38555	But despite this, thanks to his regiment, Prince Andrew had something to
 38556	think about entirely apart from general questions. Two days previously
 38557	he had received news that his father, son, and sister had left for
 38558	Moscow; and though there was nothing for him to do at Bald Hills, Prince
 38559	Andrew with a characteristic desire to foment his own grief decided that
 38560	he must ride there.
 38561	
 38562	He ordered his horse to be saddled and, leaving his regiment on the
 38563	march, rode to his fatherâs estate where he had been born and spent his
 38564	childhood. Riding past the pond where there used always to be dozens
 38565	of women chattering as they rinsed their linen or beat it with wooden
 38566	beetles, Prince Andrew noticed that there was not a soul about and that
 38567	the little washing wharf, torn from its place and half submerged, was
 38568	floating on its side in the middle of the pond. He rode to the keeperâs
 38569	lodge. No one at the stone entrance gates of the drive and the door
 38570	stood open. Grass had already begun to grow on the garden paths, and
 38571	horses and calves were straying in the English park. Prince Andrew rode
 38572	up to the hothouse; some of the glass panes were broken, and of the
 38573	trees in tubs some were overturned and others dried up. He called for
 38574	TarÃ¡s the gardener, but no one replied. Having gone round the corner
 38575	of the hothouse to the ornamental garden, he saw that the carved garden
 38576	fence was broken and branches of the plum trees had been torn off with
 38577	the fruit. An old peasant whom Prince Andrew in his childhood had often
 38578	seen at the gate was sitting on a green garden seat, plaiting a bast
 38579	shoe.
 38580	
 38581	He was deaf and did not hear Prince Andrew ride up. He was sitting on
 38582	the seat the old prince used to like to sit on, and beside him strips of
 38583	bast were hanging on the broken and withered branch of a magnolia.
 38584	
 38585	Prince Andrew rode up to the house. Several limes in the old garden had
 38586	been cut down and a piebald mare and her foal were wandering in front of
 38587	the house among the rosebushes. The shutters were all closed, except at
 38588	one window which was open. A little serf boy, seeing Prince Andrew, ran
 38589	into the house. AlpÃ¡tych, having sent his family away, was alone at
 38590	Bald Hills and was sitting indoors reading the Lives of the Saints. On
 38591	hearing that Prince Andrew had come, he went out with his spectacles on
 38592	his nose, buttoning his coat, and, hastily stepping up, without a word
 38593	began weeping and kissing Prince Andrewâs knee.
 38594	
 38595	Then, vexed at his own weakness, he turned away and began to report
 38596	on the position of affairs. Everything precious and valuable had been
 38597	removed to BoguchÃ¡rovo. Seventy quarters of grain had also been carted
 38598	away. The hay and the spring corn, of which AlpÃ¡tych said there had been
 38599	a remarkable crop that year, had been commandeered by the troops and
 38600	mown down while still green. The peasants were ruined; some of them too
 38601	had gone to BoguchÃ¡rovo, only a few remained.
 38602	
 38603	Without waiting to hear him out, Prince Andrew asked:
 38604	
 38605	âWhen did my father and sister leave?â meaning when did they leave for
 38606	Moscow.
 38607	
 38608	AlpÃ¡tych, understanding the question to refer to their departure for
 38609	BoguchÃ¡rovo, replied that they had left on the seventh and again went
 38610	into details concerning the estate management, asking for instructions.
 38611	
 38612	âAm I to let the troops have the oats, and to take a receipt for them?
 38613	We have still six hundred quarters left,â he inquired.
 38614	
 38615	âWhat am I to say to him?â thought Prince Andrew, looking down on the
 38616	old manâs bald head shining in the sun and seeing by the expression on
 38617	his face that the old man himself understood how untimely such questions
 38618	were and only asked them to allay his grief.
 38619	
 38620	âYes, let them have it,â replied Prince Andrew.
 38621	
 38622	âIf you noticed some disorder in the garden,â said AlpÃ¡tych, âit was
 38623	impossible to prevent it. Three regiments have been here and spent
 38624	the night, dragoons mostly. I took down the name and rank of their
 38625	commanding officer, to hand in a complaint about it.â
 38626	
 38627	âWell, and what are you going to do? Will you stay here if the enemy
 38628	occupies the place?â asked Prince Andrew.
 38629	
 38630	AlpÃ¡tych turned his face to Prince Andrew, looked at him, and suddenly
 38631	with a solemn gesture raised his arm.
 38632	
 38633	âHe is my refuge! His will be done!â he exclaimed.
 38634	
 38635	A group of bareheaded peasants was approaching across the meadow toward
 38636	the prince.
 38637	
 38638	âWell, good-by!â said Prince Andrew, bending over to AlpÃ¡tych. âYou
 38639	must go away too, take away what you can and tell the serfs to go to the
 38640	RyazÃ¡n estate or to the one near Moscow.â
 38641	
 38642	AlpÃ¡tych clung to Prince Andrewâs leg and burst into sobs. Gently
 38643	disengaging himself, the prince spurred his horse and rode down the
 38644	avenue at a gallop.
 38645	
 38646	The old man was still sitting in the ornamental garden, like a fly
 38647	impassive on the face of a loved one who is dead, tapping the last on
 38648	which he was making the bast shoe, and two little girls, running out
 38649	from the hot house carrying in their skirts plums they had plucked from
 38650	the trees there, came upon Prince Andrew. On seeing the young master,
 38651	the elder one with frightened look clutched her younger companion by the
 38652	hand and hid with her behind a birch tree, not stopping to pick up some
 38653	green plums they had dropped.
 38654	
 38655	Prince Andrew turned away with startled haste, unwilling to let them
 38656	see that they had been observed. He was sorry for the pretty frightened
 38657	little girl, was afraid of looking at her, and yet felt an irresistible
 38658	desire to do so. A new sensation of comfort and relief came over him
 38659	when, seeing these girls, he realized the existence of other human
 38660	interests entirely aloof from his own and just as legitimate as those
 38661	that occupied him. Evidently these girls passionately desired one
 38662	thingâto carry away and eat those green plums without being caughtâand
 38663	Prince Andrew shared their wish for the success of their enterprise. He
 38664	could not resist looking at them once more. Believing their danger past,
 38665	they sprang from their ambush and, chirruping something in their shrill
 38666	little voices and holding up their skirts, their bare little sunburned
 38667	feet scampered merrily and quickly across the meadow grass.
 38668	
 38669	Prince Andrew was somewhat refreshed by having ridden off the dusty
 38670	highroad along which the troops were moving. But not far from Bald Hills
 38671	he again came out on the road and overtook his regiment at its halting
 38672	place by the dam of a small pond. It was past one oâclock. The sun,
 38673	a red ball through the dust, burned and scorched his back intolerably
 38674	through his black coat. The dust always hung motionless above the buzz
 38675	of talk that came from the resting troops. There was no wind. As he
 38676	crossed the dam Prince Andrew smelled the ooze and freshness of the
 38677	pond. He longed to get into that water, however dirty it might be, and
 38678	he glanced round at the pool from whence came sounds of shrieks and
 38679	laughter. The small, muddy, green pond had risen visibly more than a
 38680	foot, flooding the dam, because it was full of the naked white bodies
 38681	of soldiers with brick-red hands, necks, and faces, who were splashing
 38682	about in it. All this naked white human flesh, laughing and shrieking,
 38683	floundered about in that dirty pool like carp stuffed into a watering
 38684	can, and the suggestion of merriment in that floundering mass rendered
 38685	it specially pathetic.
 38686	
 38687	One fair-haired young soldier of the third company, whom Prince Andrew
 38688	knew and who had a strap round the calf of one leg, crossed himself,
 38689	stepped back to get a good run, and plunged into the water; another,
 38690	a dark noncommissioned officer who was always shaggy, stood up to his
 38691	waist in the water joyfully wriggling his muscular figure and snorted
 38692	with satisfaction as he poured the water over his head with hands
 38693	blackened to the wrists. There were sounds of men slapping one another,
 38694	yelling, and puffing.
 38695	
 38696	Everywhere on the bank, on the dam, and in the pond, there was healthy,
 38697	white, muscular flesh. The officer, TimÃ³khin, with his red little nose,
 38698	standing on the dam wiping himself with a towel, felt confused at seeing
 38699	the prince, but made up his mind to address him nevertheless.
 38700	
 38701	âItâs very nice, your excellency! Wouldnât you like to?â said he.
 38702	
 38703	âItâs dirty,â replied Prince Andrew, making a grimace.
 38704	
 38705	âWeâll clear it out for you in a minute,â said TimÃ³khin, and, still
 38706	undressed, ran off to clear the men out of the pond.
 38707	
 38708	âThe prince wants to bathe.â
 38709	
 38710	âWhat prince? Ours?â said many voices, and the men were in such haste
 38711	to clear out that the prince could hardly stop them. He decided that he
 38712	would rather wash himself with water in the barn.
 38713	
 38714	âFlesh, bodies, cannon fodder!â he thought, and he looked at his own
 38715	naked body and shuddered, not from cold but from a sense of disgust
 38716	and horror he did not himself understand, aroused by the sight of that
 38717	immense number of bodies splashing about in the dirty pond.
 38718	
 38719	
 38720	On the seventh of August Prince BagratiÃ³n wrote as follows from his
 38721	quarters at MikhÃ¡ylovna on the SmolÃ©nsk road:
 38722	
 38723	Dear Count AlÃ©xis AndrÃ©evichâ(He was writing to ArakchÃ©ev but knew that
 38724	his letter would be read by the Emperor, and therefore weighed every
 38725	word in it to the best of his ability.)
 38726	
 38727	I expect the Minister (Barclay de Tolly) has already reported the
 38728	abandonment of SmolÃ©nsk to the enemy. It is pitiable and sad, and
 38729	the whole army is in despair that this most important place has been
 38730	wantonly abandoned. I, for my part, begged him personally most urgently
 38731	and finally wrote him, but nothing would induce him to consent. I swear
 38732	to you on my honor that Napoleon was in such a fix as never before and
 38733	might have lost half his army but could not have taken SmolÃ©nsk. Our
 38734	troops fought, and are fighting, as never before. With fifteen thousand
 38735	men I held the enemy at bay for thirty-five hours and beat him; but he
 38736	would not hold out even for fourteen hours. It is disgraceful, a stain
 38737	on our army, and as for him, he ought, it seems to me, not to live. If
 38738	he reports that our losses were great, it is not true; perhaps about
 38739	four thousand, not more, and not even that; but even were they ten
 38740	thousand, thatâs war! But the enemy has lost masses....
 38741	
 38742	What would it have cost him to hold out for another two days? They would
 38743	have had to retire of their own accord, for they had no water for men
 38744	or horses. He gave me his word he would not retreat, but suddenly sent
 38745	instructions that he was retiring that night. We cannot fight in this
 38746	way, or we may soon bring the enemy to Moscow....
 38747	
 38748	There is a rumor that you are thinking of peace. God forbid that you
 38749	should make peace after all our sacrifices and such insane retreats! You
 38750	would set all Russia against you and everyone of us would feel ashamed
 38751	to wear the uniform. If it has come to thisâwe must fight as long as
 38752	Russia can and as long as there are men able to stand....
 38753	
 38754	One man ought to be in command, and not two. Your Minister may perhaps
 38755	be good as a Minister, but as a general he is not merely bad but
 38756	execrable, yet to him is entrusted the fate of our whole country.... I
 38757	am really frantic with vexation; forgive my writing boldly. It is clear
 38758	that the man who advocates the conclusion of a peace, and that the
 38759	Minister should command the army, does not love our sovereign and
 38760	desires the ruin of us all. So I write you frankly: call out the
 38761	militia. For the Minister is leading these visitors after him to Moscow
 38762	in a most masterly way. The whole army feels great suspicion of the
 38763	Imperial aide-de-camp Wolzogen. He is said to be more Napoleonâs man
 38764	than ours, and he is always advising the Minister. I am not merely civil
 38765	to him but obey him like a corporal, though I am his senior. This is
 38766	painful, but, loving my benefactor and sovereign, I submit. Only I am
 38767	sorry for the Emperor that he entrusts our fine army to such as he.
 38768	Consider that on our retreat we have lost by fatigue and left in the
 38769	hospital more than fifteen thousand men, and had we attacked this would
 38770	not have happened. Tell me, for Godâs sake, what will Russia, our mother
 38771	Russia, say to our being so frightened, and why are we abandoning our
 38772	good and gallant Fatherland to such rabble and implanting feelings of
 38773	hatred and shame in all our subjects? What are we scared at and of whom
 38774	are we afraid? I am not to blame that the Minister is vacillating,
 38775	a coward, dense, dilatory, and has all bad qualities. The whole army
 38776	bewails it and calls down curses upon him....

 38782	CHAPTER VI
 38783	
 38784	Among the innumerable categories applicable to the phenomena of human
 38785	life one may discriminate between those in which substance prevails
 38786	and those in which form prevails. To the latterâas distinguished
 38787	from village, country, provincial, or even Moscow lifeâwe may allot
 38788	Petersburg life, and especially the life of its salons. That life of
 38789	the salons is unchanging. Since the year 1805 we had made peace and had
 38790	again quarreled with Bonaparte and had made constitutions and unmade
 38791	them again, but the salons of Anna PÃ¡vlovna and HÃ©lÃ¨ne remained just
 38792	as they had beenâthe one seven and the other five years before. At Anna
 38793	PÃ¡vlovnaâs they talked with perplexity of Bonaparteâs successes just
 38794	as before and saw in them and in the subservience shown to him by the
 38795	European sovereigns a malicious conspiracy, the sole object of which was
 38796	to cause unpleasantness and anxiety to the court circle of which Anna
 38797	PÃ¡vlovna was the representative. And in HÃ©lÃ¨neâs salon, which RumyÃ¡ntsev
 38798	himself honored with his visits, regarding HÃ©lÃ¨ne as a remarkably
 38799	intelligent woman, they talked with the same ecstasy in 1812 as in 1808
 38800	of the âgreat nationâ and the âgreat man,â and regretted our rupture
 38801	with France, a rupture which, according to them, ought to be promptly
 38802	terminated by peace.
 38803	
 38804	Of late, since the Emperorâs return from the army, there had been some
 38805	excitement in these conflicting salon circles and some demonstrations
 38806	of hostility to one another, but each camp retained its own tendency.
 38807	In Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs circle only those Frenchmen were admitted who were
 38808	deep-rooted legitimists, and patriotic views were expressed to the
 38809	effect that one ought not to go to the French theater and that to
 38810	maintain the French troupe was costing the government as much as a whole
 38811	army corps. The progress of the war was eagerly followed, and only
 38812	the reports most flattering to our army were circulated. In the French
 38813	circle of HÃ©lÃ¨ne and RumyÃ¡ntsev the reports of the cruelty of the
 38814	enemy and of the war were contradicted and all Napoleonâs attempts at
 38815	conciliation were discussed. In that circle they discountenanced those
 38816	who advised hurried preparations for a removal to KazÃ¡n of the court and
 38817	the girlsâ educational establishments under the patronage of the Dowager
 38818	Empress. In HÃ©lÃ¨neâs circle the war in general was regarded as a series
 38819	of formal demonstrations which would very soon end in peace, and the
 38820	view prevailed expressed by BilÃ­binâwho now in Petersburg was quite at
 38821	home in HÃ©lÃ¨neâs house, which every clever man was obliged to visitâthat
 38822	not by gunpowder but by those who invented it would matters be
 38823	settled. In that circle the Moscow enthusiasmânews of which had reached
 38824	Petersburg simultaneously with the Emperorâs returnâwas ridiculed
 38825	sarcastically and very cleverly, though with much caution.
 38826	
 38827	Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs circle on the contrary was enraptured by this enthusiasm
 38828	and spoke of it as Plutarch speaks of the deeds of the ancients.
 38829	Prince VasÃ­li, who still occupied his former important posts, formed a
 38830	connecting link between these two circles. He visited his âgood friend
 38831	Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâ as well as his daughterâs âdiplomatic salon,â and often
 38832	in his constant comings and goings between the two camps became confused
 38833	and said at HÃ©lÃ¨neâs what he should have said at Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs and
 38834	vice versa.
 38835	
 38836	Soon after the Emperorâs return Prince VasÃ­li in a conversation about
 38837	the war at Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs severely condemned Barclay de Tolly, but was
 38838	undecided as to who ought to be appointed commander in chief. One of the
 38839	visitors, usually spoken of as âa man of great merit,â having described
 38840	how he had that day seen KutÃºzov, the newly chosen chief of the
 38841	Petersburg militia, presiding over the enrollment of recruits at the
 38842	Treasury, cautiously ventured to suggest that KutÃºzov would be the man
 38843	to satisfy all requirements.
 38844	
 38845	Anna PÃ¡vlovna remarked with a melancholy smile that KutÃºzov had done
 38846	nothing but cause the Emperor annoyance.
 38847	
 38848	âI have talked and talked at the Assembly of the Nobility,â Prince
 38849	VasÃ­li interrupted, âbut they did not listen to me. I told them his
 38850	election as chief of the militia would not please the Emperor. They did
 38851	not listen to me.
 38852	
 38853	âItâs all this mania for opposition,â he went on. âAnd who for? It is
 38854	all because we want to ape the foolish enthusiasm of those Muscovites,â
 38855	Prince VasÃ­li continued, forgetting for a moment that though at HÃ©lÃ¨neâs
 38856	one had to ridicule the Moscow enthusiasm, at Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs one had to
 38857	be ecstatic about it. But he retrieved his mistake at once. âNow, is
 38858	it suitable that Count KutÃºzov, the oldest general in Russia, should
 38859	preside at that tribunal? He will get nothing for his pains! How could
 38860	they make a man commander in chief who cannot mount a horse, who drops
 38861	asleep at a council, and has the very worst morals! A good reputation
 38862	he made for himself at Bucharest! I donât speak of his capacity as a
 38863	general, but at a time like this how they appoint a decrepit, blind old
 38864	man, positively blind? A fine idea to have a blind general! He canât see
 38865	anything. To play blindmanâs buff? He canât see at all!â
 38866	
 38867	No one replied to his remarks.
 38868	
 38869	This was quite correct on the twenty-fourth of July. But on the
 38870	twenty-ninth of July KutÃºzov received the title of Prince. This might
 38871	indicate a wish to get rid of him, and therefore Prince VasÃ­liâs opinion
 38872	continued to be correct though he was not now in any hurry to express
 38873	it. But on the eighth of August a committee, consisting of Field Marshal
 38874	SaltykÃ³v, ArakchÃ©ev, VyazmÃ­tinov, LopukhÃ­n, and KochubÃ©y met to consider
 38875	the progress of the war. This committee came to the conclusion that
 38876	our failures were due to a want of unity in the command and though the
 38877	members of the committee were aware of the Emperorâs dislike of KutÃºzov,
 38878	after a short deliberation they agreed to advise his appointment as
 38879	commander in chief. That same day KutÃºzov was appointed commander
 38880	in chief with full powers over the armies and over the whole region
 38881	occupied by them.
 38882	
 38883	On the ninth of August Prince VasÃ­li at Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs again met the
 38884	âman of great merit.â The latter was very attentive to Anna PÃ¡vlovna
 38885	because he wanted to be appointed director of one of the educational
 38886	establishments for young ladies. Prince VasÃ­li entered the room with the
 38887	air of a happy conqueror who has attained the object of his desires.
 38888	
 38889	âWell, have you heard the great news? Prince KutÃºzov is field marshal!
 38890	All dissensions are at an end! I am so glad, so delighted! At last
 38891	we have a man!â said he, glancing sternly and significantly round at
 38892	everyone in the drawing room.
 38893	
 38894	The âman of great merit,â despite his desire to obtain the post of
 38895	director, could not refrain from reminding Prince VasÃ­li of his former
 38896	opinion. Though this was impolite to Prince VasÃ­li in Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs
 38897	drawing room, and also to Anna PÃ¡vlovna herself who had received the
 38898	news with delight, he could not resist the temptation.
 38899	
 38900	âBut, Prince, they say he is blind!â said he, reminding Prince VasÃ­li of
 38901	his own words.
 38902	
 38903	âEh? Nonsense! He sees well enough,â said Prince VasÃ­li rapidly, in a
 38904	deep voice and with a slight coughâthe voice and cough with which he was
 38905	wont to dispose of all difficulties.
 38906	
 38907	âHe sees well enough,â he added. âAnd what I am so pleased about,â he
 38908	went on, âis that our sovereign has given him full powers over all
 38909	the armies and the whole regionâpowers no commander in chief ever had
 38910	before. He is a second autocrat,â he concluded with a victorious smile.
 38911	
 38912	âGod grant it! God grant it!â said Anna PÃ¡vlovna.
 38913	
 38914	The âman of great merit,â who was still a novice in court circles,
 38915	wishing to flatter Anna PÃ¡vlovna by defending her former position on
 38916	this question, observed:
 38917	
 38918	âIt is said that the Emperor was reluctant to give KutÃºzov those powers.
 38919	They say he blushed like a girl to whom Joconde is read, when he said to
 38920	KutÃºzov: âYour Emperor and the Fatherland award you this honor.ââ
 38921	
 38922	âPerhaps the heart took no part in that speech,â said Anna PÃ¡vlovna.
 38923	
 38924	âOh, no, no!â warmly rejoined Prince VasÃ­li, who would not now yield
 38925	KutÃºzov to anyone; in his opinion KutÃºzov was not only admirable
 38926	himself, but was adored by everybody. âNo, thatâs impossible,â said he,
 38927	âfor our sovereign appreciated him so highly before.â
 38928	
 38929	âGod grant only that Prince KutÃºzov assumes real power and does not
 38930	allow anyone to put a spoke in his wheel,â observed Anna PÃ¡vlovna.
 38931	
 38932	Understanding at once to whom she alluded, Prince VasÃ­li said in a
 38933	whisper:
 38934	
 38935	âI know for a fact that KutÃºzov made it an absolute condition that the
 38936	TsarÃ©vich should not be with the army. Do you know what he said to the
 38937	Emperor?â
 38938	
 38939	And Prince VasÃ­li repeated the words supposed to have been spoken by
 38940	KutÃºzov to the Emperor. âI can neither punish him if he does wrong nor
 38941	reward him if he does right.â
 38942	
 38943	âOh, a very wise man is Prince KutÃºzov! I have known him a long time!â
 38944	
 38945	âThey even say,â remarked the âman of great meritâ who did not yet
 38946	possess courtly tact, âthat his excellency made it an express condition
 38947	that the sovereign himself should not be with the army.â
 38948	
 38949	As soon as he said this both Prince VasÃ­li and Anna PÃ¡vlovna turned away
 38950	from him and glanced sadly at one another with a sigh at his naÃ¯vetÃ©.
 38951	
 38952	
 38953	
 38954	
 38955	
 38956	CHAPTER VII
 38957	
 38958	While this was taking place in Petersburg the French had already passed
 38959	SmolÃ©nsk and were drawing nearer and nearer to Moscow. Napoleonâs
 38960	historian Thiers, like other of his historians, trying to justify his
 38961	hero says that he was drawn to the walls of Moscow against his will. He
 38962	is as right as other historians who look for the explanation of historic
 38963	events in the will of one man; he is as right as the Russian historians
 38964	who maintain that Napoleon was drawn to Moscow by the skill of the
 38965	Russian commanders. Here besides the law of retrospection, which regards
 38966	all the past as a preparation for events that subsequently occur,
 38967	the law of reciprocity comes in, confusing the whole matter. A good
 38968	chessplayer having lost a game is sincerely convinced that his loss
 38969	resulted from a mistake he made and looks for that mistake in the
 38970	opening, but forgets that at each stage of the game there were similar
 38971	mistakes and that none of his moves were perfect. He only notices the
 38972	mistake to which he pays attention, because his opponent took advantage
 38973	of it. How much more complex than this is the game of war, which
 38974	occurs under certain limits of time, and where it is not one will that
 38975	manipulates lifeless objects, but everything results from innumerable
 38976	conflicts of various wills!
 38977	
 38978	After SmolÃ©nsk Napoleon sought a battle beyond DorogobÃºzh at VyÃ¡zma, and
 38979	then at TsÃ¡revo-ZaymÃ­shche, but it happened that owing to a conjunction
 38980	of innumerable circumstances the Russians could not give battle till
 38981	they reached BorodinÃ³, seventy miles from Moscow. From VyÃ¡zma Napoleon
 38982	ordered a direct advance on Moscow.
 38983	
 38984	Moscou, la capitale asiatique de ce grand empire, la ville sacrÃ©e des
 38985	peuples dâAlexandre, Moscou avec ses innombrables Ã©glises en forme de
 38986	pagodes chinoises, * this Moscow gave Napoleonâs imagination no rest.
 38987	On the march from VyÃ¡zma to TsÃ¡revo-ZaymÃ­shche he rode his light bay
 38988	bobtailed ambler accompanied by his Guards, his bodyguard, his pages,
 38989	and aides-de-camp. Berthier, his chief of staff, dropped behind to
 38990	question a Russian prisoner captured by the cavalry. Followed by
 38991	Lelorgne dâIdeville, an interpreter, he overtook Napoleon at a gallop
 38992	and reined in his horse with an amused expression.
 38993	
 38994	     * âMoscow, the Asiatic capital of this great empire, the
 38995	     sacred city of Alexanderâs people, Moscow with its
 38996	     innumerable churches shaped like Chinese pagodas.â
 38997	
 38998	
 38999	âWell?â asked Napoleon.
 39000	
 39001	âOne of PlÃ¡tovâs Cossacks says that PlÃ¡tovâs corps is joining up with
 39002	the main army and that KutÃºzov has been appointed commander in chief. He
 39003	is a very shrewd and garrulous fellow.â
 39004	
 39005	Napoleon smiled and told them to give the Cossack a horse and bring the
 39006	man to him. He wished to talk to him himself. Several adjutants galloped
 39007	off, and an hour later, LavrÃºshka, the serf DenÃ­sov had handed over
 39008	to RostÃ³v, rode up to Napoleon in an orderlyâs jacket and on a French
 39009	cavalry saddle, with a merry, and tipsy face. Napoleon told him to ride
 39010	by his side and began questioning him.
 39011	
 39012	âYou are a Cossack?â
 39013	
 39014	âYes, a Cossack, your Honor.â
 39015	
 39016	âThe Cossack, not knowing in what company he was, for Napoleonâs plain
 39017	appearance had nothing about it that would reveal to an Oriental mind
 39018	the presence of a monarch, talked with extreme familiarity of the
 39019	incidents of the war,â says Thiers, narrating this episode. In
 39020	reality LavrÃºshka, having got drunk the day before and left his master
 39021	dinnerless, had been whipped and sent to the village in quest of
 39022	chickens, where he engaged in looting till the French took him prisoner.
 39023	LavrÃºshka was one of those coarse, bare-faced lackeys who have seen all
 39024	sorts of things, consider it necessary to do everything in a mean and
 39025	cunning way, are ready to render any sort of service to their master,
 39026	and are keen at guessing their masterâs baser impulses, especially those
 39027	prompted by vanity and pettiness.
 39028	
 39029	Finding himself in the company of Napoleon, whose identity he had easily
 39030	and surely recognized, LavrÃºshka was not in the least abashed but merely
 39031	did his utmost to gain his new masterâs favor.
 39032	
 39033	He knew very well that this was Napoleon, but Napoleonâs presence could
 39034	no more intimidate him than RostÃ³vâs, or a sergeant majorâs with the
 39035	rods, would have done, for he had nothing that either the sergeant major
 39036	or Napoleon could deprive him of.
 39037	
 39038	So he rattled on, telling all the gossip he had heard among the
 39039	orderlies. Much of it true. But when Napoleon asked him whether the
 39040	Russians thought they would beat Bonaparte or not, LavrÃºshka screwed up
 39041	his eyes and considered.
 39042	
 39043	In this question he saw subtle cunning, as men of his type see cunning
 39044	in everything, so he frowned and did not answer immediately.
 39045	
 39046	âItâs like this,â he said thoughtfully, âif thereâs a battle soon, yours
 39047	will win. Thatâs right. But if three days pass, then after that, well,
 39048	then that same battle will not soon be over.â
 39049	
 39050	Lelorgne dâIdeville smilingly interpreted this speech to Napoleon thus:
 39051	âIf a battle takes place within the next three days the French will
 39052	win, but if later, God knows what will happen.â Napoleon did not smile,
 39053	though he was evidently in high good humor, and he ordered these words
 39054	to be repeated.
 39055	
 39056	LavrÃºshka noticed this and to entertain him further, pretending not to
 39057	know who Napoleon was, added:
 39058	
 39059	âWe know that you have Bonaparte and that he has beaten everybody in the
 39060	world, but we are a different matter...ââwithout knowing why or how this
 39061	bit of boastful patriotism slipped out at the end.
 39062	
 39063	The interpreter translated these words without the last phrase, and
 39064	Bonaparte smiled. âThe young Cossack made his mighty interlocutor
 39065	smile,â says Thiers. After riding a few paces in silence, Napoleon
 39066	turned to Berthier and said he wished to see how the news that he was
 39067	talking to the Emperor himself, to that very Emperor who had written his
 39068	immortally victorious name on the Pyramids, would affect this enfant du
 39069	Don. *
 39070	
 39071	    * âChild of the Don.â
 39072	
 39073	
 39074	The fact was accordingly conveyed to LavrÃºshka.
 39075	
 39076	LavrÃºshka, understanding that this was done to perplex him and that
 39077	Napoleon expected him to be frightened, to gratify his new masters
 39078	promptly pretended to be astonished and awe-struck, opened his eyes
 39079	wide, and assumed the expression he usually put on when taken to be
 39080	whipped. âAs soon as Napoleonâs interpreter had spoken,â says Thiers,
 39081	âthe Cossack, seized by amazement, did not utter another word, but rode
 39082	on, his eyes fixed on the conqueror whose fame had reached him across
 39083	the steppes of the East. All his loquacity was suddenly arrested and
 39084	replaced by a naÃ¯ve and silent feeling of admiration. Napoleon, after
 39085	making the Cossack a present, had him set free like a bird restored to
 39086	its native fields.â
 39087	
 39088	Napoleon rode on, dreaming of the Moscow that so appealed to his
 39089	imagination, and âthe bird restored to its native fieldsâ galloped to
 39090	our outposts, inventing on the way all that had not taken place but that
 39091	he meant to relate to his comrades. What had really taken place he did
 39092	not wish to relate because it seemed to him not worth telling. He
 39093	found the Cossacks, inquired for the regiment operating with PlÃ¡tovâs
 39094	detachment and by evening found his master, Nicholas RostÃ³v, quartered
 39095	at YankÃ³vo. RostÃ³v was just mounting to go for a ride round the
 39096	neighboring villages with IlyÃ­n; he let LavrÃºshka have another horse and
 39097	took him along with him.

 39105	Princess Mary was not in Moscow and out of danger as Prince Andrew
 39106	supposed.
 39107	
 39108	After the return of AlpÃ¡tych from SmolÃ©nsk the old prince suddenly
 39109	seemed to awake as from a dream. He ordered the militiamen to be called
 39110	up from the villages and armed, and wrote a letter to the commander in
 39111	chief informing him that he had resolved to remain at Bald Hills to the
 39112	last extremity and to defend it, leaving to the commander in chiefâs
 39113	discretion to take measures or not for the defense of Bald Hills, where
 39114	one of Russiaâs oldest generals would be captured or killed, and he
 39115	announced to his household that he would remain at Bald Hills.
 39116	
 39117	But while himself remaining, he gave instructions for the departure of
 39118	the princess and Dessalles with the little prince to BoguchÃ¡rovo and
 39119	thence to Moscow. Princess Mary, alarmed by her fatherâs feverish and
 39120	sleepless activity after his previous apathy, could not bring herself to
 39121	leave him alone and for the first time in her life ventured to disobey
 39122	him. She refused to go away and her fatherâs fury broke over her in a
 39123	terrible storm. He repeated every injustice he had ever inflicted on
 39124	her. Trying to convict her, he told her she had worn him out, had caused
 39125	his quarrel with his son, had harbored nasty suspicions of him, making
 39126	it the object of her life to poison his existence, and he drove her from
 39127	his study telling her that if she did not go away it was all the same
 39128	to him. He declared that he did not wish to remember her existence and
 39129	warned her not to dare to let him see her. The fact that he did not, as
 39130	she had feared, order her to be carried away by force but only told her
 39131	not to let him see her cheered Princess Mary. She knew it was a proof
 39132	that in the depth of his soul he was glad she was remaining at home and
 39133	had not gone away.
 39134	
 39135	The morning after little Nicholas had left, the old prince donned his
 39136	full uniform and prepared to visit the commander in chief. His calÃ¨che
 39137	was already at the door. Princess Mary saw him walk out of the house in
 39138	his uniform wearing all his orders and go down the garden to review his
 39139	armed peasants and domestic serfs. She sat by the window listening to
 39140	his voice which reached her from the garden. Suddenly several men came
 39141	running up the avenue with frightened faces.
 39142	
 39143	Princess Mary ran out to the porch, down the flower-bordered path, and
 39144	into the avenue. A large crowd of militiamen and domestics were moving
 39145	toward her, and in their midst several men were supporting by
 39146	the armpits and dragging along a little old man in a uniform and
 39147	decorations. She ran up to him and, in the play of the sunlight that
 39148	fell in small round spots through the shade of the lime-tree avenue,
 39149	could not be sure what change there was in his face. All she could see
 39150	was that his former stern and determined expression had altered to one
 39151	of timidity and submission. On seeing his daughter he moved his helpless
 39152	lips and made a hoarse sound. It was impossible to make out what he
 39153	wanted. He was lifted up, carried to his study, and laid on the very
 39154	couch he had so feared of late.
 39155	
 39156	The doctor, who was fetched that same night, bled him and said that the
 39157	prince had had a seizure paralyzing his right side.
 39158	
 39159	It was becoming more and more dangerous to remain at Bald Hills, and
 39160	next day they moved the prince to BoguchÃ¡rovo, the doctor accompanying
 39161	him.
 39162	
 39163	By the time they reached BoguchÃ¡rovo, Dessalles and the little prince
 39164	had already left for Moscow.
 39165	
 39166	For three weeks the old prince lay stricken by paralysis in the new
 39167	house Prince Andrew had built at BoguchÃ¡rovo, ever in the same state,
 39168	getting neither better nor worse. He was unconscious and lay like
 39169	a distorted corpse. He muttered unceasingly, his eyebrows and lips
 39170	twitching, and it was impossible to tell whether he understood what was
 39171	going on around him or not. One thing was certainâthat he was suffering
 39172	and wished to say something. But what it was, no one could tell: it
 39173	might be some caprice of a sick and half-crazy man, or it might relate
 39174	to public affairs, or possibly to family concerns.
 39175	
 39176	The doctor said this restlessness did not mean anything and was due
 39177	to physical causes; but Princess Mary thought he wished to tell
 39178	her something, and the fact that her presence always increased his
 39179	restlessness confirmed her opinion.
 39180	
 39181	He was evidently suffering both physically and mentally. There was no
 39182	hope of recovery. It was impossible for him to travel, it would not do
 39183	to let him die on the road. âWould it not be better if the end did come,
 39184	the very end?â Princess Mary sometimes thought. Night and day, hardly
 39185	sleeping at all, she watched him and, terrible to say, often watched
 39186	him not with hope of finding signs of improvement but wishing to find
 39187	symptoms of the approach of the end.
 39188	
 39189	Strange as it was to her to acknowledge this feeling in herself, yet
 39190	there it was. And what seemed still more terrible to her was that since
 39191	her fatherâs illness began (perhaps even sooner, when she stayed with
 39192	him expecting something to happen), all the personal desires and hopes
 39193	that had been forgotten or sleeping within her had awakened. Thoughts
 39194	that had not entered her mind for yearsâthoughts of a life free from
 39195	the fear of her father, and even the possibility of love and of family
 39196	happinessâfloated continually in her imagination like temptations of the
 39197	devil. Thrust them aside as she would, questions continually recurred
 39198	to her as to how she would order her life now, after that. These were
 39199	temptations of the devil and Princess Mary knew it. She knew that the
 39200	sole weapon against him was prayer, and she tried to pray. She assumed
 39201	an attitude of prayer, looked at the icons, repeated the words of a
 39202	prayer, but she could not pray. She felt that a different world had
 39203	now taken possession of herâthe life of a world of strenuous and free
 39204	activity, quite opposed to the spiritual world in which till now she
 39205	had been confined and in which her greatest comfort had been prayer.
 39206	She could not pray, could not weep, and worldly cares took possession of
 39207	her.
 39208	
 39209	It was becoming dangerous to remain in BoguchÃ¡rovo. News of the approach
 39210	of the French came from all sides, and in one village, ten miles from
 39211	BoguchÃ¡rovo, a homestead had been looted by French marauders.
 39212	
 39213	The doctor insisted on the necessity of moving the prince; the
 39214	provincial Marshal of the Nobility sent an official to Princess Mary
 39215	to persuade her to get away as quickly as possible, and the head of the
 39216	rural police having come to BoguchÃ¡rovo urged the same thing, saying
 39217	that the French were only some twenty-five miles away, that French
 39218	proclamations were circulating in the villages, and that if the princess
 39219	did not take her father away before the fifteenth, he could not answer
 39220	for the consequences.
 39221	
 39222	The princess decided to leave on the fifteenth. The cares of preparation
 39223	and giving orders, for which everyone came to her, occupied her all day.
 39224	She spent the night of the fourteenth as usual, without undressing, in
 39225	the room next to the one where the prince lay. Several times, waking up,
 39226	she heard his groans and muttering, the creak of his bed, and the steps
 39227	of TÃ­khon and the doctor when they turned him over. Several times she
 39228	listened at the door, and it seemed to her that his mutterings were
 39229	louder than usual and that they turned him over oftener. She could not
 39230	sleep and several times went to the door and listened, wishing to enter
 39231	but not deciding to do so. Though he did not speak, Princess Mary saw
 39232	and knew how unpleasant every sign of anxiety on his account was to him.
 39233	She had noticed with what dissatisfaction he turned from the look she
 39234	sometimes involuntarily fixed on him. She knew that her going in during
 39235	the night at an unusual hour would irritate him.
 39236	
 39237	But never had she felt so grieved for him or so much afraid of losing
 39238	him. She recalled all her life with him and in every word and act of his
 39239	found an expression of his love of her. Occasionally amid these memories
 39240	temptations of the devil would surge into her imagination: thoughts of
 39241	how things would be after his death, and how her new, liberated life
 39242	would be ordered. But she drove these thoughts away with disgust. Toward
 39243	morning he became quiet and she fell asleep.
 39244	
 39245	She woke late. That sincerity which often comes with waking showed her
 39246	clearly what chiefly concerned her about her fatherâs illness. On waking
 39247	she listened to what was going on behind the door and, hearing him
 39248	groan, said to herself with a sigh that things were still the same.
 39249	
 39250	âBut what could have happened? What did I want? I want his death!â she
 39251	cried with a feeling of loathing for herself.
 39252	
 39253	She washed, dressed, said her prayers, and went out to the porch. In
 39254	front of it stood carriages without horses and things were being packed
 39255	into the vehicles.
 39256	
 39257	It was a warm, gray morning. Princess Mary stopped at the porch, still
 39258	horrified by her spiritual baseness and trying to arrange her thoughts
 39259	before going to her father. The doctor came downstairs and went out to
 39260	her.
 39261	
 39262	âHe is a little better today,â said he. âI was looking for you. One can
 39263	make out something of what he is saying. His head is clearer. Come in,
 39264	he is asking for you....â
 39265	
 39266	Princess Maryâs heart beat so violently at this news that she grew pale
 39267	and leaned against the wall to keep from falling. To see him, talk to
 39268	him, feel his eyes on her now that her whole soul was overflowing with
 39269	those dreadful, wicked temptations, was a torment of joy and terror.
 39270	
 39271	âCome,â said the doctor.
 39272	
 39273	Princess Mary entered her fatherâs room and went up to his bed. He was
 39274	lying on his back propped up high, and his small bony hands with
 39275	their knotted purple veins were lying on the quilt; his left eye gazed
 39276	straight before him, his right eye was awry, and his brows and lips
 39277	motionless. He seemed altogether so thin, small, and pathetic. His face
 39278	seemed to have shriveled or melted; his features had grown smaller.
 39279	Princess Mary went up and kissed his hand. His left hand pressed hers
 39280	so that she understood that he had long been waiting for her to come. He
 39281	twitched her hand, and his brows and lips quivered angrily.
 39282	
 39283	She looked at him in dismay trying to guess what he wanted of her. When
 39284	she changed her position so that his left eye could see her face he
 39285	calmed down, not taking his eyes off her for some seconds. Then his lips
 39286	and tongue moved, sounds came, and he began to speak, gazing timidly and
 39287	imploringly at her, evidently afraid that she might not understand.
 39288	
 39289	Straining all her faculties Princess Mary looked at him. The comic
 39290	efforts with which he moved his tongue made her drop her eyes and with
 39291	difficulty repress the sobs that rose to her throat. He said something,
 39292	repeating the same words several times. She could not understand them,
 39293	but tried to guess what he was saying and inquiringly repeated the words
 39294	he uttered.
 39295	
 39296	âMmm...ar...ate...ate...â he repeated several times.
 39297	
 39298	It was quite impossible to understand these sounds. The doctor thought
 39299	he had guessed them, and inquiringly repeated: âMary, are you afraid?â
 39300	The prince shook his head, again repeated the same sounds.
 39301	
 39302	âMy mind, my mind aches?â questioned Princess Mary.
 39303	
 39304	He made a mumbling sound in confirmation of this, took her hand, and
 39305	began pressing it to different parts of his breast as if trying to find
 39306	the right place for it.
 39307	
 39308	âAlways thoughts... about you... thoughts...â he then uttered much
 39309	more clearly than he had done before, now that he was sure of being
 39310	understood.
 39311	
 39312	Princess Mary pressed her head against his hand, trying to hide her sobs
 39313	and tears.
 39314	
 39315	He moved his hand over her hair.
 39316	
 39317	âI have been calling you all night...â he brought out.
 39318	
 39319	âIf only I had known...â she said through her tears. âI was afraid to
 39320	come in.â
 39321	
 39322	He pressed her hand.
 39323	
 39324	âWerenât you asleep?â
 39325	
 39326	âNo, I did not sleep,â said Princess Mary, shaking her head.
 39327	
 39328	Unconsciously imitating her father, she now tried to express herself as
 39329	he did, as much as possible by signs, and her tongue too seemed to move
 39330	with difficulty.
 39331	
 39332	âDear one... Dearest...â Princess Mary could not quite make out what he
 39333	had said, but from his look it was clear that he had uttered a tender
 39334	caressing word such as he had never used to her before. âWhy didnât you
 39335	come in?â
 39336	
 39337	âAnd I was wishing for his death!â thought Princess Mary.
 39338	
 39339	He was silent awhile.
 39340	
 39341	âThank you... daughter dear!... for all, for all... forgive!... thank
 39342	you!... forgive!... thank you!...â and tears began to flow from his
 39343	eyes. âCall Andrew!â he said suddenly, and a childish, timid expression
 39344	of doubt showed itself on his face as he spoke.
 39345	
 39346	He himself seemed aware that his demand was meaningless. So at least it
 39347	seemed to Princess Mary.
 39348	
 39349	âI have a letter from him,â she replied.
 39350	
 39351	He glanced at her with timid surprise.
 39352	
 39353	âWhere is he?â
 39354	
 39355	âHeâs with the army, Father, at SmolÃ©nsk.â
 39356	
 39357	He closed his eyes and remained silent a long time. Then as if in
 39358	answer to his doubts and to confirm the fact that now he understood and
 39359	remembered everything, he nodded his head and reopened his eyes.
 39360	
 39361	âYes,â he said, softly and distinctly. âRussia has perished. Theyâve
 39362	destroyed her.â
 39363	
 39364	And he began to sob, and again tears flowed from his eyes. Princess Mary
 39365	could no longer restrain herself and wept while she gazed at his face.
 39366	
 39367	Again he closed his eyes. His sobs ceased, he pointed to his eyes, and
 39368	TÃ­khon, understanding him, wiped away the tears.
 39369	
 39370	Then he again opened his eyes and said something none of them could
 39371	understand for a long time, till at last TÃ­khon understood and repeated
 39372	it. Princess Mary had sought the meaning of his words in the mood in
 39373	which he had just been speaking. She thought he was speaking of Russia,
 39374	or Prince Andrew, of herself, of his grandson, or of his own death, and
 39375	so she could not guess his words.
 39376	
 39377	âPut on your white dress. I like it,â was what he said.
 39378	
 39379	Having understood this Princess Mary sobbed still louder, and the doctor
 39380	taking her arm led her out to the veranda, soothing her and trying to
 39381	persuade her to prepare for her journey. When she had left the room the
 39382	prince again began speaking about his son, about the war, and about the
 39383	Emperor, angrily twitching his brows and raising his hoarse voice, and
 39384	then he had a second and final stroke.
 39385	
 39386	Princess Mary stayed on the veranda. The day had cleared, it was hot and
 39387	sunny. She could understand nothing, think of nothing and feel nothing,
 39388	except passionate love for her father, love such as she thought she had
 39389	never felt till that moment. She ran out sobbing into the garden and as
 39390	far as the pond, along the avenues of young lime trees Prince Andrew had
 39391	planted.
 39392	
 39393	âYes... I... I... I wished for his death! Yes, I wanted it to end
 39394	quicker.... I wished to be at peace.... And what will become of me? What
 39395	use will peace be when he is no longer here?â Princess Mary murmured,
 39396	pacing the garden with hurried steps and pressing her hands to her bosom
 39397	which heaved with convulsive sobs.
 39398	
 39399	When she had completed the tour of the garden, which brought her
 39400	again to the house, she saw Mademoiselle Bourienneâwho had remained
 39401	at BoguchÃ¡rovo and did not wish to leave itâcoming toward her with a
 39402	stranger. This was the Marshal of the Nobility of the district, who
 39403	had come personally to point out to the princess the necessity for her
 39404	prompt departure. Princess Mary listened without understanding him; she
 39405	led him to the house, offered him lunch, and sat down with him. Then,
 39406	excusing herself, she went to the door of the old princeâs room. The
 39407	doctor came out with an agitated face and said she could not enter.
 39408	
 39409	âGo away, Princess! Go away... go away!â
 39410	
 39411	She returned to the garden and sat down on the grass at the foot of the
 39412	slope by the pond, where no one could see her. She did not know how
 39413	long she had been there when she was aroused by the sound of a womanâs
 39414	footsteps running along the path. She rose and saw DunyÃ¡sha her maid,
 39415	who was evidently looking for her, and who stopped suddenly as if in
 39416	alarm on seeing her mistress.
 39417	
 39418	âPlease come, Princess... The Prince,â said DunyÃ¡sha in a breaking
 39419	voice.
 39420	
 39421	âImmediately, Iâm coming, Iâm coming!â replied the princess hurriedly,
 39422	not giving DunyÃ¡sha time to finish what she was saying, and trying to
 39423	avoid seeing the girl she ran toward the house.
 39424	
 39425	âPrincess, itâs Godâs will! You must be prepared for everything,â said
 39426	the Marshal, meeting her at the house door.
 39427	
 39428	âLet me alone; itâs not true!â she cried angrily to him.
 39429	
 39430	The doctor tried to stop her. She pushed him aside and ran to her
 39431	fatherâs door. âWhy are these people with frightened faces stopping me?
 39432	I donât want any of them! And what are they doing here?â she thought.
 39433	She opened the door and the bright daylight in that previously darkened
 39434	room startled her. In the room were her nurse and other women. They all
 39435	drew back from the bed, making way for her. He was still lying on the
 39436	bed as before, but the stern expression of his quiet face made Princess
 39437	Mary stop short on the threshold.
 39438	
 39439	âNo, heâs not deadâitâs impossible!â she told herself and approached
 39440	him, and repressing the terror that seized her, she pressed her lips
 39441	to his cheek. But she stepped back immediately. All the force of the
 39442	tenderness she had been feeling for him vanished instantly and was
 39443	replaced by a feeling of horror at what lay there before her. âNo, he
 39444	is no more! He is not, but here where he was is something unfamiliar and
 39445	hostile, some dreadful, terrifying, and repellent mystery!â And hiding
 39446	her face in her hands, Princess Mary sank into the arms of the doctor,
 39447	who held her up.
 39448	
 39449	
 39450	In the presence of TÃ­khon and the doctor the women washed what had been
 39451	the prince, tied his head up with a handkerchief that the mouth should
 39452	not stiffen while open, and with another handkerchief tied together the
 39453	legs that were already spreading apart. Then they dressed him in uniform
 39454	with his decorations and placed his shriveled little body on a table.
 39455	Heaven only knows who arranged all this and when, but it all got done
 39456	as if of its own accord. Toward night candles were burning round his
 39457	coffin, a pall was spread over it, the floor was strewn with sprays of
 39458	juniper, a printed band was tucked in under his shriveled head, and in a
 39459	corner of the room sat a chanter reading the psalms.
 39460	
 39461	Just as horses shy and snort and gather about a dead horse, so the
 39462	inmates of the house and strangers crowded into the drawing room round
 39463	the coffinâthe Marshal, the village Elder, peasant womenâand all with
 39464	fixed and frightened eyes, crossing themselves, bowed and kissed the old
 39465	princeâs cold and stiffened hand.
 39466	
 39467	
 39468	
 39469	
 39470	
 39471	CHAPTER IX
 39472	
 39473	Until Prince Andrew settled in BoguchÃ¡rovo its owners had always been
 39474	absentees, and its peasants were of quite a different character from
 39475	those of Bald Hills. They differed from them in speech, dress, and
 39476	disposition. They were called steppe peasants. The old prince used to
 39477	approve of them for their endurance at work when they came to Bald Hills
 39478	to help with the harvest or to dig ponds, and ditches, but he disliked
 39479	them for their boorishness.
 39480	
 39481	Prince Andrewâs last stay at BoguchÃ¡rovo, when he introduced hospitals
 39482	and schools and reduced the quitrent the peasants had to pay, had not
 39483	softened their disposition but had on the contrary strengthened in
 39484	them the traits of character the old prince called boorishness. Various
 39485	obscure rumors were always current among them: at one time a rumor that
 39486	they would all be enrolled as Cossacks; at another of a new religion to
 39487	which they were all to be converted; then of some proclamation of the
 39488	Tsarâs and of an oath to the Tsar Paul in 1797 (in connection with which
 39489	it was rumored that freedom had been granted them but the landowners had
 39490	stopped it), then of Peter FÃ«dorovichâs return to the throne in seven
 39491	yearsâ time, when everything would be made free and so âsimpleâ that
 39492	there would be no restrictions. Rumors of the war with Bonaparte and
 39493	his invasion were connected in their minds with the same sort of vague
 39494	notions of Antichrist, the end of the world, and âpure freedom.â
 39495	
 39496	In the vicinity of BoguchÃ¡rovo were large villages belonging to the
 39497	crown or to owners whose serfs paid quitrent and could work where they
 39498	pleased. There were very few resident landlords in the neighborhood
 39499	and also very few domestic or literate serfs, and in the lives of the
 39500	peasantry of those parts the mysterious undercurrents in the life of
 39501	the Russian people, the causes and meaning of which are so baffling to
 39502	contemporaries, were more clearly and strongly noticeable than among
 39503	others. One instance, which had occurred some twenty years before, was
 39504	a movement among the peasants to emigrate to some unknown âwarm rivers.â
 39505	Hundreds of peasants, among them the BoguchÃ¡rovo folk, suddenly began
 39506	selling their cattle and moving in whole families toward the southeast.
 39507	As birds migrate to somewhere beyond the sea, so these men with their
 39508	wives and children streamed to the southeast, to parts where none of
 39509	them had ever been. They set off in caravans, bought their freedom one
 39510	by one or ran away, and drove or walked toward the âwarm rivers.â Many
 39511	of them were punished, some sent to Siberia, many died of cold and
 39512	hunger on the road, many returned of their own accord, and the movement
 39513	died down of itself just as it had sprung up, without apparent reason.
 39514	But such undercurrents still existed among the people and gathered new
 39515	forces ready to manifest themselves just as strangely, unexpectedly, and
 39516	at the same time simply, naturally, and forcibly. Now in 1812, to anyone
 39517	living in close touch with these people it was apparent that these
 39518	undercurrents were acting strongly and nearing an eruption.
 39519	
 39520	AlpÃ¡tych, who had reached BoguchÃ¡rovo shortly before the old princeâs
 39521	death, noticed an agitation among the peasants, and that contrary to
 39522	what was happening in the Bald Hills district, where over a radius of
 39523	forty miles all the peasants were moving away and leaving their villages
 39524	to be devastated by the Cossacks, the peasants in the steppe region
 39525	round BoguchÃ¡rovo were, it was rumored, in touch with the French,
 39526	received leaflets from them that passed from hand to hand, and did not
 39527	migrate. He learned from domestic serfs loyal to him that the peasant
 39528	Karp, who possessed great influence in the village commune and had
 39529	recently been away driving a government transport, had returned with
 39530	news that the Cossacks were destroying deserted villages, but that the
 39531	French did not harm them. AlpÃ¡tych also knew that on the previous day
 39532	another peasant had even brought from the village of VisloÃºkhovo, which
 39533	was occupied by the French, a proclamation by a French general that no
 39534	harm would be done to the inhabitants, and if they remained they would
 39535	be paid for anything taken from them. As proof of this the peasant had
 39536	brought from VisloÃºkhovo a hundred rubles in notes (he did not know that
 39537	they were false) paid to him in advance for hay.
 39538	
 39539	More important still, AlpÃ¡tych learned that on the morning of the
 39540	very day he gave the village Elder orders to collect carts to move the
 39541	princessâ luggage from BoguchÃ¡rovo, there had been a village meeting at
 39542	which it had been decided not to move but to wait. Yet there was no
 39543	time to waste. On the fifteenth, the day of the old princeâs death,
 39544	the Marshal had insisted on Princess Maryâs leaving at once, as it was
 39545	becoming dangerous. He had told her that after the sixteenth he could
 39546	not be responsible for what might happen. On the evening of the day the
 39547	old prince died the Marshal went away, promising to return next day for
 39548	the funeral. But this he was unable to do, for he received tidings that
 39549	the French had unexpectedly advanced, and had barely time to remove his
 39550	own family and valuables from his estate.
 39551	
 39552	For some thirty years BoguchÃ¡rovo had been managed by the village Elder,
 39553	Dron, whom the old prince called by the diminutive âDrÃ³nushka.â
 39554	
 39555	Dron was one of those physically and mentally vigorous peasants who grow
 39556	big beards as soon as they are of age and go on unchanged till they
 39557	are sixty or seventy, without a gray hair or the loss of a tooth, as
 39558	straight and strong at sixty as at thirty.
 39559	
 39560	Soon after the migration to the âwarm rivers,â in which he had taken
 39561	part like the rest, Dron was made village Elder and overseer of
 39562	BoguchÃ¡rovo, and had since filled that post irreproachably for
 39563	twenty-three years. The peasants feared him more than they did their
 39564	master. The masters, both the old prince and the young, and the steward
 39565	respected him and jestingly called him âthe Minister.â During the
 39566	whole time of his service Dron had never been drunk or ill, never after
 39567	sleepless nights or the hardest tasks had he shown the least fatigue,
 39568	and though he could not read he had never forgotten a single money
 39569	account or the number of quarters of flour in any of the endless
 39570	cartloads he sold for the prince, nor a single shock of the whole corn
 39571	crop on any single acre of the BoguchÃ¡rovo fields.
 39572	
 39573	AlpÃ¡tych, arriving from the devastated Bald Hills estate, sent for his
 39574	Dron on the day of the princeâs funeral and told him to have twelve
 39575	horses got ready for the princessâ carriages and eighteen carts for
 39576	the things to be removed from BoguchÃ¡rovo. Though the peasants paid
 39577	quitrent, AlpÃ¡tych thought no difficulty would be made about complying
 39578	with this order, for there were two hundred and thirty households at
 39579	work in BoguchÃ¡rovo and the peasants were well to do. But on hearing the
 39580	order Dron lowered his eyes and remained silent. AlpÃ¡tych named certain
 39581	peasants he knew, from whom he told him to take the carts.
 39582	
 39583	Dron replied that the horses of these peasants were away carting.
 39584	AlpÃ¡tych named others, but they too, according to Dron, had no horses
 39585	available: some horses were carting for the government, others were too
 39586	weak, and others had died for want of fodder. It seemed that no horses
 39587	could be had even for the carriages, much less for the carting.
 39588	
 39589	AlpÃ¡tych looked intently at Dron and frowned. Just as Dron was a model
 39590	village Elder, so AlpÃ¡tych had not managed the princeâs estates for
 39591	twenty years in vain. He was a model steward, possessing in the highest
 39592	degree the faculty of divining the needs and instincts of those he dealt
 39593	with. Having glanced at Dron he at once understood that his answers did
 39594	not express his personal views but the general mood of the BoguchÃ¡rovo
 39595	commune, by which the Elder had already been carried away. But he also
 39596	knew that Dron, who had acquired property and was hated by the commune,
 39597	must be hesitating between the two camps: the mastersâ and the serfsâ.
 39598	He noticed this hesitation in Dronâs look and therefore frowned and
 39599	moved closer up to him.
 39600	
 39601	âNow just listen, DrÃ³nushka,â said he. âDonât talk nonsense to me. His
 39602	excellency Prince Andrew himself gave me orders to move all the people
 39603	away and not leave them with the enemy, and there is an order from the
 39604	Tsar about it too. Anyone who stays is a traitor to the Tsar. Do you
 39605	hear?â
 39606	
 39607	âI hear,â Dron answered without lifting his eyes.
 39608	
 39609	AlpÃ¡tych was not satisfied with this reply.
 39610	
 39611	âEh, Dron, it will turn out badly!â he said, shaking his head.
 39612	
 39613	âThe power is in your hands,â Dron rejoined sadly.
 39614	
 39615	âEh, Dron, drop it!â AlpÃ¡tych repeated, withdrawing his hand from his
 39616	bosom and solemnly pointing to the floor at Dronâs feet. âI can see
 39617	through you and three yards into the ground under you,â he continued,
 39618	gazing at the floor in front of Dron.
 39619	
 39620	Dron was disconcerted, glanced furtively at AlpÃ¡tych and again lowered
 39621	his eyes.
 39622	
 39623	âYou drop this nonsense and tell the people to get ready to leave their
 39624	homes and go to Moscow and to get carts ready for tomorrow morning
 39625	for the princessâ things. And donât go to any meeting yourself, do you
 39626	hear?â
 39627	
 39628	Dron suddenly fell on his knees.
 39629	
 39630	âYÃ¡kov AlpÃ¡tych, discharge me! Take the keys from me and discharge me,
 39631	for Christâs sake!â
 39632	
 39633	âStop that!â cried AlpÃ¡tych sternly. âI see through you and three yards
 39634	under you,â he repeated, knowing that his skill in beekeeping, his
 39635	knowledge of the right time to sow the oats, and the fact that he had
 39636	been able to retain the old princeâs favor for twenty years had long
 39637	since gained him the reputation of being a wizard, and that the power of
 39638	seeing three yards under a man is considered an attribute of wizards.
 39639	
 39640	Dron got up and was about to say something, but AlpÃ¡tych interrupted
 39641	him.
 39642	
 39643	âWhat is it you have got into your heads, eh?... What are you thinking
 39644	of, eh?â
 39645	
 39646	âWhat am I to do with the people?â said Dron. âTheyâre quite beside
 39647	themselves; I have already told them...â
 39648	
 39649	ââTold them,â I dare say!â said AlpÃ¡tych. âAre they drinking?â he asked
 39650	abruptly.
 39651	
 39652	âQuite beside themselves, YÃ¡kov AlpÃ¡tych; theyâve fetched another
 39653	barrel.â
 39654	
 39655	âWell, then, listen! Iâll go to the police officer, and you tell them
 39656	so, and that they must stop this and the carts must be got ready.â
 39657	
 39658	âI understand.â
 39659	
 39660	AlpÃ¡tych did not insist further. He had managed people for a long time
 39661	and knew that the chief way to make them obey is to show no suspicion
 39662	that they can possibly disobey. Having wrung a submissive âI understandâ
 39663	from Dron, AlpÃ¡tych contented himself with that, though he not only
 39664	doubted but felt almost certain that without the help of troops the
 39665	carts would not be forthcoming.
 39666	
 39667	And so it was, for when evening came no carts had been provided. In the
 39668	village, outside the drink shop, another meeting was being held, which
 39669	decided that the horses should be driven out into the woods and the
 39670	carts should not be provided. Without saying anything of this to the
 39671	princess, AlpÃ¡tych had his own belongings taken out of the carts which
 39672	had arrived from Bald Hills and had those horses got ready for
 39673	the princessâ carriages. Meanwhile he went himself to the police
 39674	authorities.
 39675	
 39676	
 39677	
 39678	
 39679	
 39680	CHAPTER X
 39681	
 39682	After her fatherâs funeral Princess Mary shut herself up in her room and
 39683	did not admit anyone. A maid came to the door to say that AlpÃ¡tych was
 39684	asking for orders about their departure. (This was before his talk with
 39685	Dron.) Princess Mary raised herself on the sofa on which she had been
 39686	lying and replied through the closed door that she did not mean to go
 39687	away and begged to be left in peace.
 39688	
 39689	The windows of the room in which she was lying looked westward. She
 39690	lay on the sofa with her face to the wall, fingering the buttons of the
 39691	leather cushion and seeing nothing but that cushion, and her confused
 39692	thoughts were centered on one subjectâthe irrevocability of death and
 39693	her own spiritual baseness, which she had not suspected, but which had
 39694	shown itself during her fatherâs illness. She wished to pray but did not
 39695	dare to, dared not in her present state of mind address herself to God.
 39696	She lay for a long time in that position.
 39697	
 39698	The sun had reached the other side of the house, and its slanting rays
 39699	shone into the open window, lighting up the room and part of the morocco
 39700	cushion at which Princess Mary was looking. The flow of her thoughts
 39701	suddenly stopped. Unconsciously she sat up, smoothed her hair, got up,
 39702	and went to the window, involuntarily inhaling the freshness of the
 39703	clear but windy evening.
 39704	
 39705	âYes, you can well enjoy the evening now! He is gone and no one will
 39706	hinder you,â she said to herself, and sinking into a chair she let her
 39707	head fall on the window sill.
 39708	
 39709	Someone spoke her name in a soft and tender voice from the garden and
 39710	kissed her head. She looked up. It was Mademoiselle Bourienne in a black
 39711	dress and weepers. She softly approached Princess Mary, sighed, kissed
 39712	her, and immediately began to cry. The princess looked up at her. All
 39713	their former disharmony and her own jealousy recurred to her mind.
 39714	But she remembered too how he had changed of late toward Mademoiselle
 39715	Bourienne and could not bear to see her, thereby showing how unjust were
 39716	the reproaches Princess Mary had mentally addressed to her. âBesides,
 39717	is it for me, for me who desired his death, to condemn anyone?â she
 39718	thought.
 39719	
 39720	Princess Mary vividly pictured to herself the position of Mademoiselle
 39721	Bourienne, whom she had of late kept at a distance, but who yet was
 39722	dependent on her and living in her house. She felt sorry for her
 39723	and held out her hand with a glance of gentle inquiry. Mademoiselle
 39724	Bourienne at once began crying again and kissed that hand, speaking of
 39725	the princessâ sorrow and making herself a partner in it. She said her
 39726	only consolation was the fact that the princess allowed her to share her
 39727	sorrow, that all the old misunderstandings should sink into nothing but
 39728	this great grief; that she felt herself blameless in regard to everyone,
 39729	and that he, from above, saw her affection and gratitude. The princess
 39730	heard her, not heeding her words but occasionally looking up at her and
 39731	listening to the sound of her voice.
 39732	
 39733	âYour position is doubly terrible, dear princess,â said Mademoiselle
 39734	Bourienne after a pause. âI understand that you could not, and cannot,
 39735	think of yourself, but with my love for you I must do so.... Has
 39736	AlpÃ¡tych been to you? Has he spoken to you of going away?â she asked.
 39737	
 39738	Princess Mary did not answer. She did not understand who was to go or
 39739	where to. âIs it possible to plan or think of anything now? Is it not
 39740	all the same?â she thought, and did not reply.
 39741	
 39742	âYou know, chÃ¨re Marie,â said Mademoiselle Bourienne, âthat we are in
 39743	dangerâare surrounded by the French. It would be dangerous to move now.
 39744	If we go we are almost sure to be taken prisoners, and God knows...â
 39745	
 39746	Princess Mary looked at her companion without understanding what she was
 39747	talking about.
 39748	
 39749	âOh, if anyone knew how little anything matters to me now,â she said.
 39750	âOf course I would on no account wish to go away from him.... AlpÃ¡tych
 39751	did say something about going.... Speak to him; I can do nothing,
 39752	nothing, and donât want to....â
 39753	
 39754	âIâve spoken to him. He hopes we should be in time to get away tomorrow,
 39755	but I think it would now be better to stay here,â said Mademoiselle
 39756	Bourienne. âBecause, you will agree, chÃ¨re Marie, to fall into the hands
 39757	of the soldiers or of riotous peasants would be terrible.â
 39758	
 39759	Mademoiselle Bourienne took from her reticule a proclamation (not
 39760	printed on ordinary Russian paper) of General Rameauâs, telling people
 39761	not to leave their homes and that the French authorities would afford
 39762	them proper protection. She handed this to the princess.
 39763	
 39764	âI think it would be best to appeal to that general,â she continued,
 39765	âand I am sure that all due respect would be shown you.â
 39766	
 39767	Princess Mary read the paper, and her face began to quiver with stifled
 39768	sobs.
 39769	
 39770	âFrom whom did you get this?â she asked.
 39771	
 39772	âThey probably recognized that I am French, by my name,â replied
 39773	Mademoiselle Bourienne blushing.
 39774	
 39775	Princess Mary, with the paper in her hand, rose from the window and with
 39776	a pale face went out of the room and into what had been Prince Andrewâs
 39777	study.
 39778	
 39779	âDunyÃ¡sha, send AlpÃ¡tych, or DrÃ³nushka, or somebody to me!â she said,
 39780	âand tell Mademoiselle Bourienne not to come to me,â she added, hearing
 39781	Mademoiselle Bourienneâs voice. âWe must go at once, at once!â she said,
 39782	appalled at the thought of being left in the hands of the French.
 39783	
 39784	âIf Prince Andrew heard that I was in the power of the French! That
 39785	I, the daughter of Prince Nicholas BolkÃ³nski, asked General Rameau for
 39786	protection and accepted his favor!â This idea horrified her, made her
 39787	shudder, blush, and feel such a rush of anger and pride as she had never
 39788	experienced before. All that was distressing, and especially all that
 39789	was humiliating, in her position rose vividly to her mind. âThey, the
 39790	French, would settle in this house: M. le GÃ©nÃ©ral Rameau would occupy
 39791	Prince Andrewâs study and amuse himself by looking through and reading
 39792	his letters and papers. Mademoiselle Bourienne would do the honors of
 39793	BoguchÃ¡rovo for him. I should be given a small room as a favor, the
 39794	soldiers would violate my fatherâs newly dug grave to steal his crosses
 39795	and stars, they would tell me of their victories over the Russians, and
 39796	would pretend to sympathize with my sorrow...â thought Princess Mary,
 39797	not thinking her own thoughts but feeling bound to think like her father
 39798	and her brother. For herself she did not care where she remained or what
 39799	happened to her, but she felt herself the representative of her dead
 39800	father and of Prince Andrew. Involuntarily she thought their thoughts
 39801	and felt their feelings. What they would have said and what they would
 39802	have done she felt bound to say and do. She went into Prince Andrewâs
 39803	study, trying to enter completely into his ideas, and considered her
 39804	position.
 39805	
 39806	The demands of life, which had seemed to her annihilated by her fatherâs
 39807	death, all at once rose before her with a new, previously unknown force
 39808	and took possession of her.
 39809	
 39810	Agitated and flushed she paced the room, sending now for Michael
 39811	IvÃ¡novich and now for TÃ­khon or Dron. DunyÃ¡sha, the nurse, and the other
 39812	maids could not say in how far Mademoiselle Bourienneâs statement was
 39813	correct. AlpÃ¡tych was not at home, he had gone to the police. Neither
 39814	could the architect Michael IvÃ¡novich, who on being sent for came in
 39815	with sleepy eyes, tell Princess Mary anything. With just the same smile
 39816	of agreement with which for fifteen years he had been accustomed to
 39817	answer the old prince without expressing views of his own, he now
 39818	replied to Princess Mary, so that nothing definite could be got from his
 39819	answers. The old valet TÃ­khon, with sunken, emaciated face that bore the
 39820	stamp of inconsolable grief, replied: âYes, Princessâ to all Princess
 39821	Maryâs questions and hardly refrained from sobbing as he looked at her.
 39822	
 39823	At length Dron, the village Elder, entered the room and with a deep bow
 39824	to Princess Mary came to a halt by the doorpost.
 39825	
 39826	Princess Mary walked up and down the room and stopped in front of him.
 39827	
 39828	âDrÃ³nushka,â she said, regarding as a sure friend this DrÃ³nushka who
 39829	always used to bring a special kind of gingerbread from his visit to the
 39830	fair at VyÃ¡zma every year and smilingly offer it to her, âDrÃ³nushka, now
 39831	since our misfortune...â she began, but could not go on.
 39832	
 39833	âWe are all in Godâs hands,â said he, with a sigh.
 39834	
 39835	They were silent for a while.
 39836	
 39837	âDrÃ³nushka, AlpÃ¡tych has gone off somewhere and I have no one to turn
 39838	to. Is it true, as they tell me, that I canât even go away?â
 39839	
 39840	âWhy shouldnât you go away, your excellency? You can go,â said Dron.
 39841	
 39842	âI was told it would be dangerous because of the enemy. Dear friend, I
 39843	can do nothing. I understand nothing. I have nobody! I want to go away
 39844	tonight or early tomorrow morning.â
 39845	
 39846	Dron paused. He looked askance at Princess Mary and said: âThere are no
 39847	horses; I told YÃ¡kov AlpÃ¡tych so.â
 39848	
 39849	âWhy are there none?â asked the princess.
 39850	
 39851	âItâs all Godâs scourge,â said Dron. âWhat horses we had have been
 39852	taken for the army or have diedâthis is such a year! Itâs not a case of
 39853	feeding horsesâwe may die of hunger ourselves! As it is, some go three
 39854	days without eating. Weâve nothing, weâve been ruined.â
 39855	
 39856	Princess Mary listened attentively to what he told her.
 39857	
 39858	âThe peasants are ruined? They have no bread?â she asked.
 39859	
 39860	âTheyâre dying of hunger,â said Dron. âItâs not a case of carting.â
 39861	
 39862	âBut why didnât you tell me, DrÃ³nushka? Isnât it possible to help them?
 39863	Iâll do all I can....â
 39864	
 39865	To Princess Mary it was strange that now, at a moment when such sorrow
 39866	was filling her soul, there could be rich people and poor, and the rich
 39867	could refrain from helping the poor. She had heard vaguely that there
 39868	was such a thing as âlandlordâs cornâ which was sometimes given to the
 39869	peasants. She also knew that neither her father nor her brother would
 39870	refuse to help the peasants in need, she only feared to make some
 39871	mistake in speaking about the distribution of the grain she wished to
 39872	give. She was glad such cares presented themselves, enabling her
 39873	without scruple to forget her own grief. She began asking Dron about the
 39874	peasantsâ needs and what there was in BoguchÃ¡rovo that belonged to the
 39875	landlord.
 39876	
 39877	âBut we have grain belonging to my brother?â she said.
 39878	
 39879	âThe landlordâs grain is all safe,â replied Dron proudly. âOur prince
 39880	did not order it to be sold.â
 39881	
 39882	âGive it to the peasants, let them have all they need; I give you leave
 39883	in my brotherâs name,â said she.
 39884	
 39885	Dron made no answer but sighed deeply.
 39886	
 39887	âGive them that corn if there is enough of it. Distribute it all. I
 39888	give this order in my brotherâs name; and tell them that what is ours is
 39889	theirs. We do not grudge them anything. Tell them so.â
 39890	
 39891	Dron looked intently at the princess while she was speaking.
 39892	
 39893	âDischarge me, little mother, for Godâs sake! Order the keys to be taken
 39894	from me,â said he. âI have served twenty-three years and have done no
 39895	wrong. Discharge me, for Godâs sake!â
 39896	
 39897	Princess Mary did not understand what he wanted of her or why he was
 39898	asking to be discharged. She replied that she had never doubted his
 39899	devotion and that she was ready to do anything for him and for the
 39900	peasants.
 39901	
 39902	
 39903	
 39904	
 39905	
 39906	CHAPTER XI
 39907	
 39908	An hour later DunyÃ¡sha came to tell the princess that Dron had come, and
 39909	all the peasants had assembled at the barn by the princessâ order and
 39910	wished to have word with their mistress.
 39911	
 39912	âBut I never told them to come,â said Princess Mary. âI only told Dron
 39913	to let them have the grain.â
 39914	
 39915	âOnly, for Godâs sake, Princess dear, have them sent away and donât go
 39916	out to them. Itâs all a trick,â said DunyÃ¡sha, âand when YÃ¡kov AlpÃ¡tych
 39917	returns let us get away... and please donât...â
 39918	
 39919	âWhat is a trick?â asked Princess Mary in surprise.
 39920	
 39921	âI know it is, only listen to me for Godâs sake! Ask nurse too. They say
 39922	they donât agree to leave BoguchÃ¡rovo as you ordered.â
 39923	
 39924	âYouâre making some mistake. I never ordered them to go away,â said
 39925	Princess Mary. âCall DrÃ³nushka.â
 39926	
 39927	Dron came and confirmed DunyÃ¡shaâs words; the peasants had come by the
 39928	princessâ order.
 39929	
 39930	âBut I never sent for them,â declared the princess. âYou must have given
 39931	my message wrong. I only said that you were to give them the grain.â
 39932	
 39933	Dron only sighed in reply.
 39934	
 39935	âIf you order it they will go away,â said he.
 39936	
 39937	âNo, no. Iâll go out to them,â said Princess Mary, and in spite of
 39938	the nurseâs and DunyÃ¡shaâs protests she went out into the porch; Dron,
 39939	DunyÃ¡sha, the nurse, and Michael IvÃ¡novich following her.
 39940	
 39941	âThey probably think I am offering them the grain to bribe them to
 39942	remain here, while I myself go away leaving them to the mercy of the
 39943	French,â thought Princess Mary. âI will offer them monthly rations and
 39944	housing at our Moscow estate. I am sure Andrew would do even more in
 39945	my place,â she thought as she went out in the twilight toward the crowd
 39946	standing on the pasture by the barn.
 39947	
 39948	The men crowded closer together, stirred, and rapidly took off their
 39949	hats. Princess Mary lowered her eyes and, tripping over her skirt, came
 39950	close up to them. So many different eyes, old and young, were fixed
 39951	on her, and there were so many different faces, that she could not
 39952	distinguish any of them and, feeling that she must speak to them all
 39953	at once, did not know how to do it. But again the sense that she
 39954	represented her father and her brother gave her courage, and she boldly
 39955	began her speech.
 39956	
 39957	âI am very glad you have come,â she said without raising her eyes, and
 39958	feeling her heart beating quickly and violently. âDrÃ³nushka tells me
 39959	that the war has ruined you. That is our common misfortune, and I
 39960	shall grudge nothing to help you. I am myself going away because it
 39961	is dangerous here... the enemy is near... because... I am giving you
 39962	everything, my friends, and I beg you to take everything, all our grain,
 39963	so that you may not suffer want! And if you have been told that I am
 39964	giving you the grain to keep you hereâthat is not true. On the contrary,
 39965	I ask you to go with all your belongings to our estate near Moscow, and
 39966	I promise you I will see to it that there you shall want for nothing.
 39967	You shall be given food and lodging.â
 39968	
 39969	The princess stopped. Sighs were the only sound heard in the crowd.
 39970	
 39971	âI am not doing this on my own account,â she continued, âI do it in the
 39972	name of my dead father, who was a good master to you, and of my brother
 39973	and his son.â
 39974	
 39975	Again she paused. No one broke the silence.
 39976	
 39977	âOurs is a common misfortune and we will share it together. All that is
 39978	mine is yours,â she concluded, scanning the faces before her.
 39979	
 39980	All eyes were gazing at her with one and the same expression. She
 39981	could not fathom whether it was curiosity, devotion, gratitude, or
 39982	apprehension and distrustâbut the expression on all the faces was
 39983	identical.
 39984	
 39985	âWe are all very thankful for your bounty, but it wonât do for us to
 39986	take the landlordâs grain,â said a voice at the back of the crowd.
 39987	
 39988	âBut why not?â asked the princess.
 39989	
 39990	No one replied and Princess Mary, looking round at the crowd, found that
 39991	every eye she met now was immediately dropped.
 39992	
 39993	âBut why donât you want to take it?â she asked again.
 39994	
 39995	No one answered.
 39996	
 39997	The silence began to oppress the princess and she tried to catch
 39998	someoneâs eye.
 39999	
 40000	âWhy donât you speak?â she inquired of a very old man who stood just
 40001	in front of her leaning on his stick. âIf you think something more is
 40002	wanted, tell me! I will do anything,â said she, catching his eye.
 40003	
 40004	But as if this angered him, he bent his head quite low and muttered:
 40005	
 40006	âWhy should we agree? We donât want the grain.â
 40007	
 40008	âWhy should we give up everything? We donât agree. Donât agree.... We
 40009	are sorry for you, but weâre not willing. Go away yourself, alone...â
 40010	came from various sides of the crowd.
 40011	
 40012	And again all the faces in that crowd bore an identical expression,
 40013	though now it was certainly not an expression of curiosity or gratitude,
 40014	but of angry resolve.
 40015	
 40016	âBut you canât have understood me,â said Princess Mary with a sad smile.
 40017	âWhy donât you want to go? I promise to house and feed you, while here
 40018	the enemy would ruin you....â
 40019	
 40020	But her voice was drowned by the voices of the crowd.
 40021	
 40022	âWeâre not willing. Let them ruin us! We wonât take your grain. We donât
 40023	agree.â
 40024	
 40025	Again Princess Mary tried to catch someoneâs eye, but not a single eye
 40026	in the crowd was turned to her; evidently they were all trying to avoid
 40027	her look. She felt strange and awkward.
 40028	
 40029	âOh yes, an artful tale! Follow her into slavery! Pull down your houses
 40030	and go into bondage! I dare say! âIâll give you grain, indeed!â she
 40031	says,â voices in the crowd were heard saying.
 40032	
 40033	With drooping head Princess Mary left the crowd and went back to the
 40034	house. Having repeated her order to Dron to have horses ready for her
 40035	departure next morning, she went to her room and remained alone with her
 40036	own thoughts.
 40037	
 40038	
 40039	
 40040	
 40041	
 40042	CHAPTER XII
 40043	
 40044	For a long time that night Princess Mary sat by the open window of her
 40045	room hearing the sound of the peasantsâ voices that reached her from
 40046	the village, but it was not of them she was thinking. She felt that she
 40047	could not understand them however much she might think about them. She
 40048	thought only of one thing, her sorrow, which, after the break caused
 40049	by cares for the present, seemed already to belong to the past. Now she
 40050	could remember it and weep or pray.
 40051	
 40052	After sunset the wind had dropped. The night was calm and fresh. Toward
 40053	midnight the voices began to subside, a cock crowed, the full moon began
 40054	to show from behind the lime trees, a fresh white dewy mist began to
 40055	rise, and stillness reigned over the village and the house.
 40056	
 40057	Pictures of the near pastâher fatherâs illness and last momentsârose
 40058	one after another to her memory. With mournful pleasure she now lingered
 40059	over these images, repelling with horror only the last one, the
 40060	picture of his death, which she felt she could not contemplate even in
 40061	imagination at this still and mystic hour of night. And these pictures
 40062	presented themselves to her so clearly and in such detail that they
 40063	seemed now present, now past, and now future.
 40064	
 40065	She vividly recalled the moment when he had his first stroke and was
 40066	being dragged along by his armpits through the garden at Bald Hills,
 40067	muttering something with his helpless tongue, twitching his gray
 40068	eyebrows and looking uneasily and timidly at her.
 40069	
 40070	âEven then he wanted to tell me what he told me the day he died,â she
 40071	thought. âHe had always thought what he said then.â And she recalled in
 40072	all its detail the night at Bald Hills before he had the last stroke,
 40073	when with a foreboding of disaster she had remained at home against his
 40074	will. She had not slept and had stolen downstairs on tiptoe, and going
 40075	to the door of the conservatory where he slept that night had listened
 40076	at the door. In a suffering and weary voice he was saying something to
 40077	TÃ­khon, speaking of the Crimea and its warm nights and of the Empress.
 40078	Evidently he had wanted to talk. âAnd why didnât he call me? Why didnât
 40079	he let me be there instead of TÃ­khon?â Princess Mary had thought and
 40080	thought again now. âNow he will never tell anyone what he had in his
 40081	soul. Never will that moment return for him or for me when he might have
 40082	said all he longed to say, and not TÃ­khon but I might have heard and
 40083	understood him. Why didnât I enter the room?â she thought. âPerhaps he
 40084	would then have said to me what he said the day he died. While talking
 40085	to TÃ­khon he asked about me twice. He wanted to see me, and I was
 40086	standing close by, outside the door. It was sad and painful for him
 40087	to talk to TÃ­khon who did not understand him. I remember how he began
 40088	speaking to him about Lise as if she were aliveâhe had forgotten she
 40089	was deadâand TÃ­khon reminded him that she was no more, and he shouted,
 40090	âFool!â He was greatly depressed. From behind the door I heard how he
 40091	lay down on his bed groaning and loudly exclaimed, âMy God!â Why didnât
 40092	I go in then? What could he have done to me? What could I have lost? And
 40093	perhaps he would then have been comforted and would have said that word
 40094	to me.â And Princess Mary uttered aloud the caressing word he had said
 40095	to her on the day of his death. âDear-est!â she repeated, and began
 40096	sobbing, with tears that relieved her soul. She now saw his face before
 40097	her. And not the face she had known ever since she could remember and
 40098	had always seen at a distance, but the timid, feeble face she had seen
 40099	for the first time quite closely, with all its wrinkles and details,
 40100	when she stooped near to his mouth to catch what he said.
 40101	
 40102	âDear-est!â she repeated again.
 40103	
 40104	âWhat was he thinking when he uttered that word? What is he thinking
 40105	now?â This question suddenly presented itself to her, and in answer she
 40106	saw him before her with the expression that was on his face as he lay
 40107	in his coffin with his chin bound up with a white handkerchief. And the
 40108	horror that had seized her when she touched him and convinced herself
 40109	that that was not he, but something mysterious and horrible, seized her
 40110	again. She tried to think of something else and to pray, but could do
 40111	neither. With wide-open eyes she gazed at the moonlight and the shadows,
 40112	expecting every moment to see his dead face, and she felt that the
 40113	silence brooding over the house and within it held her fast.
 40114	
 40115	âDunyÃ¡sha,â she whispered. âDunyÃ¡sha!â she screamed wildly, and tearing
 40116	herself out of this silence she ran to the servantsâ quarters to meet
 40117	her old nurse and the maidservants who came running toward her.
 40118	
 40119	
 40120	
 40121	
 40122	
 40123	CHAPTER XIII
 40124	
 40125	On the seventeenth of August RostÃ³v and IlyÃ­n, accompanied by LavrÃºshka
 40126	who had just returned from captivity and by an hussar orderly, left
 40127	their quarters at YankÃ³vo, ten miles from BoguchÃ¡rovo, and went for a
 40128	rideâto try a new horse IlyÃ­n had bought and to find out whether there
 40129	was any hay to be had in the villages.
 40130	
 40131	For the last three days BoguchÃ¡rovo had lain between the two hostile
 40132	armies, so that it was as easy for the Russian rearguard to get to it as
 40133	for the French vanguard; RostÃ³v, as a careful squadron commander, wished
 40134	to take such provisions as remained at BoguchÃ¡rovo before the French
 40135	could get them.
 40136	
 40137	RostÃ³v and IlyÃ­n were in the merriest of moods. On the way to
 40138	BoguchÃ¡rovo, a princely estate with a dwelling house and farm where
 40139	they hoped to find many domestic serfs and pretty girls, they questioned
 40140	LavrÃºshka about Napoleon and laughed at his stories, and raced one
 40141	another to try IlyÃ­nâs horse.
 40142	
 40143	RostÃ³v had no idea that the village he was entering was the property of
 40144	that very BolkÃ³nski who had been engaged to his sister.
 40145	
 40146	RostÃ³v and IlyÃ­n gave rein to their horses for a last race along the
 40147	incline before reaching BoguchÃ¡rovo, and RostÃ³v, outstripping IlyÃ­n, was
 40148	the first to gallop into the village street.
 40149	
 40150	âYouâre first!â cried IlyÃ­n, flushed.
 40151	
 40152	âYes, always first both on the grassland and here,â answered RostÃ³v,
 40153	stroking his heated DonÃ©ts horse.
 40154	
 40155	âAnd Iâd have won on my Frenchy, your excellency,â said LavrÃºshka
 40156	from behind, alluding to his shabby cart horse, âonly I didnât wish to
 40157	mortify you.â
 40158	
 40159	They rode at a footpace to the barn, where a large crowd of peasants was
 40160	standing.
 40161	
 40162	Some of the men bared their heads, others stared at the new arrivals
 40163	without doffing their caps. Two tall old peasants with wrinkled faces
 40164	and scanty beards emerged from the tavern, smiling, staggering, and
 40165	singing some incoherent song, and approached the officers.
 40166	
 40167	âFine fellows!â said RostÃ³v laughing. âIs there any hay here?â
 40168	
 40169	âAnd how like one another,â said IlyÃ­n.
 40170	
 40171	âA mo-o-st me-r-r-y co-o-m-pa...!â sang one of the peasants with a
 40172	blissful smile.
 40173	
 40174	One of the men came out of the crowd and went up to RostÃ³v.
 40175	
 40176	âWho do you belong to?â he asked.
 40177	
 40178	âThe French,â replied IlyÃ­n jestingly, âand here is Napoleon
 40179	himselfââand he pointed to LavrÃºshka.
 40180	
 40181	âThen you are Russians?â the peasant asked again.
 40182	
 40183	âAnd is there a large force of you here?â said another, a short man,
 40184	coming up.
 40185	
 40186	âVery large,â answered RostÃ³v. âBut why have you collected here?â he
 40187	added. âIs it a holiday?â
 40188	
 40189	âThe old men have met to talk over the business of the commune,â replied
 40190	the peasant, moving away.
 40191	
 40192	At that moment, on the road leading from the big house, two women and a
 40193	man in a white hat were seen coming toward the officers.
 40194	
 40195	âThe one in pink is mine, so keep off!â said IlyÃ­n on seeing DunyÃ¡sha
 40196	running resolutely toward him.
 40197	
 40198	âSheâll be ours!â said LavrÃºshka to IlyÃ­n, winking.
 40199	
 40200	âWhat do you want, my pretty?â said IlyÃ­n with a smile.
 40201	
 40202	âThe princess ordered me to ask your regiment and your name.â
 40203	
 40204	âThis is Count RostÃ³v, squadron commander, and I am your humble
 40205	servant.â
 40206	
 40207	âCo-o-om-pa-ny!â roared the tipsy peasant with a beatific smile as
 40208	he looked at IlyÃ­n talking to the girl. Following DunyÃ¡sha, AlpÃ¡tych
 40209	advanced to RostÃ³v, having bared his head while still at a distance.
 40210	
 40211	âMay I make bold to trouble your honor?â said he respectfully, but with
 40212	a shade of contempt for the youthfulness of this officer and with a hand
 40213	thrust into his bosom. âMy mistress, daughter of General in Chief Prince
 40214	Nicholas BolkÃ³nski who died on the fifteenth of this month, finding
 40215	herself in difficulties owing to the boorishness of these peopleââhe
 40216	pointed to the peasantsââasks you to come up to the house.... Wonât
 40217	you, please, ride on a little farther,â said AlpÃ¡tych with a melancholy
 40218	smile, âas it is not convenient in the presence of...?â He pointed to
 40219	the two peasants who kept as close to him as horseflies to a horse.
 40220	
 40221	âAh!... AlpÃ¡tych... Ah, YÃ¡kov AlpÃ¡tych... Grand! Forgive us for Christâs
 40222	sake, eh?â said the peasants, smiling joyfully at him.
 40223	
 40224	RostÃ³v looked at the tipsy peasants and smiled.
 40225	
 40226	âOr perhaps they amuse your honor?â remarked AlpÃ¡tych with a staid air,
 40227	as he pointed at the old men with his free hand.
 40228	
 40229	âNo, thereâs not much to be amused at here,â said RostÃ³v, and rode on a
 40230	little way. âWhatâs the matter?â he asked.
 40231	
 40232	âI make bold to inform your honor that the rude peasants here donât
 40233	wish to let the mistress leave the estate, and threaten to unharness her
 40234	horses, so that though everything has been packed up since morning, her
 40235	excellency cannot get away.â
 40236	
 40237	âImpossible!â exclaimed RostÃ³v.
 40238	
 40239	âI have the honor to report to you the actual truth,â said AlpÃ¡tych.
 40240	
 40241	RostÃ³v dismounted, gave his horse to the orderly, and followed AlpÃ¡tych
 40242	to the house, questioning him as to the state of affairs. It appeared
 40243	that the princessâ offer of corn to the peasants the previous day, and
 40244	her talk with Dron and at the meeting, had actually had so bad an effect
 40245	that Dron had finally given up the keys and joined the peasants and had
 40246	not appeared when AlpÃ¡tych sent for him; and that in the morning when
 40247	the princess gave orders to harness for her journey, the peasants had
 40248	come in a large crowd to the barn and sent word that they would not let
 40249	her leave the village: that there was an order not to move, and that
 40250	they would unharness the horses. AlpÃ¡tych had gone out to admonish them,
 40251	but was told (it was chiefly Karp who did the talking, Dron not showing
 40252	himself in the crowd) that they could not let the princess go, that
 40253	there was an order to the contrary, but that if she stayed they would
 40254	serve her as before and obey her in everything.
 40255	
 40256	At the moment when RostÃ³v and IlyÃ­n were galloping along the road,
 40257	Princess Mary, despite the dissuasions of AlpÃ¡tych, her nurse, and the
 40258	maids, had given orders to harness and intended to start, but when the
 40259	cavalrymen were espied they were taken for Frenchmen, the coachman ran
 40260	away, and the women in the house began to wail.
 40261	
 40262	âFather! Benefactor! God has sent you!â exclaimed deeply moved voices as
 40263	RostÃ³v passed through the anteroom.
 40264	
 40265	Princess Mary was sitting helpless and bewildered in the large sitting
 40266	room, when RostÃ³v was shown in. She could not grasp who he was and why
 40267	he had come, or what was happening to her. When she saw his Russian
 40268	face, and by his walk and the first words he uttered recognized him as a
 40269	man of her own class, she glanced at him with her deep radiant look and
 40270	began speaking in a voice that faltered and trembled with emotion. This
 40271	meeting immediately struck RostÃ³v as a romantic event. âA helpless girl
 40272	overwhelmed with grief, left to the mercy of coarse, rioting peasants!
 40273	And what a strange fate sent me here! What gentleness and nobility there
 40274	are in her features and expression!â thought he as he looked at her and
 40275	listened to her timid story.
 40276	
 40277	When she began to tell him that all this had happened the day after her
 40278	fatherâs funeral, her voice trembled. She turned away, and then, as if
 40279	fearing he might take her words as meant to move him to pity, looked at
 40280	him with an apprehensive glance of inquiry. There were tears in RostÃ³vâs
 40281	eyes. Princess Mary noticed this and glanced gratefully at him with that
 40282	radiant look which caused the plainness of her face to be forgotten.
 40283	
 40284	âI cannot express, Princess, how glad I am that I happened to ride here
 40285	and am able to show my readiness to serve you,â said RostÃ³v, rising. âGo
 40286	when you please, and I give you my word of honor that no one shall dare
 40287	to cause you annoyance if only you will allow me to act as your escort.â
 40288	And bowing respectfully, as if to a lady of royal blood, he moved toward
 40289	the door.
 40290	
 40291	RostÃ³vâs deferential tone seemed to indicate that though he would
 40292	consider himself happy to be acquainted with her, he did not wish to
 40293	take advantage of her misfortunes to intrude upon her.
 40294	
 40295	Princess Mary understood this and appreciated his delicacy.
 40296	
 40297	âI am very, very grateful to you,â she said in French, âbut I hope it
 40298	was all a misunderstanding and that no one is to blame for it.â She
 40299	suddenly began to cry.
 40300	
 40301	âExcuse me!â she said.
 40302	
 40303	RostÃ³v, knitting his brows, left the room with another low bow.
 40304	
 40305	
 40306	
 40307	
 40308	
 40309	CHAPTER XIV
 40310	
 40311	âWell, is she pretty? Ah, friendâmy pink one is delicious; her name is
 40312	DunyÃ¡sha....â
 40313	
 40314	But on glancing at RostÃ³vâs face IlyÃ­n stopped short. He saw that his
 40315	hero and commander was following quite a different train of thought.
 40316	
 40317	RostÃ³v glanced angrily at IlyÃ­n and without replying strode off with
 40318	rapid steps to the village.
 40319	
 40320	âIâll show them; Iâll give it to them, the brigands!â said he to
 40321	himself.
 40322	
 40323	AlpÃ¡tych at a gliding trot, only just managing not to run, kept up with
 40324	him with difficulty.
 40325	
 40326	âWhat decision have you been pleased to come to?â said he.
 40327	
 40328	RostÃ³v stopped and, clenching his fists, suddenly and sternly turned on
 40329	AlpÃ¡tych.
 40330	
 40331	âDecision? What decision? Old dotard!...â cried he. âWhat have you been
 40332	about? Eh? The peasants are rioting, and you canât manage them? Youâre
 40333	a traitor yourself! I know you. Iâll flay you all alive!...â And as if
 40334	afraid of wasting his store of anger, he left AlpÃ¡tych and went rapidly
 40335	forward. AlpÃ¡tych, mastering his offended feelings, kept pace with
 40336	RostÃ³v at a gliding gait and continued to impart his views. He said
 40337	the peasants were obdurate and that at the present moment it would be
 40338	imprudent to âoverresistâ them without an armed force, and would it not
 40339	be better first to send for the military?
 40340	
 40341	âIâll give them armed force... Iâll âoverresistâ them!â uttered RostÃ³v
 40342	meaninglessly, breathless with irrational animal fury and the need to
 40343	vent it.
 40344	
 40345	Without considering what he would do he moved unconciously with quick,
 40346	resolute steps toward the crowd. And the nearer he drew to it the more
 40347	AlpÃ¡tych felt that this unreasonable action might produce good results.
 40348	The peasants in the crowd were similarly impressed when they saw
 40349	RostÃ³vâs rapid, firm steps and resolute, frowning face.
 40350	
 40351	After the hussars had come to the village and RostÃ³v had gone to see the
 40352	princess, a certain confusion and dissension had arisen among the crowd.
 40353	Some of the peasants said that these new arrivals were Russians and
 40354	might take it amiss that the mistress was being detained. Dron was of
 40355	this opinion, but as soon as he expressed it Karp and others attacked
 40356	their ex-Elder.
 40357	
 40358	âHow many years have you been fattening on the commune?â Karp shouted at
 40359	him. âItâs all one to you! Youâll dig up your pot of money and take
 40360	it away with you.... What does it matter to you whether our homes are
 40361	ruined or not?â
 40362	
 40363	âWeâve been told to keep order, and that no one is to leave their homes
 40364	or take away a single grain, and thatâs all about it!â cried another.
 40365	
 40366	âIt was your sonâs turn to be conscripted, but no fear! You begrudged
 40367	your lump of a son,â a little old man suddenly began attacking Dronââand
 40368	so they took my VÃ¡nka to be shaved for a soldier! But we all have to
 40369	die.â
 40370	
 40371	âTo be sure, we all have to die. Iâm not against the commune,â said
 40372	Dron.
 40373	
 40374	âThatâs itânot against it! Youâve filled your belly....â
 40375	
 40376	The two tall peasants had their say. As soon as RostÃ³v, followed by
 40377	IlyÃ­n, LavrÃºshka, and AlpÃ¡tych, came up to the crowd, Karp, thrusting
 40378	his fingers into his belt and smiling a little, walked to the front.
 40379	Dron on the contrary retired to the rear and the crowd drew closer
 40380	together.
 40381	
 40382	âWho is your Elder here? Hey?â shouted RostÃ³v, coming up to the crowd
 40383	with quick steps.
 40384	
 40385	âThe Elder? What do you want with him?...â asked Karp.
 40386	
 40387	But before the words were well out of his mouth, his cap flew off and a
 40388	fierce blow jerked his head to one side.
 40389	
 40390	âCaps off, traitors!â shouted RostÃ³v in a wrathful voice. âWhereâs the
 40391	Elder?â he cried furiously.
 40392	
 40393	âThe Elder.... He wants the Elder!... Dron ZakhÃ¡rych, you!â meek and
 40394	flustered voices here and there were heard calling and caps began to
 40395	come off their heads.
 40396	
 40397	âWe donât riot, weâre following the orders,â declared Karp, and at that
 40398	moment several voices began speaking together.
 40399	
 40400	âItâs as the old men have decidedâthereâs too many of you giving
 40401	orders.â
 40402	
 40403	âArguing? Mutiny!... Brigands! Traitors!â cried RostÃ³v unmeaningly in a
 40404	voice not his own, gripping Karp by the collar. âBind him, bind him!â he
 40405	shouted, though there was no one to bind him but LavrÃºshka and AlpÃ¡tych.
 40406	
 40407	LavrÃºshka, however, ran up to Karp and seized him by the arms from
 40408	behind.
 40409	
 40410	âShall I call up our men from beyond the hill?â he called out.
 40411	
 40412	AlpÃ¡tych turned to the peasants and ordered two of them by name to come
 40413	and bind Karp. The men obediently came out of the crowd and began taking
 40414	off their belts.
 40415	
 40416	âWhereâs the Elder?â demanded RostÃ³v in a loud voice.
 40417	
 40418	With a pale and frowning face Dron stepped out of the crowd.
 40419	
 40420	âAre you the Elder? Bind him, LavrÃºshka!â shouted RostÃ³v, as if that
 40421	order, too, could not possibly meet with any opposition.
 40422	
 40423	And in fact two more peasants began binding Dron, who took off his own
 40424	belt and handed it to them, as if to aid them.
 40425	
 40426	âAnd you all listen to me!â said RostÃ³v to the peasants. âBe off to your
 40427	houses at once, and donât let one of your voices be heard!â
 40428	
 40429	âWhy, weâve not done any harm! We did it just out of foolishness. Itâs
 40430	all nonsense.... I said then that it was not in order,â voices were
 40431	heard bickering with one another.
 40432	
 40433	âThere! What did I say?â said AlpÃ¡tych, coming into his own again. âItâs
 40434	wrong, lads!â
 40435	
 40436	âAll our stupidity, YÃ¡kov AlpÃ¡tych,â came the answers, and the crowd
 40437	began at once to disperse through the village.
 40438	
 40439	The two bound men were led off to the masterâs house. The two drunken
 40440	peasants followed them.
 40441	
 40442	âAye, when I look at you!...â said one of them to Karp.
 40443	
 40444	âHow can one talk to the masters like that? What were you thinking of,
 40445	you fool?â added the otherââA real fool!â
 40446	
 40447	Two hours later the carts were standing in the courtyard of the
 40448	BoguchÃ¡rovo house. The peasants were briskly carrying out the
 40449	proprietorâs goods and packing them on the carts, and Dron, liberated at
 40450	Princess Maryâs wish from the cupboard where he had been confined, was
 40451	standing in the yard directing the men.
 40452	
 40453	âDonât put it in so carelessly,â said one of the peasants, a man with a
 40454	round smiling face, taking a casket from a housemaid. âYou know it has
 40455	cost money! How can you chuck it in like that or shove it under the cord
 40456	where itâll get rubbed? I donât like that way of doing things. Let it
 40457	all be done properly, according to rule. Look here, put it under the
 40458	bast matting and cover it with hayâthatâs the way!â
 40459	
 40460	âEh, books, books!â said another peasant, bringing out Prince Andrewâs
 40461	library cupboards. âDonât catch up against it! Itâs heavy, ladsâsolid
 40462	books.â
 40463	
 40464	âYes, they worked all day and didnât play!â remarked the tall,
 40465	round-faced peasant gravely, pointing with a significant wink at the
 40466	dictionaries that were on the top.
 40467	
 40468	
 40469	Unwilling to obtrude himself on the princess, RostÃ³v did not go back to
 40470	the house but remained in the village awaiting her departure. When her
 40471	carriage drove out of the house, he mounted and accompanied her eight
 40472	miles from BoguchÃ¡rovo to where the road was occupied by our troops. At
 40473	the inn at YankÃ³vo he respectfully took leave of her, for the first time
 40474	permitting himself to kiss her hand.
 40475	
 40476	âHow can you speak so!â he blushingly replied to Princess Maryâs
 40477	expressions of gratitude for her deliverance, as she termed what had
 40478	occurred. âAny police officer would have done as much! If we had had
 40479	only peasants to fight, we should not have let the enemy come so far,â
 40480	said he with a sense of shame and wishing to change the subject. âI
 40481	am only happy to have had the opportunity of making your acquaintance.
 40482	Good-by, Princess. I wish you happiness and consolation and hope to meet
 40483	you again in happier circumstances. If you donât want to make me blush,
 40484	please donât thank me!â
 40485	
 40486	But the princess, if she did not again thank him in words, thanked
 40487	him with the whole expression of her face, radiant with gratitude and
 40488	tenderness. She could not believe that there was nothing to thank him
 40489	for. On the contrary, it seemed to her certain that had he not been
 40490	there she would have perished at the hands of the mutineers and of the
 40491	French, and that he had exposed himself to terrible and obvious danger
 40492	to save her, and even more certain was it that he was a man of lofty and
 40493	noble soul, able to understand her position and her sorrow. His kind,
 40494	honest eyes, with the tears rising in them when she herself had begun to
 40495	cry as she spoke of her loss, did not leave her memory.
 40496	
 40497	When she had taken leave of him and remained alone she suddenly felt
 40498	her eyes filling with tears, and then not for the first time the strange
 40499	question presented itself to her: did she love him?
 40500	
 40501	On the rest of the way to Moscow, though the princessâ position was not
 40502	a cheerful one, DunyÃ¡sha, who went with her in the carriage, more than
 40503	once noticed that her mistress leaned out of the window and smiled at
 40504	something with an expression of mingled joy and sorrow.
 40505	
 40506	âWell, supposing I do love him?â thought Princess Mary.
 40507	
 40508	Ashamed as she was of acknowledging to herself that she had fallen in
 40509	love with a man who would perhaps never love her, she comforted herself
 40510	with the thought that no one would ever know it and that she would not
 40511	be to blame if, without ever speaking of it to anyone, she continued to
 40512	the end of her life to love the man with whom she had fallen in love for
 40513	the first and last time in her life.
 40514	
 40515	Sometimes when she recalled his looks, his sympathy, and his words,
 40516	happiness did not appear impossible to her. It was at those moments that
 40517	DunyÃ¡sha noticed her smiling as she looked out of the carriage window.
 40518	
 40519	âWas it not fate that brought him to BoguchÃ¡rovo, and at that very
 40520	moment?â thought Princess Mary. âAnd that caused his sister to refuse my
 40521	brother?â And in all this Princess Mary saw the hand of Providence.
 40522	
 40523	The impression the princess made on RostÃ³v was a very agreeable one. To
 40524	remember her gave him pleasure, and when his comrades, hearing of his
 40525	adventure at BoguchÃ¡rovo, rallied him on having gone to look for hay
 40526	and having picked up one of the wealthiest heiresses in Russia, he grew
 40527	angry. It made him angry just because the idea of marrying the gentle
 40528	Princess Mary, who was attractive to him and had an enormous fortune,
 40529	had against his will more than once entered his head. For himself
 40530	personally Nicholas could not wish for a better wife: by marrying her
 40531	he would make the countess his mother happy, would be able to put his
 40532	fatherâs affairs in order, and would evenâhe felt itâensure Princess
 40533	Maryâs happiness.
 40534	
 40535	But SÃ³nya? And his plighted word? That was why RostÃ³v grew angry when he
 40536	was rallied about Princess BolkÃ³nskaya.
 40537	
 40538	
 40539	
 40540	
 40541	
 40542	CHAPTER XV
 40543	
 40544	On receiving command of the armies KutÃºzov remembered Prince Andrew and
 40545	sent an order for him to report at headquarters.
 40546	
 40547	Prince Andrew arrived at TsÃ¡revo-ZaymÃ­shche on the very day and at the
 40548	very hour that KutÃºzov was reviewing the troops for the first time. He
 40549	stopped in the village at the priestâs house in front of which stood the
 40550	commander in chiefâs carriage, and he sat down on the bench at the gate
 40551	awaiting his Serene Highness, as everyone now called KutÃºzov. From the
 40552	field beyond the village came now sounds of regimental music and now the
 40553	roar of many voices shouting âHurrah!â to the new commander in chief.
 40554	Two orderlies, a courier and a major-domo, stood near by, some ten paces
 40555	from Prince Andrew, availing themselves of KutÃºzovâs absence and of the
 40556	fine weather. A short, swarthy lieutenant colonel of hussars with thick
 40557	mustaches and whiskers rode up to the gate and, glancing at Prince
 40558	Andrew, inquired whether his Serene Highness was putting up there and
 40559	whether he would soon be back.
 40560	
 40561	Prince Andrew replied that he was not on his Serene Highnessâ staff
 40562	but was himself a new arrival. The lieutenant colonel turned to a smart
 40563	orderly, who, with the peculiar contempt with which a commander in
 40564	chiefâs orderly speaks to officers, replied:
 40565	
 40566	âWhat? His Serene Highness? I expect heâll be here soon. What do you
 40567	want?â
 40568	
 40569	The lieutenant colonel of hussars smiled beneath his mustache at the
 40570	orderlyâs tone, dismounted, gave his horse to a dispatch runner, and
 40571	approached BolkÃ³nski with a slight bow. BolkÃ³nski made room for him on
 40572	the bench and the lieutenant colonel sat down beside him.
 40573	
 40574	âYouâre also waiting for the commander in chief?â said he. âThey say he
 40575	weceives evewyone, thank God!... Itâs awful with those sausage eaters!
 40576	ErmÃ³lov had weason to ask to be pwomoted to be a German! Now pâwaps
 40577	Wussians will get a look in. As it was, devil only knows what was
 40578	happening. We kept wetweating and wetweating. Did you take part in the
 40579	campaign?â he asked.
 40580	
 40581	âI had the pleasure,â replied Prince Andrew, ânot only of taking part in
 40582	the retreat but of losing in that retreat all I held dearânot to mention
 40583	the estate and home of my birthâmy father, who died of grief. I belong
 40584	to the province of SmolÃ©nsk.â
 40585	
 40586	âAh? Youâre Pwince BolkÃ³nski? Vewy glad to make your acquaintance! Iâm
 40587	Lieutenant Colonel DenÃ­sov, better known as âVÃ¡ska,ââ said DenÃ­sov,
 40588	pressing Prince Andrewâs hand and looking into his face with a
 40589	particularly kindly attention. âYes, I heard,â said he sympathetically,
 40590	and after a short pause added: âYes, itâs Scythian warfare. Itâs all
 40591	vewy wellâonly not for those who get it in the neck. So you are Pwince
 40592	Andwew BolkÃ³nski?â He swayed his head. âVewy pleased, Pwince, to make
 40593	your acquaintance!â he repeated again, smiling sadly, and he again
 40594	pressed Prince Andrewâs hand.
 40595	
 40596	Prince Andrew knew DenÃ­sov from what NatÃ¡sha had told him of her first
 40597	suitor. This memory carried him sadly and sweetly back to those painful
 40598	feelings of which he had not thought lately, but which still found
 40599	place in his soul. Of late he had received so many new and very serious
 40600	impressionsâsuch as the retreat from SmolÃ©nsk, his visit to Bald Hills,
 40601	and the recent news of his fatherâs deathâand had experienced so many
 40602	emotions, that for a long time past those memories had not entered his
 40603	mind, and now that they did, they did not act on him with nearly their
 40604	former strength. For DenÃ­sov, too, the memories awakened by the name of
 40605	BolkÃ³nski belonged to a distant, romantic past, when after supper and
 40606	after NatÃ¡shaâs singing he had proposed to a little girl of fifteen
 40607	without realizing what he was doing. He smiled at the recollection of
 40608	that time and of his love for NatÃ¡sha, and passed at once to what now
 40609	interested him passionately and exclusively. This was a plan of campaign
 40610	he had devised while serving at the outposts during the retreat. He had
 40611	proposed that plan to Barclay de Tolly and now wished to propose it
 40612	to KutÃºzov. The plan was based on the fact that the French line
 40613	of operation was too extended, and it proposed that instead of, or
 40614	concurrently with, action on the front to bar the advance of the French,
 40615	we should attack their line of communication. He began explaining his
 40616	plan to Prince Andrew.
 40617	
 40618	âThey canât hold all that line. Itâs impossible. I will undertake to
 40619	bweak thwough. Give me five hundwed men and I will bweak the line,
 40620	thatâs certain! Thereâs only one wayâguewilla warfare!â
 40621	
 40622	DenÃ­sov rose and began gesticulating as he explained his plan to
 40623	BolkÃ³nski. In the midst of his explanation shouts were heard from the
 40624	army, growing more incoherent and more diffused, mingling with music
 40625	and songs and coming from the field where the review was held. Sounds of
 40626	hoofs and shouts were nearing the village.
 40627	
 40628	âHeâs coming! Heâs coming!â shouted a Cossack standing at the gate.
 40629	
 40630	BolkÃ³nski and DenÃ­sov moved to the gate, at which a knot of soldiers
 40631	(a guard of honor) was standing, and they saw KutÃºzov coming down the
 40632	street mounted on a rather small sorrel horse. A huge suite of generals
 40633	rode behind him. Barclay was riding almost beside him, and a crowd of
 40634	officers ran after and around them shouting, âHurrah!â
 40635	
 40636	His adjutants galloped into the yard before him. KutÃºzov was impatiently
 40637	urging on his horse, which ambled smoothly under his weight, and he
 40638	raised his hand to his white Horse Guardâs cap with a red band and no
 40639	peak, nodding his head continually. When he came up to the guard of
 40640	honor, a fine set of Grenadiers mostly wearing decorations, who were
 40641	giving him the salute, he looked at them silently and attentively for
 40642	nearly a minute with the steady gaze of a commander and then turned to
 40643	the crowd of generals and officers surrounding him. Suddenly his face
 40644	assumed a subtle expression, he shrugged his shoulders with an air of
 40645	perplexity.
 40646	
 40647	âAnd with such fine fellows to retreat and retreat! Well, good-by,
 40648	General,â he added, and rode into the yard past Prince Andrew and
 40649	DenÃ­sov.
 40650	
 40651	âHurrah! hurrah! hurrah!â shouted those behind him.
 40652	
 40653	Since Prince Andrew had last seen him KutÃºzov had grown still more
 40654	corpulent, flaccid, and fat. But the bleached eyeball, the scar, and the
 40655	familiar weariness of his expression were still the same. He was wearing
 40656	the white Horse Guardâs cap and a military overcoat with a whip hanging
 40657	over his shoulder by a thin strap. He sat heavily and swayed limply on
 40658	his brisk little horse.
 40659	
 40660	âWhew... whew... whew!â he whistled just audibly as he rode into the
 40661	yard. His face expressed the relief of relaxed strain felt by a man who
 40662	means to rest after a ceremony. He drew his left foot out of the stirrup
 40663	and, lurching with his whole body and puckering his face with the
 40664	effort, raised it with difficulty onto the saddle, leaned on his knee,
 40665	groaned, and slipped down into the arms of the Cossacks and adjutants
 40666	who stood ready to assist him.
 40667	
 40668	He pulled himself together, looked round, screwing up his eyes, glanced
 40669	at Prince Andrew, and, evidently not recognizing him, moved with his
 40670	waddling gait to the porch. âWhew... whew... whew!â he whistled, and
 40671	again glanced at Prince Andrew. As often occurs with old men, it was
 40672	only after some seconds that the impression produced by Prince Andrewâs
 40673	face linked itself up with KutÃºzovâs remembrance of his personality.
 40674	
 40675	âAh, how do you do, my dear prince? How do you do, my dear boy? Come
 40676	along...â said he, glancing wearily round, and he stepped onto the porch
 40677	which creaked under his weight.
 40678	
 40679	He unbuttoned his coat and sat down on a bench in the porch.
 40680	
 40681	âAnd howâs your father?â
 40682	
 40683	âI received news of his death, yesterday,â replied Prince Andrew
 40684	abruptly.
 40685	
 40686	KutÃºzov looked at him with eyes wide open with dismay and then took off
 40687	his cap and crossed himself:
 40688	
 40689	âMay the kingdom of Heaven be his! Godâs will be done to us all!â He
 40690	sighed deeply, his whole chest heaving, and was silent for a while. âI
 40691	loved him and respected him, and sympathize with you with all my heart.â
 40692	
 40693	He embraced Prince Andrew, pressing him to his fat breast, and for some
 40694	time did not let him go. When he released him Prince Andrew saw that
 40695	KutÃºzovâs flabby lips were trembling and that tears were in his eyes. He
 40696	sighed and pressed on the bench with both hands to raise himself.
 40697	
 40698	âCome! Come with me, weâll have a talk,â said he.
 40699	
 40700	But at that moment DenÃ­sov, no more intimidated by his superiors than by
 40701	the enemy, came with jingling spurs up the steps of the porch, despite
 40702	the angry whispers of the adjutants who tried to stop him. KutÃºzov, his
 40703	hands still pressed on the seat, glanced at him glumly. DenÃ­sov, having
 40704	given his name, announced that he had to communicate to his Serene
 40705	Highness a matter of great importance for their countryâs welfare.
 40706	KutÃºzov looked wearily at him and, lifting his hands with a gesture of
 40707	annoyance, folded them across his stomach, repeating the words: âFor our
 40708	countryâs welfare? Well, what is it? Speak!â DenÃ­sov blushed like a
 40709	girl (it was strange to see the color rise in that shaggy, bibulous,
 40710	time-worn face) and boldly began to expound his plan of cutting the
 40711	enemyâs lines of communication between SmolÃ©nsk and VyÃ¡zma. DenÃ­sov came
 40712	from those parts and knew the country well. His plan seemed decidedly
 40713	a good one, especially from the strength of conviction with which he
 40714	spoke. KutÃºzov looked down at his own legs, occasionally glancing at the
 40715	door of the adjoining hut as if expecting something unpleasant to emerge
 40716	from it. And from that hut, while DenÃ­sov was speaking, a general with a
 40717	portfolio under his arm really did appear.
 40718	
 40719	âWhat?â said KutÃºzov, in the midst of DenÃ­sovâs explanations, âare you
 40720	ready so soon?â
 40721	
 40722	âReady, your Serene Highness,â replied the general.
 40723	
 40724	KutÃºzov swayed his head, as much as to say: âHow is one man to deal with
 40725	it all?â and again listened to DenÃ­sov.
 40726	
 40727	âI give my word of honor as a Wussian officer,â said DenÃ­sov, âthat I
 40728	can bweak Napoleonâs line of communication!â
 40729	
 40730	âWhat relation are you to Intendant General KirÃ­l AndrÃ©evich DenÃ­sov?â
 40731	asked KutÃºzov, interrupting him.
 40732	
 40733	âHe is my uncle, your Sewene Highness.â
 40734	
 40735	âAh, we were friends,â said KutÃºzov cheerfully. âAll right, all right,
 40736	friend, stay here at the staff and tomorrow weâll have a talk.â
 40737	
 40738	With a nod to DenÃ­sov he turned away and put out his hand for the papers
 40739	KonovnÃ­tsyn had brought him.
 40740	
 40741	âWould not your Serene Highness like to come inside?â said the general
 40742	on duty in a discontented voice, âthe plans must be examined and several
 40743	papers have to be signed.â
 40744	
 40745	An adjutant came out and announced that everything was in readiness
 40746	within. But KutÃºzov evidently did not wish to enter that room till he
 40747	was disengaged. He made a grimace....
 40748	
 40749	âNo, tell them to bring a small table out here, my dear boy. Iâll look
 40750	at them here,â said he. âDonât go away,â he added, turning to Prince
 40751	Andrew, who remained in the porch and listened to the generalâs report.
 40752	
 40753	While this was being given, Prince Andrew heard the whisper of a womanâs
 40754	voice and the rustle of a silk dress behind the door. Several times on
 40755	glancing that way he noticed behind that door a plump, rosy, handsome
 40756	woman in a pink dress with a lilac silk kerchief on her head, holding
 40757	a dish and evidently awaiting the entrance of the commander in chief.
 40758	KutÃºzovâs adjutant whispered to Prince Andrew that this was the wife of
 40759	the priest whose home it was, and that she intended to offer his Serene
 40760	Highness bread and salt. âHer husband has welcomed his Serene Highness
 40761	with the cross at the church, and she intends to welcome him in the
 40762	house.... Sheâs very pretty,â added the adjutant with a smile. At
 40763	those words KutÃºzov looked round. He was listening to the generalâs
 40764	reportâwhich consisted chiefly of a criticism of the position at
 40765	TsÃ¡revo-ZaymÃ­shcheâas he had listened to DenÃ­sov, and seven years
 40766	previously had listened to the discussion at the Austerlitz council of
 40767	war. He evidently listened only because he had ears which, though there
 40768	was a piece of tow in one of them, could not help hearing; but it
 40769	was evident that nothing the general could say would surprise or even
 40770	interest him, that he knew all that would be said beforehand, and heard
 40771	it all only because he had to, as one has to listen to the chanting of
 40772	a service of prayer. All that DenÃ­sov had said was clever and to the
 40773	point. What the general was saying was even more clever and to
 40774	the point, but it was evident that KutÃºzov despised knowledge
 40775	and cleverness, and knew of something else that would decide the
 40776	matterâsomething independent of cleverness and knowledge. Prince
 40777	Andrew watched the commander in chiefâs face attentively, and the only
 40778	expression he could see there was one of boredom, curiosity as to the
 40779	meaning of the feminine whispering behind the door, and a desire to
 40780	observe propriety. It was evident that KutÃºzov despised cleverness and
 40781	learning and even the patriotic feeling shown by DenÃ­sov, but despised
 40782	them not because of his own intellect, feelings, or knowledgeâhe did not
 40783	try to display any of theseâbut because of something else. He despised
 40784	them because of his old age and experience of life. The only instruction
 40785	KutÃºzov gave of his own accord during that report referred to looting by
 40786	the Russian troops. At the end of the report the general put before
 40787	him for signature a paper relating to the recovery of payment from army
 40788	commanders for green oats mown down by the soldiers, when landowners
 40789	lodged petitions for compensation.
 40790	
 40791	After hearing the matter, KutÃºzov smacked his lips together and shook
 40792	his head.
 40793	
 40794	âInto the stove... into the fire with it! I tell you once for all, my
 40795	dear fellow,â said he, âinto the fire with all such things! Let them cut
 40796	the crops and burn wood to their heartsâ content. I donât order it
 40797	or allow it, but I donât exact compensation either. One canât get on
 40798	without it. âWhen wood is chopped the chips will fly.ââ He looked at the
 40799	paper again. âOh, this German precision!â he muttered, shaking his head.
 40800	
 40801

 40803	
 40804	
 40805	CHAPTER XVI
 40806	
 40807	âWell, thatâs all!â said KutÃºzov as he signed the last of the documents,
 40808	and rising heavily and smoothing out the folds in his fat white neck he
 40809	moved toward the door with a more cheerful expression.
 40810	
 40811	The priestâs wife, flushing rosy red, caught up the dish she had after
 40812	all not managed to present at the right moment, though she had so long
 40813	been preparing for it, and with a low bow offered it to KutÃºzov.
 40814	
 40815	He screwed up his eyes, smiled, lifted her chin with his hand, and said:
 40816	
 40817	âAh, what a beauty! Thank you, sweetheart!â
 40818	
 40819	He took some gold pieces from his trouser pocket and put them on the
 40820	dish for her. âWell, my dear, and how are we getting on?â he asked,
 40821	moving to the door of the room assigned to him. The priestâs wife
 40822	smiled, and with dimples in her rosy cheeks followed him into the room.
 40823	The adjutant came out to the porch and asked Prince Andrew to lunch with
 40824	him. Half an hour later Prince Andrew was again called to KutÃºzov.
 40825	He found him reclining in an armchair, still in the same unbuttoned
 40826	overcoat. He had in his hand a French book which he closed as Prince
 40827	Andrew entered, marking the place with a knife. Prince Andrew saw by the
 40828	cover that it was Les Chevaliers du Cygne by Madame de Genlis.
 40829	
 40830	âWell, sit down, sit down here. Letâs have a talk,â said KutÃºzov. âItâs
 40831	sad, very sad. But remember, my dear fellow, that I am a father to you,
 40832	a second father....â
 40833	
 40834	Prince Andrew told KutÃºzov all he knew of his fatherâs death, and what
 40835	he had seen at Bald Hills when he passed through it.
 40836	
 40837	âWhat... what they have brought us to!â KutÃºzov suddenly cried in an
 40838	agitated voice, evidently picturing vividly to himself from Prince
 40839	Andrewâs story the condition Russia was in. âBut give me time, give me
 40840	time!â he said with a grim look, evidently not wishing to continue this
 40841	agitating conversation, and added: âI sent for you to keep you with me.â
 40842	
 40843	âI thank your Serene Highness, but I fear I am no longer fit for the
 40844	staff,â replied Prince Andrew with a smile which KutÃºzov noticed.
 40845	
 40846	KutÃºzov glanced inquiringly at him.
 40847	
 40848	âBut above all,â added Prince Andrew, âI have grown used to my regiment,
 40849	am fond of the officers, and I fancy the men also like me. I should be
 40850	sorry to leave the regiment. If I decline the honor of being with you,
 40851	believe me...â
 40852	
 40853	A shrewd, kindly, yet subtly derisive expression lit up KutÃºzovâs podgy
 40854	face. He cut BolkÃ³nski short.
 40855	
 40856	âI am sorry, for I need you. But youâre right, youâre right! Itâs not
 40857	here that men are needed. Advisers are always plentiful, but men are
 40858	not. The regiments would not be what they are if the would-be advisers
 40859	served there as you do. I remember you at Austerlitz.... I remember,
 40860	yes, I remember you with the standard!â said KutÃºzov, and a flush of
 40861	pleasure suffused Prince Andrewâs face at this recollection.
 40862	
 40863	Taking his hand and drawing him downwards, KutÃºzov offered his cheek to
 40864	be kissed, and again Prince Andrew noticed tears in the old manâs eyes.
 40865	Though Prince Andrew knew that KutÃºzovâs tears came easily, and that he
 40866	was particularly tender to and considerate of him from a wish to
 40867	show sympathy with his loss, yet this reminder of Austerlitz was both
 40868	pleasant and flattering to him.
 40869	
 40870	âGo your way and God be with you. I know your path is the path of
 40871	honor!â He paused. âI missed you at Bucharest, but I needed someone to
 40872	send.â And changing the subject, KutÃºzov began to speak of the Turkish
 40873	war and the peace that had been concluded. âYes, I have been much
 40874	blamed,â he said, âboth for that war and the peace... but everything
 40875	came at the right time. Tout vient Ã  point Ã  celui qui sait attendre. *
 40876	And there were as many advisers there as here...â he went on, returning
 40877	to the subject of âadvisersâ which evidently occupied him. âAh, those
 40878	advisers!â said he. âIf we had listened to them all we should not have
 40879	made peace with Turkey and should not have been through with that war.
 40880	Everything in haste, but more haste, less speed. KÃ¡menski would have
 40881	been lost if he had not died. He stormed fortresses with thirty thousand
 40882	men. It is not difficult to capture a fortress but it is difficult to
 40883	win a campaign. For that, not storming and attacking but patience and
 40884	time are wanted. KÃ¡menski sent soldiers to Rustchuk, but I only employed
 40885	these two things and took more fortresses than KÃ¡menski and made them
 40886	Turks eat horseflesh!â He swayed his head. âAnd the French shall too,
 40887	believe me,â he went on, growing warmer and beating his chest, âIâll
 40888	make them eat horseflesh!â And tears again dimmed his eyes.
 40889	
 40890	    * âEverything comes in time to him who knows how to wait.â
 40891	
 40892	
 40893	âBut shanât we have to accept battle?â remarked Prince Andrew.
 40894	
 40895	âWe shall if everybody wants it; it canât be helped.... But believe
 40896	me, my dear boy, there is nothing stronger than those two: patience and
 40897	time, they will do it all. But the advisers nâentendent pas de cette
 40898	oreille, voilÃ  le mal. * Some want a thingâothers donât. Whatâs one to
 40899	do?â he asked, evidently expecting an answer. âWell, what do you want
 40900	us to do?â he repeated and his eye shone with a deep, shrewd look.
 40901	âIâll tell you what to do,â he continued, as Prince Andrew still did not
 40902	reply: âI will tell you what to do, and what I do. Dans le doute, mon
 40903	cher,â he paused, âabstiens-toiâ *(2)âhe articulated the French proverb
 40904	deliberately.
 40905	
 40906	     * âDonât see it that way, thatâs the trouble.â
 40907	
 40908	     * (2) âWhen in doubt, my dear fellow, do nothing.â
 40909	
 40910	
 40911	âWell, good-by, my dear fellow; remember that with all my heart I share
 40912	your sorrow, and that for you I am not a Serene Highness, nor a prince,
 40913	nor a commander in chief, but a father! If you want anything come
 40914	straight to me. Good-by, my dear boy.â
 40915	
 40916	Again he embraced and kissed Prince Andrew, but before the latter
 40917	had left the room KutÃºzov gave a sigh of relief and went on with his
 40918	unfinished novel, Les Chevaliers du Cygne by Madame de Genlis.
 40919	
 40920	Prince Andrew could not have explained how or why it was, but after that
 40921	interview with KutÃºzov he went back to his regiment reassured as to
 40922	the general course of affairs and as to the man to whom it had been
 40923	entrusted. The more he realized the absence of all personal motive in
 40924	that old manâin whom there seemed to remain only the habit of passions,
 40925	and in place of an intellect (grouping events and drawing conclusions)
 40926	only the capacity calmly to contemplate the course of eventsâthe more
 40927	reassured he was that everything would be as it should. âHe will not
 40928	bring in any plan of his own. He will not devise or undertake
 40929	anything,â thought Prince Andrew, âbut he will hear everything, remember
 40930	everything, and put everything in its place. He will not hinder
 40931	anything useful nor allow anything harmful. He understands that there is
 40932	something stronger and more important than his own willâthe inevitable
 40933	course of events, and he can see them and grasp their significance,
 40934	and seeing that significance can refrain from meddling and renounce his
 40935	personal wish directed to something else. And above all,â thought Prince
 40936	Andrew, âone believes in him because heâs Russian, despite the novel
 40937	by Genlis and the French proverbs, and because his voice shook when he
 40938	said: âWhat they have brought us to!â and had a sob in it when he said
 40939	he would âmake them eat horseflesh!ââ
 40940	
 40941	On such feelings, more or less dimly shared by all, the unanimity and
 40942	general approval were founded with which, despite court influences, the
 40943	popular choice of KutÃºzov as commander in chief was received.
 40944	
 40945	
 40946	
 40947	
 40948	
 40949	CHAPTER XVII
 40950	
 40951	After the Emperor had left Moscow, life flowed on there in its usual
 40952	course, and its course was so very usual that it was difficult to
 40953	remember the recent days of patriotic elation and ardor, hard to believe
 40954	that Russia was really in danger and that the members of the English
 40955	Club were also sons of the Fatherland ready to sacrifice everything
 40956	for it. The one thing that recalled the patriotic fervor everyone had
 40957	displayed during the Emperorâs stay was the call for contributions of
 40958	men and money, a necessity that as soon as the promises had been made
 40959	assumed a legal, official form and became unavoidable.
 40960	
 40961	With the enemyâs approach to Moscow, the Moscovitesâ view of their
 40962	situation did not grow more serious but on the contrary became even
 40963	more frivolous, as always happens with people who see a great danger
 40964	approaching. At the approach of danger there are always two voices that
 40965	speak with equal power in the human soul: one very reasonably tells a
 40966	man to consider the nature of the danger and the means of escaping it;
 40967	the other, still more reasonably, says that it is too depressing and
 40968	painful to think of the danger, since it is not in manâs power to
 40969	foresee everything and avert the general course of events, and it is
 40970	therefore better to disregard what is painful till it comes, and to
 40971	think about what is pleasant. In solitude a man generally listens to
 40972	the first voice, but in society to the second. So it was now with the
 40973	inhabitants of Moscow. It was long since people had been as gay in
 40974	Moscow as that year.
 40975	
 40976	RostopchÃ­nâs broadsheets, headed by woodcuts of a drink shop, a potman,
 40977	and a Moscow burgher called KarpÃºshka ChigÃ­rin, âwhoâhaving been a
 40978	militiaman and having had rather too much at the pubâheard that Napoleon
 40979	wished to come to Moscow, grew angry, abused the French in very bad
 40980	language, came out of the drink shop, and, under the sign of the
 40981	eagle, began to address the assembled people,â were read and discussed,
 40982	together with the latest of VasÃ­li LvÃ³vich PÃºshkinâs bouts rimÃ©s.
 40983	
 40984	In the corner room at the Club, members gathered to read these
 40985	broadsheets, and some liked the way KarpÃºshka jeered at the French,
 40986	saying: âThey will swell up with Russian cabbage, burst with our
 40987	buckwheat porridge, and choke themselves with cabbage soup. They are all
 40988	dwarfs and one peasant woman will toss three of them with a hayfork.â
 40989	Others did not like that tone and said it was stupid and vulgar. It was
 40990	said that RostopchÃ­n had expelled all Frenchmen and even all foreigners
 40991	from Moscow, and that there had been some spies and agents of Napoleon
 40992	among them; but this was told chiefly to introduce RostopchÃ­nâs witty
 40993	remark on that occasion. The foreigners were deported to NÃ­zhni by
 40994	boat, and RostopchÃ­n had said to them in French: âRentrez en vous-mÃªmes;
 40995	entrez dans la barque, et nâen faites pas une barque de Charon.â * There
 40996	was talk of all the government offices having been already removed from
 40997	Moscow, and to this ShinshÃ­nâs witticism was addedâthat for that alone
 40998	Moscow ought to be grateful to Napoleon. It was said that MamÃ³novâs
 40999	regiment would cost him eight hundred thousand rubles, and that BezÃºkhov
 41000	had spent even more on his, but that the best thing about BezÃºkhovâs
 41001	action was that he himself was going to don a uniform and ride at the
 41002	head of his regiment without charging anything for the show.
 41003	
 41004	     * âThink it over; get into the barque, and take care not to
 41005	     make it a barque of Charon.â
 41006	
 41007	
 41008	âYou donât spare anyone,â said Julie DrubetskÃ¡ya as she collected
 41009	and pressed together a bunch of raveled lint with her thin, beringed
 41010	fingers.
 41011	
 41012	Julie was preparing to leave Moscow next day and was giving a farewell
 41013	soiree.
 41014	
 41015	âBezÃºkhov est ridicule, but he is so kind and good-natured. What
 41016	pleasure is there to be so caustique?â
 41017	
 41018	âA forfeit!â cried a young man in militia uniform whom Julie called âmon
 41019	chevalier,â and who was going with her to NÃ­zhni.
 41020	
 41021	In Julieâs set, as in many other circles in Moscow, it had been agreed
 41022	that they would speak nothing but Russian and that those who made a
 41023	slip and spoke French should pay fines to the Committee of Voluntary
 41024	Contributions.
 41025	
 41026	âAnother forfeit for a Gallicism,â said a Russian writer who was
 41027	present. ââWhat pleasure is there to beâ is not Russian!â
 41028	
 41029	âYou spare no one,â continued Julie to the young man without heeding the
 41030	authorâs remark.
 41031	
 41032	âFor caustiqueâI am guilty and will pay, and I am prepared to pay again
 41033	for the pleasure of telling you the truth. For Gallicisms I wonât be
 41034	responsible,â she remarked, turning to the author: âI have neither the
 41035	money nor the time, like Prince GalÃ­tsyn, to engage a master to teach me
 41036	Russian!â
 41037	
 41038	âAh, here he is!â she added. âQuand on... No, no,â she said to the
 41039	militia officer, âyou wonât catch me. Speak of the sun and you see its
 41040	rays!â and she smiled amiably at Pierre. âWe were just talking of you,â
 41041	she said with the facility in lying natural to a society woman. âWe were
 41042	saying that your regiment would be sure to be better than MamÃ³novâs.â
 41043	
 41044	âOh, donât talk to me of my regiment,â replied Pierre, kissing his
 41045	hostessâ hand and taking a seat beside her. âI am so sick of it.â
 41046	
 41047	âYou will, of course, command it yourself?â said Julie, directing a sly,
 41048	sarcastic glance toward the militia officer.
 41049	
 41050	The latter in Pierreâs presence had ceased to be caustic, and his face
 41051	expressed perplexity as to what Julieâs smile might mean. In spite of
 41052	his absent-mindedness and good nature, Pierreâs personality immediately
 41053	checked any attempt to ridicule him to his face.
 41054	
 41055	âNo,â said Pierre, with a laughing glance at his big, stout body. âI
 41056	should make too good a target for the French, besides I am afraid I
 41057	should hardly be able to climb onto a horse.â
 41058	
 41059	Among those whom Julieâs guests happened to choose to gossip about were
 41060	the RostÃ³vs.
 41061	
 41062	âI hear that their affairs are in a very bad way,â said Julie. âAnd he
 41063	is so unreasonable, the count himself I mean. The RazumÃ³vskis wanted
 41064	to buy his house and his estate near Moscow, but it drags on and on. He
 41065	asks too much.â
 41066	
 41067	âNo, I think the sale will come off in a few days,â said someone.
 41068	âThough it is madness to buy anything in Moscow now.â
 41069	
 41070	âWhy?â asked Julie. âYou donât think Moscow is in danger?â
 41071	
 41072	âThen why are you leaving?â
 41073	
 41074	âI? What a question! I am going because... well, because everyone is
 41075	going: and besidesâI am not Joan of Arc or an Amazon.â
 41076	
 41077	âWell, of course, of course! Let me have some more strips of linen.â
 41078	
 41079	âIf he manages the business properly he will be able to pay off all his
 41080	debts,â said the militia officer, speaking of RostÃ³v.
 41081	
 41082	âA kindly old man but not up to much. And why do they stay on so long in
 41083	Moscow? They meant to leave for the country long ago. Natalie is quite
 41084	well again now, isnât she?â Julie asked Pierre with a knowing smile.
 41085	
 41086	âThey are waiting for their younger son,â Pierre replied. âHe joined
 41087	ObolÃ©nskiâs Cossacks and went to BÃ©laya TsÃ©rkov where the regiment is
 41088	being formed. But now they have had him transferred to my regiment and
 41089	are expecting him every day. The count wanted to leave long ago, but the
 41090	countess wonât on any account leave Moscow till her son returns.â
 41091	
 41092	âI met them the day before yesterday at the ArkhÃ¡rovsâ. Natalie has
 41093	recovered her looks and is brighter. She sang a song. How easily some
 41094	people get over everything!â
 41095	
 41096	âGet over what?â inquired Pierre, looking displeased.
 41097	
 41098	Julie smiled.
 41099	
 41100	âYou know, Count, such knights as you are only found in Madame de
 41101	Souzaâs novels.â
 41102	
 41103	âWhat knights? What do you mean?â demanded Pierre, blushing.
 41104	
 41105	âOh, come, my dear count! Câest la fable de tout Moscou. Je vous admire,
 41106	ma parole dâhonneur!â *
 41107	
 41108	    * âIt is the talk of all Moscow. My word, I admire you!â
 41109	
 41110	
 41111	âForfeit, forfeit!â cried the militia officer.
 41112	
 41113	âAll right, one canât talkâhow tiresome!â
 41114	
 41115	âWhat is âthe talk of all Moscowâ?â Pierre asked angrily, rising to his
 41116	feet.
 41117	
 41118	âCome now, Count, you know!â
 41119	
 41120	âI donât know anything about it,â said Pierre.
 41121	
 41122	âI know you were friendly with Natalie, and so... but I was always more
 41123	friendly with VÃ©raâthat dear VÃ©ra.â
 41124	
 41125	âNo, madame!â Pierre continued in a tone of displeasure, âI have not
 41126	taken on myself the role of Natalie RostÃ³vaâs knight at all, and have
 41127	not been to their house for nearly a month. But I cannot understand the
 41128	cruelty...â
 41129	
 41130	âQui sâexcuse sâaccuse,â * said Julie, smiling and waving the lint
 41131	triumphantly, and to have the last word she promptly changed the
 41132	subject. âDo you know what I heard today? Poor Mary BolkÃ³nskaya arrived
 41133	in Moscow yesterday. Do you know that she has lost her father?â
 41134	
 41135	    * âWho excuses himself, accuses himself.â
 41136	
 41137	
 41138	âReally? Where is she? I should like very much to see her,â said Pierre.
 41139	
 41140	âI spent the evening with her yesterday. She is going to their estate
 41141	near Moscow either today or tomorrow morning, with her nephew.â
 41142	
 41143	âWell, and how is she?â asked Pierre.
 41144	
 41145	âShe is well, but sad. But do you know who rescued her? It is quite a
 41146	romance. Nicholas RostÃ³v! She was surrounded, and they wanted to kill
 41147	her and had wounded some of her people. He rushed in and saved her....â
 41148	
 41149	âAnother romance,â said the militia officer. âReally, this general
 41150	flight has been arranged to get all the old maids married off. Catiche
 41151	is one and Princess BolkÃ³nskaya another.â
 41152	
 41153	âDo you know, I really believe she is un petit peu amoureuse du jeune
 41154	homme.â *
 41155	
 41156	    * âA little bit in love with the young man.â
 41157	
 41158	
 41159	âForfeit, forfeit, forfeit!â
 41160	
 41161	âBut how could one say that in Russian?â
 41162	
 41163	
 41164	
 41165	
 41166	
 41167	CHAPTER XVIII
 41168	
 41169	When Pierre returned home he was handed two of RostopchÃ­nâs broadsheets
 41170	that had been brought that day.
 41171	
 41172	The first declared that the report that Count RostopchÃ­n had forbidden
 41173	people to leave Moscow was false; on the contrary he was glad that
 41174	ladies and tradesmenâs wives were leaving the city. âThere will be less
 41175	panic and less gossip,â ran the broadsheet âbut I will stake my life on
 41176	it that that scoundrel will not enter Moscow.â These words showed Pierre
 41177	clearly for the first time that the French would enter Moscow. The
 41178	second broadsheet stated that our headquarters were at VyÃ¡zma, that
 41179	Count Wittgenstein had defeated the French, but that as many of the
 41180	inhabitants of Moscow wished to be armed, weapons were ready for them
 41181	at the arsenal: sabers, pistols, and muskets which could be had at a low
 41182	price. The tone of the proclamation was not as jocose as in the former
 41183	ChigÃ­rin talks. Pierre pondered over these broadsheets. Evidently the
 41184	terrible stormcloud he had desired with the whole strength of his soul
 41185	but which yet aroused involuntary horror in him was drawing near.
 41186	
 41187	âShall I join the army and enter the service, or wait?â he asked himself
 41188	for the hundredth time. He took a pack of cards that lay on the table
 41189	and began to lay them out for a game of patience.
 41190	
 41191	âIf this patience comes out,â he said to himself after shuffling the
 41192	cards, holding them in his hand, and lifting his head, âif it comes out,
 41193	it means... what does it mean?â
 41194	
 41195	He had not decided what it should mean when he heard the voice of the
 41196	eldest princess at the door asking whether she might come in.
 41197	
 41198	âThen it will mean that I must go to the army,â said Pierre to himself.
 41199	âCome in, come in!â he added to the princess.
 41200	
 41201	Only the eldest princess, the one with the stony face and long waist,
 41202	was still living in Pierreâs house. The two younger ones had both
 41203	married.
 41204	
 41205	âExcuse my coming to you, cousin,â she said in a reproachful and
 41206	agitated voice. âYou know some decision must be come to. What is going
 41207	to happen? Everyone has left Moscow and the people are rioting. How is
 41208	it that we are staying on?â
 41209	
 41210	âOn the contrary, things seem satisfactory, ma cousine,â said Pierre
 41211	in the bantering tone he habitually adopted toward her, always feeling
 41212	uncomfortable in the role of her benefactor.
 41213	
 41214	âSatisfactory, indeed! Very satisfactory! Barbara IvÃ¡novna told me today
 41215	how our troops are distinguishing themselves. It certainly does them
 41216	credit! And the people too are quite mutinousâthey no longer obey,
 41217	even my maid has taken to being rude. At this rate they will soon begin
 41218	beating us. One canât walk in the streets. But, above all, the French
 41219	will be here any day now, so what are we waiting for? I ask just one
 41220	thing of you, cousin,â she went on, âarrange for me to be taken to
 41221	Petersburg. Whatever I may be, I canât live under Bonaparteâs rule.â
 41222	
 41223	âOh, come, ma cousine! Where do you get your information from? On the
 41224	contrary...â
 41225	
 41226	âI wonât submit to your Napoleon! Others may if they please.... If you
 41227	donât want to do this...â
 41228	
 41229	âBut I will, Iâll give the order at once.â
 41230	
 41231	The princess was apparently vexed at not having anyone to be angry with.
 41232	Muttering to herself, she sat down on a chair.
 41233	
 41234	âBut you have been misinformed,â said Pierre. âEverything is quiet in
 41235	the city and there is not the slightest danger. See! Iâve just been
 41236	reading...â He showed her the broadsheet. âCount RostopchÃ­n writes that
 41237	he will stake his life on it that the enemy will not enter Moscow.â
 41238	
 41239	âOh, that count of yours!â said the princess malevolently. âHe is a
 41240	hypocrite, a rascal who has himself roused the people to riot. Didnât
 41241	he write in those idiotic broadsheets that anyone, âwhoever it might be,
 41242	should be dragged to the lockup by his hairâ? (How silly!) âAnd honor
 41243	and glory to whoever captures him,â he says. This is what his cajolery
 41244	has brought us to! Barbara IvÃ¡novna told me the mob near killed her
 41245	because she said something in French.â
 41246	
 41247	âOh, but itâs so... You take everything so to heart,â said Pierre, and
 41248	began laying out his cards for patience.
 41249	
 41250	Although that patience did come out, Pierre did not join the army,
 41251	but remained in deserted Moscow ever in the same state of agitation,
 41252	irresolution, and alarm, yet at the same time joyfully expecting
 41253	something terrible.
 41254	
 41255	Next day toward evening the princess set off, and Pierreâs head steward
 41256	came to inform him that the money needed for the equipment of his
 41257	regiment could not be found without selling one of the estates. In
 41258	general the head steward made out to Pierre that his project of raising
 41259	a regiment would ruin him. Pierre listened to him, scarcely able to
 41260	repress a smile.
 41261	
 41262	âWell then, sell it,â said he. âWhatâs to be done? I canât draw back
 41263	now!â
 41264	
 41265	The worse everything became, especially his own affairs, the better
 41266	was Pierre pleased and the more evident was it that the catastrophe he
 41267	expected was approaching. Hardly anyone he knew was left in town. Julie
 41268	had gone, and so had Princess Mary. Of his intimate friends only the
 41269	RostÃ³vs remained, but he did not go to see them.
 41270	
 41271	To distract his thoughts he drove that day to the village of VorontsÃ³vo
 41272	to see the great balloon Leppich was constructing to destroy the foe,
 41273	and a trial balloon that was to go up next day. The balloon was not yet
 41274	ready, but Pierre learned that it was being constructed by the Emperorâs
 41275	desire. The Emperor had written to Count RostopchÃ­n as follows:
 41276	
 41277	As soon as Leppich is ready, get together a crew of reliable and
 41278	intelligent men for his car and send a courier to General KutÃºzov to let
 41279	him know. I have informed him of the matter.
 41280	
 41281	Please impress upon Leppich to be very careful where he descends for
 41282	the first time, that he may not make a mistake and fall into the enemyâs
 41283	hands. It is essential for him to combine his movements with those of
 41284	the commander in chief.
 41285	
 41286	
 41287	On his way home from VorontsÃ³vo, as he was passing the BolÃ³tnoe Place
 41288	Pierre, seeing a large crowd round the LÃ³bnoe Place, stopped and got out
 41289	of his trap. A French cook accused of being a spy was being flogged. The
 41290	flogging was only just over, and the executioner was releasing from the
 41291	flogging bench a stout man with red whiskers, in blue stockings and
 41292	a green jacket, who was moaning piteously. Another criminal, thin and
 41293	pale, stood near. Judging by their faces they were both Frenchmen. With
 41294	a frightened and suffering look resembling that on the thin Frenchmanâs
 41295	face, Pierre pushed his way in through the crowd.
 41296	
 41297	âWhat is it? Who is it? What is it for?â he kept asking.
 41298	
 41299	But the attention of the crowdâofficials, burghers, shopkeepers,
 41300	peasants, and women in cloaks and in pelissesâwas so eagerly centered on
 41301	what was passing in LÃ³bnoe Place that no one answered him. The stout man
 41302	rose, frowned, shrugged his shoulders, and evidently trying to appear
 41303	firm began to pull on his jacket without looking about him, but suddenly
 41304	his lips trembled and he began to cry, in the way full-blooded grown-up
 41305	men cry, though angry with himself for doing so. In the crowd people
 41306	began talking loudly, to stifle their feelings of pity as it seemed to
 41307	Pierre.
 41308	
 41309	âHeâs cook to some prince.â
 41310	
 41311	âEh, mounseer, Russian sauce seems to be sour to a Frenchman... sets his
 41312	teeth on edge!â said a wrinkled clerk who was standing behind Pierre,
 41313	when the Frenchman began to cry.
 41314	
 41315	The clerk glanced round, evidently hoping that his joke would be
 41316	appreciated. Some people began to laugh, others continued to watch in
 41317	dismay the executioner who was undressing the other man.
 41318	
 41319	Pierre choked, his face puckered, and he turned hastily away, went back
 41320	to his trap muttering something to himself as he went, and took his
 41321	seat. As they drove along he shuddered and exclaimed several times so
 41322	audibly that the coachman asked him:
 41323	
 41324	âWhat is your pleasure?â
 41325	
 41326	âWhere are you going?â shouted Pierre to the man, who was driving to
 41327	LubyÃ¡nka Street.
 41328	
 41329	âTo the Governorâs, as you ordered,â answered the coachman.
 41330	
 41331	âFool! Idiot!â shouted Pierre, abusing his coachmanâa thing he rarely
 41332	did. âHome, I told you! And drive faster, blockhead!â âI must get away
 41333	this very day,â he murmured to himself.
 41334	
 41335	At the sight of the tortured Frenchman and the crowd surrounding the
 41336	LÃ³bnoe Place, Pierre had so definitely made up his mind that he could no
 41337	longer remain in Moscow and would leave for the army that very day that
 41338	it seemed to him that either he had told the coachman this or that the
 41339	man ought to have known it for himself.
 41340	
 41341	On reaching home Pierre gave orders to EvstÃ¡feyâhis head coachman who
 41342	knew everything, could do anything, and was known to all Moscowâthat
 41343	he would leave that night for the army at MozhÃ¡ysk, and that his saddle
 41344	horses should be sent there. This could not all be arranged that day,
 41345	so on EvstÃ¡feyâs representation Pierre had to put off his departure till
 41346	next day to allow time for the relay horses to be sent on in advance.
 41347	
 41348	On the twenty-fourth the weather cleared up after a spell of rain, and
 41349	after dinner Pierre left Moscow. When changing horses that night
 41350	in PerkhÃºshkovo, he learned that there had been a great battle that
 41351	evening. (This was the battle of ShevÃ¡rdino.) He was told that there in
 41352	PerkhÃºshkovo the earth trembled from the firing, but nobody could answer
 41353	his questions as to who had won. At dawn next day Pierre was approaching
 41354	MozhÃ¡ysk.
 41355	
 41356	Every house in MozhÃ¡ysk had soldiers quartered in it, and at the hostel
 41357	where Pierre was met by his groom and coachman there was no room to be
 41358	had. It was full of officers.
 41359	
 41360	Everywhere in MozhÃ¡ysk and beyond it, troops were stationed or on the
 41361	march. Cossacks, foot and horse soldiers, wagons, caissons, and cannon
 41362	were everywhere. Pierre pushed forward as fast as he could, and the
 41363	farther he left Moscow behind and the deeper he plunged into that sea
 41364	of troops the more was he overcome by restless agitation and a new and
 41365	joyful feeling he had not experienced before. It was a feeling akin
 41366	to what he had felt at the SlobÃ³da Palace during the Emperorâs visitâa
 41367	sense of the necessity of undertaking something and sacrificing
 41368	something. He now experienced a glad consciousness that everything that
 41369	constitutes menâs happinessâthe comforts of life, wealth, even
 41370	life itselfâis rubbish it is pleasant to throw away, compared with
 41371	something... With what? Pierre could not say, and he did not try to
 41372	determine for whom and for what he felt such particular delight in
 41373	sacrificing everything. He was not occupied with the question of what to
 41374	sacrifice for; the fact of sacrificing in itself afforded him a new and
 41375	joyous sensation.

 41381	CHAPTER XIX
 41382	
 41383	On the twenty-fourth of August the battle of the ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubt was
 41384	fought, on the twenty-fifth not a shot was fired by either side, and on
 41385	the twenty-sixth the battle of BorodinÃ³ itself took place.
 41386	
 41387	Why and how were the battles of ShevÃ¡rdino and BorodinÃ³ given and
 41388	accepted? Why was the battle of BorodinÃ³ fought? There was not the least
 41389	sense in it for either the French or the Russians. Its immediate result
 41390	for the Russians was, and was bound to be, that we were brought nearer
 41391	to the destruction of Moscowâwhich we feared more than anything in
 41392	the world; and for the French its immediate result was that they were
 41393	brought nearer to the destruction of their whole armyâwhich they feared
 41394	more than anything in the world. What the result must be was quite
 41395	obvious, and yet Napoleon offered and KutÃºzov accepted that battle.
 41396	
 41397	If the commanders had been guided by reason, it would seem that it must
 41398	have been obvious to Napoleon that by advancing thirteen hundred miles
 41399	and giving battle with a probability of losing a quarter of his army,
 41400	he was advancing to certain destruction, and it must have been equally
 41401	clear to KutÃºzov that by accepting battle and risking the loss of a
 41402	quarter of his army he would certainly lose Moscow. For KutÃºzov this was
 41403	mathematically clear, as it is that if when playing draughts I have one
 41404	man less and go on exchanging, I shall certainly lose, and therefore
 41405	should not exchange. When my opponent has sixteen men and I have
 41406	fourteen, I am only one eighth weaker than he, but when I have exchanged
 41407	thirteen more men he will be three times as strong as I am.
 41408	
 41409	Before the battle of BorodinÃ³ our strength in proportion to the French
 41410	was about as five to six, but after that battle it was little more than
 41411	one to two: previously we had a hundred thousand against a hundred and
 41412	twenty thousand; afterwards little more than fifty thousand against a
 41413	hundred thousand. Yet the shrewd and experienced KutÃºzov accepted the
 41414	battle, while Napoleon, who was said to be a commander of genius,
 41415	gave it, losing a quarter of his army and lengthening his lines of
 41416	communication still more. If it is said that he expected to end the
 41417	campaign by occupying Moscow as he had ended a previous campaign by
 41418	occupying Vienna, there is much evidence to the contrary. Napoleonâs
 41419	historians themselves tell us that from SmolÃ©nsk onwards he wished
 41420	to stop, knew the danger of his extended position, and knew that the
 41421	occupation of Moscow would not be the end of the campaign, for he had
 41422	seen at SmolÃ©nsk the state in which Russian towns were left to him, and
 41423	had not received a single reply to his repeated announcements of his
 41424	wish to negotiate.
 41425	
 41426	In giving and accepting battle at BorodinÃ³, KutÃºzov acted involuntarily
 41427	and irrationally. But later on, to fit what had occurred, the historians
 41428	provided cunningly devised evidence of the foresight and genius of the
 41429	generals who, of all the blind tools of history were the most enslaved
 41430	and involuntary.
 41431	
 41432	The ancients have left us model heroic poems in which the heroes furnish
 41433	the whole interest of the story, and we are still unable to accustom
 41434	ourselves to the fact that for our epoch histories of that kind are
 41435	meaningless.
 41436	
 41437	On the other question, how the battle of BorodinÃ³ and the preceding
 41438	battle of ShevÃ¡rdino were fought, there also exists a definite and
 41439	well-known, but quite false, conception. All the historians describe the
 41440	affair as follows:
 41441	
 41442	The Russian army, they say, in its retreat from SmolÃ©nsk sought out
 41443	for itself the best position for a general engagement and found such a
 41444	position at BorodinÃ³.
 41445	
 41446	The Russians, they say, fortified this position in advance on the left
 41447	of the highroad (from Moscow to SmolÃ©nsk) and almost at a right angle
 41448	to it, from BorodinÃ³ to UtÃ­tsa, at the very place where the battle was
 41449	fought.
 41450	
 41451	In front of this position, they say, a fortified outpost was set up on
 41452	the ShevÃ¡rdino mound to observe the enemy. On the twenty-fourth, we
 41453	are told, Napoleon attacked this advanced post and took it, and, on the
 41454	twenty-sixth, attacked the whole Russian army, which was in position on
 41455	the field of BorodinÃ³.
 41456	
 41457	So the histories say, and it is all quite wrong, as anyone who cares to
 41458	look into the matter can easily convince himself.
 41459	
 41460	The Russians did not seek out the best position but, on the contrary,
 41461	during the retreat passed many positions better than BorodinÃ³. They did
 41462	not stop at any one of these positions because KutÃºzov did not wish to
 41463	occupy a position he had not himself chosen, because the popular demand
 41464	for a battle had not yet expressed itself strongly enough, and because
 41465	MilorÃ¡dovich had not yet arrived with the militia, and for many other
 41466	reasons. The fact is that other positions they had passed were stronger,
 41467	and that the position at BorodinÃ³ (the one where the battle was fought),
 41468	far from being strong, was no more a position than any other spot one
 41469	might find in the Russian Empire by sticking a pin into the map at
 41470	hazard.
 41471	
 41472	Not only did the Russians not fortify the position on the field of
 41473	BorodinÃ³ to the left of, and at a right angle to, the highroad (that
 41474	is, the position on which the battle took place), but never till the
 41475	twenty-fifth of August, 1812, did they think that a battle might be
 41476	fought there. This was shown first by the fact that there were no
 41477	entrenchments there by the twenty fifth and that those begun on the
 41478	twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth were not completed, and secondly, by the
 41479	position of the ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubt. That redoubt was quite senseless
 41480	in front of the position where the battle was accepted. Why was it
 41481	more strongly fortified than any other post? And why were all efforts
 41482	exhausted and six thousand men sacrificed to defend it till late at
 41483	night on the twenty-fourth? A Cossack patrol would have sufficed to
 41484	observe the enemy. Thirdly, as proof that the position on which the
 41485	battle was fought had not been foreseen and that the ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubt
 41486	was not an advanced post of that position, we have the fact that up to
 41487	the twenty-fifth, Barclay de Tolly and BagratiÃ³n were convinced that the
 41488	ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubt was the left flank of the position, and that KutÃºzov
 41489	himself in his report, written in hot haste after the battle, speaks of
 41490	the ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubt as the left flank of the position. It was much
 41491	later, when reports on the battle of BorodinÃ³ were written at leisure,
 41492	that the incorrect and extraordinary statement was invented (probably to
 41493	justify the mistakes of a commander in chief who had to be represented
 41494	as infallible) that the ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubt was an advanced postâwhereas
 41495	in reality it was simply a fortified point on the left flankâand that
 41496	the battle of BorodinÃ³ was fought by us on an entrenched position
 41497	previously selected, whereas it was fought on a quite unexpected spot
 41498	which was almost unentrenched.
 41499	
 41500	The case was evidently this: a position was selected along the river
 41501	KolochÃ¡âwhich crosses the highroad not at a right angle but at an acute
 41502	angleâso that the left flank was at ShevÃ¡rdino, the right flank near the
 41503	village of NÃ³voe, and the center at BorodinÃ³ at the confluence of the
 41504	rivers KolochÃ¡ and VÃ³yna.
 41505	
 41506	To anyone who looks at the field of BorodinÃ³ without thinking of how
 41507	the battle was actually fought, this position, protected by the river
 41508	KolochÃ¡, presents itself as obvious for an army whose object was to
 41509	prevent an enemy from advancing along the SmolÃ©nsk road to Moscow.
 41510	
 41511	Napoleon, riding to ValÃºevo on the twenty-fourth, did not see (as the
 41512	history books say he did) the position of the Russians from UtÃ­tsa
 41513	to BorodinÃ³ (he could not have seen that position because it did not
 41514	exist), nor did he see an advanced post of the Russian army, but while
 41515	pursuing the Russian rearguard he came upon the left flank of the
 41516	Russian positionâat the ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubtâand unexpectedly for the
 41517	Russians moved his army across the KolochÃ¡. And the Russians, not having
 41518	time to begin a general engagement, withdrew their left wing from the
 41519	position they had intended to occupy and took up a new position which
 41520	had not been foreseen and was not fortified. By crossing to the other
 41521	side of the KolochÃ¡ to the left of the highroad, Napoleon shifted the
 41522	whole forthcoming battle from right to left (looking from the Russian
 41523	side) and transferred it to the plain between UtÃ­tsa, SemÃ«novsk, and
 41524	BorodinÃ³âa plain no more advantageous as a position than any other plain
 41525	in Russiaâand there the whole battle of the twenty-sixth of August took
 41526	place.
 41527	
 41528	Had Napoleon not ridden out on the evening of the twenty-fourth to the
 41529	KolochÃ¡, and had he not then ordered an immediate attack on the redoubt
 41530	but had begun the attack next morning, no one would have doubted that
 41531	the ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubt was the left flank of our position, and the
 41532	battle would have taken place where we expected it. In that case
 41533	we should probably have defended the ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubtâour left
 41534	flankâstill more obstinately. We should have attacked Napoleon in the
 41535	center or on the right, and the engagement would have taken place on the
 41536	twenty-fifth, in the position we intended and had fortified. But as the
 41537	attack on our left flank took place in the evening after the retreat of
 41538	our rear guard (that is, immediately after the fight at GridnÃ«va), and
 41539	as the Russian commanders did not wish, or were not in time, to begin a
 41540	general engagement then on the evening of the twenty-fourth, the first
 41541	and chief action of the battle of BorodinÃ³ was already lost on the
 41542	twenty-fourth, and obviously led to the loss of the one fought on the
 41543	twenty-sixth.
 41544	
 41545	After the loss of the ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubt, we found ourselves on the
 41546	morning of the twenty-fifth without a position for our left flank, and
 41547	were forced to bend it back and hastily entrench it where it chanced to
 41548	be.
 41549	
 41550	Not only was the Russian army on the twenty-sixth defended by weak,
 41551	unfinished entrenchments, but the disadvantage of that position was
 41552	increased by the fact that the Russian commandersânot having fully
 41553	realized what had happened, namely the loss of our position on the left
 41554	flank and the shifting of the whole field of the forthcoming battle from
 41555	right to leftâmaintained their extended position from the village of
 41556	NÃ³voe to UtÃ­tsa, and consequently had to move their forces from right to
 41557	left during the battle. So it happened that throughout the whole battle
 41558	the Russians opposed the entire French army launched against our left
 41559	flank with but half as many men. (Poniatowskiâs action against UtÃ­tsa,
 41560	and UvÃ¡rovâs on the right flank against the French, were actions
 41561	distinct from the main course of the battle.) So the battle of BorodinÃ³
 41562	did not take place at all as (in an effort to conceal our commandersâ
 41563	mistakes even at the cost of diminishing the glory due to the Russian
 41564	army and people) it has been described. The battle of BorodinÃ³ was not
 41565	fought on a chosen and entrenched position with forces only slightly
 41566	weaker than those of the enemy, but, as a result of the loss of the
 41567	ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubt, the Russians fought the battle of BorodinÃ³ on an
 41568	open and almost unentrenched position, with forces only half as numerous
 41569	as the French; that is to say, under conditions in which it was not
 41570	merely unthinkable to fight for ten hours and secure an indecisive
 41571	result, but unthinkable to keep an army even from complete
 41572	disintegration and flight.

 41578	CHAPTER XX
 41579	
 41580	On the morning of the twenty-fifth Pierre was leaving MozhÃ¡ysk. At the
 41581	descent of the high steep hill, down which a winding road led out of the
 41582	town past the cathedral on the right, where a service was being held and
 41583	the bells were ringing, Pierre got out of his vehicle and proceeded on
 41584	foot. Behind him a cavalry regiment was coming down the hill preceded by
 41585	its singers. Coming up toward him was a train of carts carrying men who
 41586	had been wounded in the engagement the day before. The peasant drivers,
 41587	shouting and lashing their horses, kept crossing from side to side. The
 41588	carts, in each of which three or four wounded soldiers were lying
 41589	or sitting, jolted over the stones that had been thrown on the steep
 41590	incline to make it something like a road. The wounded, bandaged with
 41591	rags, with pale cheeks, compressed lips, and knitted brows, held on to
 41592	the sides of the carts as they were jolted against one another. Almost
 41593	all of them stared with naÃ¯ve, childlike curiosity at Pierreâs white hat
 41594	and green swallow-tail coat.
 41595	
 41596	Pierreâs coachman shouted angrily at the convoy of wounded to keep to
 41597	one side of the road. The cavalry regiment, as it descended the hill
 41598	with its singers, surrounded Pierreâs carriage and blocked the road.
 41599	Pierre stopped, being pressed against the side of the cutting in which
 41600	the road ran. The sunshine from behind the hill did not penetrate into
 41601	the cutting and there it was cold and damp, but above Pierreâs head was
 41602	the bright August sunshine and the bells sounded merrily. One of the
 41603	carts with wounded stopped by the side of the road close to Pierre. The
 41604	driver in his bast shoes ran panting up to it, placed a stone under one
 41605	of its tireless hind wheels, and began arranging the breech-band on his
 41606	little horse.
 41607	
 41608	One of the wounded, an old soldier with a bandaged arm who was following
 41609	the cart on foot, caught hold of it with his sound hand and turned to
 41610	look at Pierre.
 41611	
 41612	âI say, fellow countryman! Will they set us down here or take us on to
 41613	Moscow?â he asked.
 41614	
 41615	Pierre was so deep in thought that he did not hear the question. He was
 41616	looking now at the cavalry regiment that had met the convoy of wounded,
 41617	now at the cart by which he was standing, in which two wounded men
 41618	were sitting and one was lying. One of those sitting up in the cart had
 41619	probably been wounded in the cheek. His whole head was wrapped in rags
 41620	and one cheek was swollen to the size of a babyâs head. His nose
 41621	and mouth were twisted to one side. This soldier was looking at the
 41622	cathedral and crossing himself. Another, a young lad, a fair-haired
 41623	recruit as white as though there was no blood in his thin face, looked
 41624	at Pierre kindly, with a fixed smile. The third lay prone so that his
 41625	face was not visible. The cavalry singers were passing close by:
 41626	
 41627	   Ah lost, quite lost... is my head so keen,
 41628	   Living in a foreign land...
 41629	
 41630	they sang their soldiersâ dance song.
 41631	
 41632	As if responding to them but with a different sort of merriment, the
 41633	metallic sound of the bells reverberated high above and the hot rays of
 41634	the sun bathed the top of the opposite slope with yet another sort of
 41635	merriment. But beneath the slope, by the cart with the wounded near the
 41636	panting little nag where Pierre stood, it was damp, somber, and sad.
 41637	
 41638	The soldier with the swollen cheek looked angrily at the cavalry
 41639	singers.
 41640	
 41641	âOh, the coxcombs!â he muttered reproachfully.
 41642	
 41643	âItâs not the soldiers only, but Iâve seen peasants today, too....
 41644	The peasantsâeven they have to go,â said the soldier behind the cart,
 41645	addressing Pierre with a sad smile. âNo distinctions made nowadays....
 41646	They want the whole nation to fall on themâin a word, itâs Moscow! They
 41647	want to make an end of it.â
 41648	
 41649	In spite of the obscurity of the soldierâs words Pierre understood what
 41650	he wanted to say and nodded approval.
 41651	
 41652	The road was clear again; Pierre descended the hill and drove on.
 41653	
 41654	He kept looking to either side of the road for familiar faces, but only
 41655	saw everywhere the unfamiliar faces of various military men of different
 41656	branches of the service, who all looked with astonishment at his white
 41657	hat and green tail coat.
 41658	
 41659	Having gone nearly three miles he at last met an acquaintance and
 41660	eagerly addressed him. This was one of the head army doctors. He was
 41661	driving toward Pierre in a covered gig, sitting beside a young surgeon,
 41662	and on recognizing Pierre he told the Cossack who occupied the driverâs
 41663	seat to pull up.
 41664	
 41665	âCount! Your excellency, how come you to be here?â asked the doctor.
 41666	
 41667	âWell, you know, I wanted to see...â
 41668	
 41669	âYes, yes, there will be something to see....â
 41670	
 41671	Pierre got out and talked to the doctor, explaining his intention of
 41672	taking part in a battle.
 41673	
 41674	The doctor advised him to apply direct to KutÃºzov.
 41675	
 41676	âWhy should you be God knows where out of sight, during the battle?â he
 41677	said, exchanging glances with his young companion. âAnyhow his Serene
 41678	Highness knows you and will receive you graciously. Thatâs what you must
 41679	do.â
 41680	
 41681	The doctor seemed tired and in a hurry.
 41682	
 41683	âYou think so?... Ah, I also wanted to ask you where our position is
 41684	exactly?â said Pierre.
 41685	
 41686	âThe position?â repeated the doctor. âWell, thatâs not my line. Drive
 41687	past TatÃ¡rinova, a lot of digging is going on there. Go up the hillock
 41688	and youâll see.â
 41689	
 41690	âCan one see from there?... If you would...â
 41691	
 41692	But the doctor interrupted him and moved toward his gig.
 41693	
 41694	âI would go with you but on my honor Iâm up to hereââand he pointed to
 41695	his throat. âIâm galloping to the commander of the corps. How do matters
 41696	stand?... You know, Count, thereâll be a battle tomorrow. Out of an army
 41697	of a hundred thousand we must expect at least twenty thousand wounded,
 41698	and we havenât stretchers, or bunks, or dressers, or doctors enough for
 41699	six thousand. We have ten thousand carts, but we need other things as
 41700	wellâwe must manage as best we can!â
 41701	
 41702	The strange thought that of the thousands of men, young and old, who
 41703	had stared with merry surprise at his hat (perhaps the very men he had
 41704	noticed), twenty thousand were inevitably doomed to wounds and death
 41705	amazed Pierre.
 41706	
 41707	âThey may die tomorrow; why are they thinking of anything but death?â
 41708	And by some latent sequence of thought the descent of the MozhÃ¡ysk hill,
 41709	the carts with the wounded, the ringing bells, the slanting rays of the
 41710	sun, and the songs of the cavalrymen vividly recurred to his mind.
 41711	
 41712	âThe cavalry ride to battle and meet the wounded and do not for a moment
 41713	think of what awaits them, but pass by, winking at the wounded. Yet from
 41714	among these men twenty thousand are doomed to die, and they wonder at my
 41715	hat! Strange!â thought Pierre, continuing his way to TatÃ¡rinova.
 41716	
 41717	In front of a landownerâs house to the left of the road stood carriages,
 41718	wagons, and crowds of orderlies and sentinels. The commander in chief
 41719	was putting up there, but just when Pierre arrived he was not in and
 41720	hardly any of the staff were thereâthey had gone to the church service.
 41721	Pierre drove on toward GÃ³rki.
 41722	
 41723	When he had ascended the hill and reached the little village street, he
 41724	saw for the first time peasant militiamen in their white shirts and with
 41725	crosses on their caps, who, talking and laughing loudly, animated and
 41726	perspiring, were at work on a huge knoll overgrown with grass to the
 41727	right of the road.
 41728	
 41729	Some of them were digging, others were wheeling barrowloads of earth
 41730	along planks, while others stood about doing nothing.
 41731	
 41732	Two officers were standing on the knoll, directing the men. On seeing
 41733	these peasants, who were evidently still amused by the novelty of their
 41734	position as soldiers, Pierre once more thought of the wounded men at
 41735	MozhÃ¡ysk and understood what the soldier had meant when he said: âThey
 41736	want the whole nation to fall on them.â The sight of these bearded
 41737	peasants at work on the battlefield, with their queer, clumsy boots
 41738	and perspiring necks, and their shirts opening from the left toward
 41739	the middle, unfastened, exposing their sunburned collarbones, impressed
 41740	Pierre more strongly with the solemnity and importance of the moment
 41741	than anything he had yet seen or heard.
 41742	
 41743	
 41744	
 41745	
 41746	
 41747	CHAPTER XXI
 41748	
 41749	Pierre stepped out of his carriage and, passing the toiling militiamen,
 41750	ascended the knoll from which, according to the doctor, the battlefield
 41751	could be seen.
 41752	
 41753	It was about eleven oâclock. The sun shone somewhat to the left and
 41754	behind him and brightly lit up the enormous panorama which, rising like
 41755	an amphitheater, extended before him in the clear rarefied atmosphere.
 41756	
 41757	From above on the left, bisecting that amphitheater, wound the SmolÃ©nsk
 41758	highroad, passing through a village with a white church some five
 41759	hundred paces in front of the knoll and below it. This was BorodinÃ³.
 41760	Below the village the road crossed the river by a bridge and, winding
 41761	down and up, rose higher and higher to the village of ValÃºevo visible
 41762	about four miles away, where Napoleon was then stationed. Beyond ValÃºevo
 41763	the road disappeared into a yellowing forest on the horizon. Far in
 41764	the distance in that birch and fir forest to the right of the road, the
 41765	cross and belfry of the KolochÃ¡ Monastery gleamed in the sun. Here and
 41766	there over the whole of that blue expanse, to right and left of the
 41767	forest and the road, smoking campfires could be seen and indefinite
 41768	masses of troopsâours and the enemyâs. The ground to the rightâalong the
 41769	course of the KolochÃ¡ and MoskvÃ¡ riversâwas broken and hilly. Between
 41770	the hollows the villages of BezÃºbova and ZakhÃ¡rino showed in the
 41771	distance. On the left the ground was more level; there were fields of
 41772	grain, and the smoking ruins of SemÃ«novsk, which had been burned down,
 41773	could be seen.
 41774	
 41775	All that Pierre saw was so indefinite that neither the left nor the
 41776	right side of the field fully satisfied his expectations. Nowhere
 41777	could he see the battlefield he had expected to find, but only fields,
 41778	meadows, troops, woods, the smoke of campfires, villages, mounds, and
 41779	streams; and try as he would he could descry no military âpositionâ in
 41780	this place which teemed with life, nor could he even distinguish our
 41781	troops from the enemyâs.
 41782	
 41783	âI must ask someone who knows,â he thought, and addressed an officer who
 41784	was looking with curiosity at his huge unmilitary figure.
 41785	
 41786	âMay I ask you,â said Pierre, âwhat village that is in front?â
 41787	
 41788	âBÃºrdino, isnât it?â said the officer, turning to his companion.
 41789	
 41790	âBorodinÃ³,â the other corrected him.
 41791	
 41792	The officer, evidently glad of an opportunity for a talk, moved up to
 41793	Pierre.
 41794	
 41795	âAre those our men there?â Pierre inquired.
 41796	
 41797	âYes, and there, further on, are the French,â said the officer. âThere
 41798	they are, there... you can see them.â
 41799	
 41800	âWhere? Where?â asked Pierre.
 41801	
 41802	âOne can see them with the naked eye... Why, there!â
 41803	
 41804	The officer pointed with his hand to the smoke visible on the left
 41805	beyond the river, and the same stern and serious expression that Pierre
 41806	had noticed on many of the faces he had met came into his face.
 41807	
 41808	âAh, those are the French! And over there?...â Pierre pointed to a knoll
 41809	on the left, near which some troops could be seen.
 41810	
 41811	âThose are ours.â
 41812	
 41813	âAh, ours! And there?...â Pierre pointed to another knoll in the
 41814	distance with a big tree on it, near a village that lay in a hollow
 41815	where also some campfires were smoking and something black was visible.
 41816	
 41817	âThatâs his again,â said the officer. (It was the ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubt.)
 41818	âIt was ours yesterday, but now it is his.â
 41819	
 41820	âThen how about our position?â
 41821	
 41822	âOur position?â replied the officer with a smile of satisfaction. âI
 41823	can tell you quite clearly, because I constructed nearly all our
 41824	entrenchments. There, you see? Thereâs our center, at BorodinÃ³, just
 41825	there,â and he pointed to the village in front of them with the white
 41826	church. âThatâs where one crosses the KolochÃ¡. You see down there where
 41827	the rows of hay are lying in the hollow, thereâs the bridge. Thatâs our
 41828	center. Our right flank is over thereââhe pointed sharply to the right,
 41829	far away in the broken groundââThatâs where the MoskvÃ¡ River is, and
 41830	we have thrown up three redoubts there, very strong ones. The left
 41831	flank...â here the officer paused. âWell, you see, thatâs difficult to
 41832	explain.... Yesterday our left flank was there at ShevÃ¡rdino, you see,
 41833	where the oak is, but now we have withdrawn our left wingânow it is over
 41834	there, do you see that village and the smoke? Thatâs SemÃ«novsk, yes,
 41835	there,â he pointed to RaÃ©vskiâs knoll. âBut the battle will hardly
 41836	be there. His having moved his troops there is only a ruse; he will
 41837	probably pass round to the right of the MoskvÃ¡. But wherever it may be,
 41838	many a man will be missing tomorrow!â he remarked.
 41839	
 41840	An elderly sergeant who had approached the officer while he was giving
 41841	these explanations had waited in silence for him to finish speaking, but
 41842	at this point, evidently not liking the officerâs remark, interrupted
 41843	him.
 41844	
 41845	âGabions must be sent for,â said he sternly.
 41846	
 41847	The officer appeared abashed, as though he understood that one might
 41848	think of how many men would be missing tomorrow but ought not to speak
 41849	of it.
 41850	
 41851	âWell, send number three company again,â the officer replied hurriedly.
 41852	
 41853	âAnd you, are you one of the doctors?â
 41854	
 41855	âNo, Iâve come on my own,â answered Pierre, and he went down the hill
 41856	again, passing the militiamen.
 41857	
 41858	âOh, those damned fellows!â muttered the officer who followed him,
 41859	holding his nose as he ran past the men at work.
 41860	
 41861	âThere they are... bringing her, coming... There they are... Theyâll be
 41862	here in a minute...â voices were suddenly heard saying; and officers,
 41863	soldiers, and militiamen began running forward along the road.
 41864	
 41865	A church procession was coming up the hill from BorodinÃ³. First along
 41866	the dusty road came the infantry in ranks, bareheaded and with arms
 41867	reversed. From behind them came the sound of church singing.
 41868	
 41869	Soldiers and militiamen ran bareheaded past Pierre toward the
 41870	procession.
 41871	
 41872	âThey are bringing her, our Protectress!... The Iberian Mother of God!â
 41873	someone cried.
 41874	
 41875	âThe SmolÃ©nsk Mother of God,â another corrected him.
 41876	
 41877	The militiamen, both those who had been in the village and those who had
 41878	been at work on the battery, threw down their spades and ran to meet the
 41879	church procession. Following the battalion that marched along the dusty
 41880	road came priests in their vestmentsâone little old man in a hood with
 41881	attendants and singers. Behind them soldiers and officers bore a large,
 41882	dark-faced icon with an embossed metal cover. This was the icon that had
 41883	been brought from SmolÃ©nsk and had since accompanied the army. Behind,
 41884	before, and on both sides, crowds of militiamen with bared heads walked,
 41885	ran, and bowed to the ground.
 41886	
 41887	At the summit of the hill they stopped with the icon; the men who had
 41888	been holding it up by the linen bands attached to it were relieved by
 41889	others, the chanters relit their censers, and service began. The hot
 41890	rays of the sun beat down vertically and a fresh soft wind played with
 41891	the hair of the bared heads and with the ribbons decorating the icon.
 41892	The singing did not sound loud under the open sky. An immense crowd
 41893	of bareheaded officers, soldiers, and militiamen surrounded the icon.
 41894	Behind the priest and a chanter stood the notabilities on a spot
 41895	reserved for them. A bald general with a St. Georgeâs Cross on his neck
 41896	stood just behind the priestâs back, and without crossing himself (he
 41897	was evidently a German) patiently awaited the end of the service, which
 41898	he considered it necessary to hear to the end, probably to arouse the
 41899	patriotism of the Russian people. Another general stood in a martial
 41900	pose, crossing himself by shaking his hand in front of his chest
 41901	while looking about him. Standing among the crowd of peasants, Pierre
 41902	recognized several acquaintances among these notables, but did not
 41903	look at themâhis whole attention was absorbed in watching the serious
 41904	expression on the faces of the crowd of soldiers and militiamen who were
 41905	all gazing eagerly at the icon. As soon as the tired chanters, who were
 41906	singing the service for the twentieth time that day, began lazily and
 41907	mechanically to sing: âSave from calamity Thy servants, O Mother of
 41908	God,â and the priest and deacon chimed in: âFor to Thee under God we all
 41909	flee as to an inviolable bulwark and protection,â there again kindled in
 41910	all those faces the same expression of consciousness of the solemnity
 41911	of the impending moment that Pierre had seen on the faces at the foot of
 41912	the hill at MozhÃ¡ysk and momentarily on many and many faces he had met
 41913	that morning; and heads were bowed more frequently and hair tossed back,
 41914	and sighs and the sound men made as they crossed themselves were heard.
 41915	
 41916	The crowd round the icon suddenly parted and pressed against Pierre.
 41917	Someone, a very important personage judging by the haste with which way
 41918	was made for him, was approaching the icon.
 41919	
 41920	It was KutÃºzov, who had been riding round the position and on his way
 41921	back to TatÃ¡rinova had stopped where the service was being held. Pierre
 41922	recognized him at once by his peculiar figure, which distinguished him
 41923	from everybody else.
 41924	
 41925	With a long overcoat on his exceedingly stout, round-shouldered body,
 41926	with uncovered white head and puffy face showing the white ball of the
 41927	eye he had lost, KutÃºzov walked with plunging, swaying gait into
 41928	the crowd and stopped behind the priest. He crossed himself with an
 41929	accustomed movement, bent till he touched the ground with his hand, and
 41930	bowed his white head with a deep sigh. Behind KutÃºzov was Bennigsen and
 41931	the suite. Despite the presence of the commander in chief, who attracted
 41932	the attention of all the superior officers, the militiamen and soldiers
 41933	continued their prayers without looking at him.
 41934	
 41935	When the service was over, KutÃºzov stepped up to the icon, sank heavily
 41936	to his knees, bowed to the ground, and for a long time tried vainly to
 41937	rise, but could not do so on account of his weakness and weight. His
 41938	white head twitched with the effort. At last he rose, kissed the icon as
 41939	a child does with naÃ¯vely pouting lips, and again bowed till he touched
 41940	the ground with his hand. The other generals followed his example,
 41941	then the officers, and after them with excited faces, pressing on one
 41942	another, crowding, panting, and pushing, scrambled the soldiers and
 41943	militiamen.
 41944	
 41945	
 41946	
 41947	
 41948	
 41949	CHAPTER XXII
 41950	
 41951	Staggering amid the crush, Pierre looked about him.
 41952	
 41953	âCount Peter KirÃ­lovich! How did you get here?â said a voice.
 41954	
 41955	Pierre looked round. BorÃ­s DrubetskÃ³y, brushing his knees with his hand
 41956	(he had probably soiled them when he, too, had knelt before the icon),
 41957	came up to him smiling. BorÃ­s was elegantly dressed, with a slightly
 41958	martial touch appropriate to a campaign. He wore a long coat and like
 41959	KutÃºzov had a whip slung across his shoulder.
 41960	
 41961	Meanwhile KutÃºzov had reached the village and seated himself in the
 41962	shade of the nearest house, on a bench which one Cossack had run
 41963	to fetch and another had hastily covered with a rug. An immense and
 41964	brilliant suite surrounded him.
 41965	
 41966	The icon was carried further, accompanied by the throng. Pierre stopped
 41967	some thirty paces from KutÃºzov, talking to BorÃ­s.
 41968	
 41969	He explained his wish to be present at the battle and to see the
 41970	position.
 41971	
 41972	âThis is what you must do,â said BorÃ­s. âI will do the honors of the
 41973	camp to you. You will see everything best from where Count Bennigsen
 41974	will be. I am in attendance on him, you know; Iâll mention it to him.
 41975	But if you want to ride round the position, come along with us. We are
 41976	just going to the left flank. Then when we get back, do spend the night
 41977	with me and weâll arrange a game of cards. Of course you know DmÃ­tri
 41978	SergÃ©evich? Those are his quarters,â and he pointed to the third house
 41979	in the village of GÃ³rki.
 41980	
 41981	âBut I should like to see the right flank. They say itâs very strong,â
 41982	said Pierre. âI should like to start from the MoskvÃ¡ River and ride
 41983	round the whole position.â
 41984	
 41985	âWell, you can do that later, but the chief thing is the left flank.â
 41986	
 41987	âYes, yes. But where is Prince BolkÃ³nskiâs regiment? Can you point it
 41988	out to me?â
 41989	
 41990	âPrince Andrewâs? We shall pass it and Iâll take you to him.â
 41991	
 41992	âWhat about the left flank?â asked Pierre
 41993	
 41994	âTo tell you the truth, between ourselves, God only knows what state our
 41995	left flank is in,â said BorÃ­s confidentially lowering his voice. âIt is
 41996	not at all what Count Bennigsen intended. He meant to fortify that knoll
 41997	quite differently, but...â BorÃ­s shrugged his shoulders, âhis Serene
 41998	Highness would not have it, or someone persuaded him. You see...â but
 41999	BorÃ­s did not finish, for at that moment KaysÃ¡rov, KutÃºzovâs adjutant,
 42000	came up to Pierre. âAh, KaysÃ¡rov!â said BorÃ­s, addressing him with an
 42001	unembarrassed smile, âI was just trying to explain our position to
 42002	the count. It is amazing how his Serene Highness could so foresee the
 42003	intentions of the French!â
 42004	
 42005	âYou mean the left flank?â asked KaysÃ¡rov.
 42006	
 42007	âYes, exactly; the left flank is now extremely strong.â
 42008	
 42009	Though KutÃºzov had dismissed all unnecessary men from the staff, BorÃ­s
 42010	had contrived to remain at headquarters after the changes. He had
 42011	established himself with Count Bennigsen, who, like all on whom BorÃ­s
 42012	had been in attendance, considered young Prince DrubetskÃ³y an invaluable
 42013	man.
 42014	
 42015	In the higher command there were two sharply defined parties: KutÃºzovâs
 42016	party and that of Bennigsen, the chief of staff. BorÃ­s belonged to the
 42017	latter and no one else, while showing servile respect to KutÃºzov, could
 42018	so create an impression that the old fellow was not much good and that
 42019	Bennigsen managed everything. Now the decisive moment of battle had come
 42020	when KutÃºzov would be destroyed and the power pass to Bennigsen, or even
 42021	if KutÃºzov won the battle it would be felt that everything was done by
 42022	Bennigsen. In any case many great rewards would have to be given for
 42023	tomorrowâs action, and new men would come to the front. So BorÃ­s was
 42024	full of nervous vivacity all day.
 42025	
 42026	After KaysÃ¡rov, others whom Pierre knew came up to him, and he had not
 42027	time to reply to all the questions about Moscow that were showered upon
 42028	him, or to listen to all that was told him. The faces all expressed
 42029	animation and apprehension, but it seemed to Pierre that the cause of
 42030	the excitement shown in some of these faces lay chiefly in questions
 42031	of personal success; his mind, however, was occupied by the different
 42032	expression he saw on other facesâan expression that spoke not of
 42033	personal matters but of the universal questions of life and death.
 42034	KutÃºzov noticed Pierreâs figure and the group gathered round him.
 42035	
 42036	âCall him to me,â said KutÃºzov.
 42037	
 42038	An adjutant told Pierre of his Serene Highnessâ wish, and Pierre went
 42039	toward KutÃºzovâs bench. But a militiaman got there before him. It was
 42040	DÃ³lokhov.
 42041	
 42042	âHow did that fellow get here?â asked Pierre.
 42043	
 42044	âHeâs a creature that wriggles in anywhere!â was the answer. âHe
 42045	has been degraded, you know. Now he wants to bob up again. Heâs been
 42046	proposing some scheme or other and has crawled into the enemyâs picket
 42047	line at night.... Heâs a brave fellow.â
 42048	
 42049	Pierre took off his hat and bowed respectfully to KutÃºzov.
 42050	
 42051	âI concluded that if I reported to your Serene Highness you might send
 42052	me away or say that you knew what I was reporting, but then I shouldnât
 42053	lose anything...â DÃ³lokhov was saying.
 42054	
 42055	âYes, yes.â
 42056	
 42057	âBut if I were right, I should be rendering a service to my Fatherland
 42058	for which I am ready to die.â
 42059	
 42060	âYes, yes.â
 42061	
 42062	âAnd should your Serene Highness require a man who will not spare his
 42063	skin, please think of me.... Perhaps I may prove useful to your Serene
 42064	Highness.â
 42065	
 42066	âYes... Yes...â KutÃºzov repeated, his laughing eye narrowing more and
 42067	more as he looked at Pierre.
 42068	
 42069	Just then BorÃ­s, with his courtierlike adroitness, stepped up to
 42070	Pierreâs side near KutÃºzov and in a most natural manner, without
 42071	raising his voice, said to Pierre, as though continuing an interrupted
 42072	conversation:
 42073	
 42074	âThe militia have put on clean white shirts to be ready to die. What
 42075	heroism, Count!â
 42076	
 42077	BorÃ­s evidently said this to Pierre in order to be overheard by his
 42078	Serene Highness. He knew KutÃºzovâs attention would be caught by those
 42079	words, and so it was.
 42080	
 42081	âWhat are you saying about the militia?â he asked BorÃ­s.
 42082	
 42083	âPreparing for tomorrow, your Serene Highnessâfor deathâthey have put on
 42084	clean shirts.â
 42085	
 42086	âAh... a wonderful, a matchless people!â said KutÃºzov; and he closed his
 42087	eyes and swayed his head. âA matchless people!â he repeated with a sigh.
 42088	
 42089	âSo you want to smell gunpowder?â he said to Pierre. âYes, itâs a
 42090	pleasant smell. I have the honor to be one of your wifeâs adorers. Is
 42091	she well? My quarters are at your service.â
 42092	
 42093	And as often happens with old people, KutÃºzov began looking about
 42094	absent-mindedly as if forgetting all he wanted to say or do.
 42095	
 42096	Then, evidently remembering what he wanted, he beckoned to Andrew
 42097	KaysÃ¡rov, his adjutantâs brother.
 42098	
 42099	âThose verses... those verses of MÃ¡rinâs... how do they go, eh? Those he
 42100	wrote about GerÃ¡kov: âLectures for the corps inditingâ... Recite them,
 42101	recite them!â said he, evidently preparing to laugh.
 42102	
 42103	KaysÃ¡rov recited.... KutÃºzov smilingly nodded his head to the rhythm of
 42104	the verses.
 42105	
 42106	When Pierre had left KutÃºzov, DÃ³lokhov came up to him and took his hand.
 42107	
 42108	âI am very glad to meet you here, Count,â he said aloud, regardless
 42109	of the presence of strangers and in a particularly resolute and solemn
 42110	tone. âOn the eve of a day when God alone knows who of us is fated to
 42111	survive, I am glad of this opportunity to tell you that I regret the
 42112	misunderstandings that occurred between us and should wish you not to
 42113	have any ill feeling for me. I beg you to forgive me.â
 42114	
 42115	Pierre looked at DÃ³lokhov with a smile, not knowing what to say to him.
 42116	With tears in his eyes DÃ³lokhov embraced Pierre and kissed him.
 42117	
 42118	BorÃ­s said a few words to his general, and Count Bennigsen turned to
 42119	Pierre and proposed that he should ride with him along the line.
 42120	
 42121	âIt will interest you,â said he.
 42122	
 42123	âYes, very much,â replied Pierre.
 42124	
 42125	Half an hour later KutÃºzov left for TatÃ¡rinova, and Bennigsen and his
 42126	suite, with Pierre among them, set out on their ride along the line.
 42127	
 42128	
 42129	
 42130	
 42131	
 42132	CHAPTER XXIII
 42133	
 42134	From GÃ³rki, Bennigsen descended the highroad to the bridge which, when
 42135	they had looked at it from the hill, the officer had pointed out as
 42136	being the center of our position and where rows of fragrant new-mown hay
 42137	lay by the riverside. They rode across that bridge into the village of
 42138	BorodinÃ³ and thence turned to the left, passing an enormous number of
 42139	troops and guns, and came to a high knoll where militiamen were digging.
 42140	This was the redoubt, as yet unnamed, which afterwards became known as
 42141	the RaÃ©vski Redoubt, or the Knoll Battery, but Pierre paid no special
 42142	attention to it. He did not know that it would become more memorable to
 42143	him than any other spot on the plain of BorodinÃ³.
 42144	
 42145	They then crossed the hollow to SemÃ«novsk, where the soldiers were
 42146	dragging away the last logs from the huts and barns. Then they rode
 42147	downhill and uphill, across a ryefield trodden and beaten down as if by
 42148	hail, following a track freshly made by the artillery over the furrows
 42149	of the plowed land, and reached some flÃ¨ches * which were still being
 42150	dug.
 42151	
 42152	    * A kind of entrenchment.
 42153	
 42154	At the flÃ¨ches Bennigsen stopped and began looking at the ShevÃ¡rdino
 42155	Redoubt opposite, which had been ours the day before and where several
 42156	horsemen could be descried. The officers said that either Napoleon or
 42157	Murat was there, and they all gazed eagerly at this little group of
 42158	horsemen. Pierre also looked at them, trying to guess which of the
 42159	scarcely discernible figures was Napoleon. At last those mounted men
 42160	rode away from the mound and disappeared.
 42161	
 42162	Bennigsen spoke to a general who approached him, and began explaining
 42163	the whole position of our troops. Pierre listened to him, straining each
 42164	faculty to understand the essential points of the impending battle, but
 42165	was mortified to feel that his mental capacity was inadequate for the
 42166	task. He could make nothing of it. Bennigsen stopped speaking and,
 42167	noticing that Pierre was listening, suddenly said to him:
 42168	
 42169	âI donât think this interests you?â
 42170	
 42171	âOn the contrary itâs very interesting!â replied Pierre not quite
 42172	truthfully.
 42173	
 42174	From the flÃ¨ches they rode still farther to the left, along a road
 42175	winding through a thick, low-growing birch wood. In the middle of the
 42176	wood a brown hare with white feet sprang out and, scared by the tramp of
 42177	the many horses, grew so confused that it leaped along the road in front
 42178	of them for some time, arousing general attention and laughter, and only
 42179	when several voices shouted at it did it dart to one side and disappear
 42180	in the thicket. After going through the wood for about a mile and a half
 42181	they came out on a glade where troops of TÃºchkovâs corps were stationed
 42182	to defend the left flank.
 42183	
 42184	Here, at the extreme left flank, Bennigsen talked a great deal and with
 42185	much heat, and, as it seemed to Pierre, gave orders of great military
 42186	importance. In front of TÃºchkovâs troops was some high ground not
 42187	occupied by troops. Bennigsen loudly criticized this mistake, saying
 42188	that it was madness to leave a height which commanded the country around
 42189	unoccupied and to place troops below it. Some of the generals expressed
 42190	the same opinion. One in particular declared with martial heat that they
 42191	were put there to be slaughtered. Bennigsen on his own authority ordered
 42192	the troops to occupy the high ground. This disposition on the left flank
 42193	increased Pierreâs doubt of his own capacity to understand military
 42194	matters. Listening to Bennigsen and the generals criticizing the
 42195	position of the troops behind the hill, he quite understood them and
 42196	shared their opinion, but for that very reason he could not understand
 42197	how the man who put them there behind the hill could have made so gross
 42198	and palpable a blunder.
 42199	
 42200	Pierre did not know that these troops were not, as Bennigsen supposed,
 42201	put there to defend the position, but were in a concealed position as
 42202	an ambush, that they should not be seen and might be able to strike an
 42203	approaching enemy unexpectedly. Bennigsen did not know this and moved
 42204	the troops forward according to his own ideas without mentioning the
 42205	matter to the commander in chief.
 42206

 42211	CHAPTER XXIV
 42212	
 42213	On that bright evening of August 25, Prince Andrew lay leaning on his
 42214	elbow in a broken-down shed in the village of KnyazkÃ³vo at the further
 42215	end of his regimentâs encampment. Through a gap in the broken wall he
 42216	could see, beside the wooden fence, a row of thirty-year-old birches
 42217	with their lower branches lopped off, a field on which shocks of
 42218	oats were standing, and some bushes near which rose the smoke of
 42219	campfiresâthe soldiersâ kitchens.
 42220	
 42221	Narrow and burdensome and useless to anyone as his life now seemed to
 42222	him, Prince Andrew on the eve of battle felt agitated and irritable as
 42223	he had done seven years before at Austerlitz.
 42224	
 42225	He had received and given the orders for next dayâs battle and had
 42226	nothing more to do. But his thoughtsâthe simplest, clearest, and
 42227	therefore most terrible thoughtsâwould give him no peace. He knew that
 42228	tomorrowâs battle would be the most terrible of all he had taken
 42229	part in, and for the first time in his life the possibility of death
 42230	presented itself to himânot in relation to any worldly matter or with
 42231	reference to its effect on others, but simply in relation to himself, to
 42232	his own soulâvividly, plainly, terribly, and almost as a certainty. And
 42233	from the height of this perception all that had previously tormented and
 42234	preoccupied him suddenly became illumined by a cold white light without
 42235	shadows, without perspective, without distinction of outline. All life
 42236	appeared to him like magic-lantern pictures at which he had long been
 42237	gazing by artificial light through a glass. Now he suddenly saw those
 42238	badly daubed pictures in clear daylight and without a glass. âYes,
 42239	yes! There they are, those false images that agitated, enraptured,
 42240	and tormented me,â said he to himself, passing in review the principal
 42241	pictures of the magic lantern of life and regarding them now in the cold
 42242	white daylight of his clear perception of death. âThere they are, those
 42243	rudely painted figures that once seemed splendid and mysterious.
 42244	Glory, the good of society, love of a woman, the Fatherland itselfâhow
 42245	important these pictures appeared to me, with what profound meaning they
 42246	seemed to be filled! And it is all so simple, pale, and crude in the
 42247	cold white light of this morning which I feel is dawning for me.â The
 42248	three great sorrows of his life held his attention in particular: his
 42249	love for a woman, his fatherâs death, and the French invasion which had
 42250	overrun half Russia. âLove... that little girl who seemed to me brimming
 42251	over with mystic forces! Yes, indeed, I loved her. I made romantic plans
 42252	of love and happiness with her! Oh, what a boy I was!â he said aloud
 42253	bitterly. âAh me! I believed in some ideal love which was to keep her
 42254	faithful to me for the whole year of my absence! Like the gentle dove
 42255	in the fable she was to pine apart from me.... But it was much simpler
 42256	really.... It was all very simple and horrible.â
 42257	
 42258	âWhen my father built Bald Hills he thought the place was his: his
 42259	land, his air, his peasants. But Napoleon came and swept him aside,
 42260	unconscious of his existence, as he might brush a chip from his path,
 42261	and his Bald Hills and his whole life fell to pieces. Princess Mary says
 42262	it is a trial sent from above. What is the trial for, when he is not
 42263	here and will never return? He is not here! For whom then is the trial
 42264	intended? The Fatherland, the destruction of Moscow! And tomorrow I
 42265	shall be killed, perhaps not even by a Frenchman but by one of our own
 42266	men, by a soldier discharging a musket close to my ear as one of them
 42267	did yesterday, and the French will come and take me by head and heels
 42268	and fling me into a hole that I may not stink under their noses, and new
 42269	conditions of life will arise, which will seem quite ordinary to others
 42270	and about which I shall know nothing. I shall not exist....â
 42271	
 42272	He looked at the row of birches shining in the sunshine, with their
 42273	motionless green and yellow foliage and white bark. âTo die... to be
 42274	killed tomorrow... That I should not exist... That all this should still
 42275	be, but no me....â
 42276	
 42277	And the birches with their light and shade, the curly clouds, the
 42278	smoke of the campfires, and all that was around him changed and seemed
 42279	terrible and menacing. A cold shiver ran down his spine. He rose
 42280	quickly, went out of the shed, and began to walk about.
 42281	
 42282	After he had returned, voices were heard outside the shed. âWhoâs that?â
 42283	he cried.
 42284	
 42285	The red-nosed Captain TimÃ³khin, formerly DÃ³lokhovâs squadron commander,
 42286	but now from lack of officers a battalion commander, shyly entered the
 42287	shed followed by an adjutant and the regimental paymaster.
 42288	
 42289	Prince Andrew rose hastily, listened to the business they had come
 42290	about, gave them some further instructions, and was about to dismiss
 42291	them when he heard a familiar, lisping, voice behind the shed.
 42292	
 42293	âDevil take it!â said the voice of a man stumbling over something.
 42294	
 42295	Prince Andrew looked out of the shed and saw Pierre, who had tripped
 42296	over a pole on the ground and had nearly fallen, coming his way. It was
 42297	unpleasant to Prince Andrew to meet people of his own set in general,
 42298	and Pierre especially, for he reminded him of all the painful moments of
 42299	his last visit to Moscow.
 42300	
 42301	âYou? What a surprise!â said he. âWhat brings you here? This is
 42302	unexpected!â
 42303	
 42304	As he said this his eyes and face expressed more than coldnessâthey
 42305	expressed hostility, which Pierre noticed at once. He had approached
 42306	the shed full of animation, but on seeing Prince Andrewâs face he felt
 42307	constrained and ill at ease.
 42308	
 42309	âI have come... simply... you know... come... it interests me,â said
 42310	Pierre, who had so often that day senselessly repeated that word
 42311	âinteresting.â âI wish to see the battle.â
 42312	
 42313	âOh yes, and what do the Masonic brothers say about war? How would they
 42314	stop it?â said Prince Andrew sarcastically. âWell, and howâs Moscow? And
 42315	my people? Have they reached Moscow at last?â he asked seriously.
 42316	
 42317	âYes, they have. Julie DrubetskÃ¡ya told me so. I went to see them, but
 42318	missed them. They have gone to your estate near Moscow.â
 42319	
 42320	
 42321	
 42322	
 42323	
 42324	CHAPTER XXV
 42325	
 42326	The officers were about to take leave, but Prince Andrew, apparently
 42327	reluctant to be left alone with his friend, asked them to stay and have
 42328	tea. Seats were brought in and so was the tea. The officers gazed with
 42329	surprise at Pierreâs huge stout figure and listened to his talk of
 42330	Moscow and the position of our army, round which he had ridden. Prince
 42331	Andrew remained silent, and his expression was so forbidding that Pierre
 42332	addressed his remarks chiefly to the good-natured battalion commander.
 42333	
 42334	âSo you understand the whole position of our troops?â Prince Andrew
 42335	interrupted him.
 42336	
 42337	âYesâthat is, how do you mean?â said Pierre. âNot being a military man
 42338	I canât say I have understood it fully, but I understand the general
 42339	position.â
 42340	
 42341	âWell, then, you know more than anyone else, be it who it may,â said
 42342	Prince Andrew.
 42343	
 42344	âOh!â said Pierre, looking over his spectacles in perplexity at Prince
 42345	Andrew. âWell, and what do you think of KutÃºzovâs appointment?â he
 42346	asked.
 42347	
 42348	âI was very glad of his appointment, thatâs all I know,â replied Prince
 42349	Andrew.
 42350	
 42351	âAnd tell me your opinion of Barclay de Tolly. In Moscow they are saying
 42352	heaven knows what about him.... What do you think of him?â
 42353	
 42354	âAsk them,â replied Prince Andrew, indicating the officers.
 42355	
 42356	Pierre looked at TimÃ³khin with the condescendingly interrogative smile
 42357	with which everybody involuntarily addressed that officer.
 42358	
 42359	âWe see light again, since his Serenity has been appointed, your
 42360	excellency,â said TimÃ³khin timidly, and continually turning to glance at
 42361	his colonel.
 42362	
 42363	âWhy so?â asked Pierre.
 42364	
 42365	âWell, to mention only firewood and fodder, let me inform you. Why, when
 42366	we were retreating from SventsyÃ¡ni we dare not touch a stick or a wisp
 42367	of hay or anything. You see, we were going away, so he would get it all;
 42368	wasnât it so, your excellency?â and again TimÃ³khin turned to the prince.
 42369	âBut we darenât. In our regiment two officers were court-martialed for
 42370	that kind of thing. But when his Serenity took command everything became
 42371	straightforward. Now we see light....â
 42372	
 42373	âThen why was it forbidden?â
 42374	
 42375	TimÃ³khin looked about in confusion, not knowing what or how to answer
 42376	such a question. Pierre put the same question to Prince Andrew.
 42377	
 42378	âWhy, so as not to lay waste the country we were abandoning to the
 42379	enemy,â said Prince Andrew with venomous irony. âIt is very sound:
 42380	one canât permit the land to be pillaged and accustom the troops to
 42381	marauding. At SmolÃ©nsk too he judged correctly that the French might
 42382	outflank us, as they had larger forces. But he could not understand
 42383	this,â cried Prince Andrew in a shrill voice that seemed to escape him
 42384	involuntarily: âhe could not understand that there, for the first time,
 42385	we were fighting for Russian soil, and that there was a spirit in the
 42386	men such as I had never seen before, that we had held the French for
 42387	two days, and that that success had increased our strength tenfold. He
 42388	ordered us to retreat, and all our efforts and losses went for nothing.
 42389	He had no thought of betraying us, he tried to do the best he could,
 42390	he thought out everything, and that is why he is unsuitable. He is
 42391	unsuitable now, just because he plans out everything very thoroughly and
 42392	accurately as every German has to. How can I explain?... Well, say your
 42393	father has a German valet, and he is a splendid valet and satisfies your
 42394	fatherâs requirements better than you could, then itâs all right to let
 42395	him serve. But if your father is mortally sick youâll send the valet
 42396	away and attend to your father with your own unpracticed, awkward hands,
 42397	and will soothe him better than a skilled man who is a stranger could.
 42398	So it has been with Barclay. While Russia was well, a foreigner could
 42399	serve her and be a splendid minister; but as soon as she is in danger
 42400	she needs one of her own kin. But in your Club they have been making him
 42401	out a traitor! They slander him as a traitor, and the only result will
 42402	be that afterwards, ashamed of their false accusations, they will make
 42403	him out a hero or a genius instead of a traitor, and that will be still
 42404	more unjust. He is an honest and very punctilious German.â
 42405	
 42406	âAnd they say heâs a skillful commander,â rejoined Pierre.
 42407	
 42408	âI donât understand what is meant by âa skillful commander,ââ replied
 42409	Prince Andrew ironically.
 42410	
 42411	âA skillful commander?â replied Pierre. âWhy, one who foresees all
 42412	contingencies... and foresees the adversaryâs intentions.â
 42413	
 42414	âBut thatâs impossible,â said Prince Andrew as if it were a matter
 42415	settled long ago.
 42416	
 42417	Pierre looked at him in surprise.
 42418	
 42419	âAnd yet they say that war is like a game of chess?â he remarked.
 42420	
 42421	âYes,â replied Prince Andrew, âbut with this little difference, that
 42422	in chess you may think over each move as long as you please and are not
 42423	limited for time, and with this difference too, that a knight is always
 42424	stronger than a pawn, and two pawns are always stronger than one, while
 42425	in war a battalion is sometimes stronger than a division and sometimes
 42426	weaker than a company. The relative strength of bodies of troops can
 42427	never be known to anyone. Believe me,â he went on, âif things
 42428	depended on arrangements made by the staff, I should be there making
 42429	arrangements, but instead of that I have the honor to serve here in
 42430	the regiment with these gentlemen, and I consider that on us tomorrowâs
 42431	battle will depend and not on those others.... Success never depends,
 42432	and never will depend, on position, or equipment, or even on numbers,
 42433	and least of all on position.â
 42434	
 42435	âBut on what then?â
 42436	
 42437	âOn the feeling that is in me and in him,â he pointed to TimÃ³khin, âand
 42438	in each soldier.â
 42439	
 42440	Prince Andrew glanced at TimÃ³khin, who looked at his commander in alarm
 42441	and bewilderment. In contrast to his former reticent taciturnity
 42442	Prince Andrew now seemed excited. He could apparently not refrain from
 42443	expressing the thoughts that had suddenly occurred to him.
 42444	
 42445	âA battle is won by those who firmly resolve to win it! Why did we lose
 42446	the battle at Austerlitz? The French losses were almost equal to ours,
 42447	but very early we said to ourselves that we were losing the battle,
 42448	and we did lose it. And we said so because we had nothing to fight for
 42449	there, we wanted to get away from the battlefield as soon as we could.
 42450	âWeâve lost, so let us run,â and we ran. If we had not said that till
 42451	the evening, heaven knows what might not have happened. But tomorrow we
 42452	shanât say it! You talk about our position, the left flank weak and the
 42453	right flank too extended,â he went on. âThatâs all nonsense, thereâs
 42454	nothing of the kind. But what awaits us tomorrow? A hundred million most
 42455	diverse chances which will be decided on the instant by the fact that
 42456	our men or theirs run or do not run, and that this man or that man is
 42457	killed, but all that is being done at present is only play. The fact is
 42458	that those men with whom you have ridden round the position not only
 42459	do not help matters, but hinder. They are only concerned with their own
 42460	petty interests.â
 42461	
 42462	âAt such a moment?â said Pierre reproachfully.
 42463	
 42464	âAt such a moment!â Prince Andrew repeated. âTo them it is only a moment
 42465	affording opportunities to undermine a rival and obtain an extra cross
 42466	or ribbon. For me tomorrow means this: a Russian army of a hundred
 42467	thousand and a French army of a hundred thousand have met to fight, and
 42468	the thing is that these two hundred thousand men will fight and the side
 42469	that fights more fiercely and spares itself least will win. And if you
 42470	like I will tell you that whatever happens and whatever muddles those at
 42471	the top may make, we shall win tomorrowâs battle. Tomorrow, happen what
 42472	may, we shall win!â
 42473	
 42474	âThere now, your excellency! Thatâs the truth, the real truth,â said
 42475	TimÃ³khin. âWho would spare himself now? The soldiers in my battalion,
 42476	believe me, wouldnât drink their vodka! âItâs not the day for that!â
 42477	they say.â
 42478	
 42479	All were silent. The officers rose. Prince Andrew went out of the shed
 42480	with them, giving final orders to the adjutant. After they had gone
 42481	Pierre approached Prince Andrew and was about to start a conversation
 42482	when they heard the clatter of three horsesâ hoofs on the road not far
 42483	from the shed, and looking in that direction Prince Andrew recognized
 42484	Wolzogen and Clausewitz accompanied by a Cossack. They rode close by
 42485	continuing to converse, and Prince Andrew involuntarily heard these
 42486	words:
 42487	
 42488	âDer Krieg muss in Raum verlegt werden. Der Ansicht kann ich nicht genug
 42489	Preis geben,â * said one of them.
 42490	
 42491	     * âThe war must be extended widely. I cannot sufficiently
 42492	     commend that view.â
 42493	
 42494	
 42495	âOh, ja,â said the other, âder Zweck ist nur den Feind zu schwÃ¤chen,
 42496	so kann man gewiss nicht den Verlust der Privat-Personen in Achtung
 42497	nehmen.â *
 42498	
 42499	     * âOh, yes, the only aim is to weaken the enemy, so of
 42500	     course one cannot take into account the loss of private
 42501	     individuals.â
 42502	
 42503	
 42504	âOh, no,â agreed the other.
 42505	
 42506	âExtend widely!â said Prince Andrew with an angry snort, when they had
 42507	ridden past. âIn that âextendâ were my father, son, and sister, at Bald
 42508	Hills. Thatâs all the same to him! Thatâs what I was saying to youâthose
 42509	German gentlemen wonât win the battle tomorrow but will only make all
 42510	the mess they can, because they have nothing in their German heads but
 42511	theories not worth an empty eggshell and havenât in their hearts the one
 42512	thing needed tomorrowâthat which TimÃ³khin has. They have yielded up all
 42513	Europe to him, and have now come to teach us. Fine teachers!â and again
 42514	his voice grew shrill.
 42515	
 42516	âSo you think we shall win tomorrowâs battle?â asked Pierre.
 42517	
 42518	âYes, yes,â answered Prince Andrew absently. âOne thing I would do if
 42519	I had the power,â he began again, âI would not take prisoners. Why take
 42520	prisoners? Itâs chivalry! The French have destroyed my home and are on
 42521	their way to destroy Moscow, they have outraged and are outraging me
 42522	every moment. They are my enemies. In my opinion they are all criminals.
 42523	And so thinks TimÃ³khin and the whole army. They should be executed!
 42524	Since they are my foes they cannot be my friends, whatever may have been
 42525	said at Tilsit.â
 42526	
 42527	âYes, yes,â muttered Pierre, looking with shining eyes at Prince Andrew.
 42528	âI quite agree with you!â
 42529	
 42530	The question that had perturbed Pierre on the MozhÃ¡ysk hill and all
 42531	that day now seemed to him quite clear and completely solved. He now
 42532	understood the whole meaning and importance of this war and of the
 42533	impending battle. All he had seen that day, all the significant and
 42534	stern expressions on the faces he had seen in passing, were lit up
 42535	for him by a new light. He understood that latent heat (as they say in
 42536	physics) of patriotism which was present in all these men he had seen,
 42537	and this explained to him why they all prepared for death calmly, and as
 42538	it were lightheartedly.
 42539	
 42540	âNot take prisoners,â Prince Andrew continued: âThat by itself would
 42541	quite change the whole war and make it less cruel. As it is we have
 42542	played at warâthatâs whatâs vile! We play at magnanimity and all that
 42543	stuff. Such magnanimity and sensibility are like the magnanimity and
 42544	sensibility of a lady who faints when she sees a calf being killed: she
 42545	is so kindhearted that she canât look at blood, but enjoys eating the
 42546	calf served up with sauce. They talk to us of the rules of war, of
 42547	chivalry, of flags of truce, of mercy to the unfortunate and so on. Itâs
 42548	all rubbish! I saw chivalry and flags of truce in 1805; they humbugged
 42549	us and we humbugged them. They plunder other peopleâs houses, issue
 42550	false paper money, and worst of all they kill my children and my
 42551	father, and then talk of rules of war and magnanimity to foes! Take no
 42552	prisoners, but kill and be killed! He who has come to this as I have
 42553	through the same sufferings...â
 42554	
 42555	Prince Andrew, who had thought it was all the same to him whether or
 42556	not Moscow was taken as SmolÃ©nsk had been, was suddenly checked in his
 42557	speech by an unexpected cramp in his throat. He paced up and down a
 42558	few times in silence, but his eyes glittered feverishly and his lips
 42559	quivered as he began speaking.
 42560	
 42561	âIf there was none of this magnanimity in war, we should go to war only
 42562	when it was worth while going to certain death, as now. Then there would
 42563	not be war because Paul IvÃ¡novich had offended Michael IvÃ¡novich. And
 42564	when there was a war, like this one, it would be war! And then the
 42565	determination of the troops would be quite different. Then all these
 42566	Westphalians and Hessians whom Napoleon is leading would not follow
 42567	him into Russia, and we should not go to fight in Austria and Prussia
 42568	without knowing why. War is not courtesy but the most horrible thing in
 42569	life; and we ought to understand that and not play at war. We ought to
 42570	accept this terrible necessity sternly and seriously. It all lies in
 42571	that: get rid of falsehood and let war be war and not a game. As it is
 42572	now, war is the favorite pastime of the idle and frivolous. The military
 42573	calling is the most highly honored.
 42574	
 42575	âBut what is war? What is needed for success in warfare? What are the
 42576	habits of the military? The aim of war is murder; the methods of war
 42577	are spying, treachery, and their encouragement, the ruin of a countryâs
 42578	inhabitants, robbing them or stealing to provision the army, and fraud
 42579	and falsehood termed military craft. The habits of the military class
 42580	are the absence of freedom, that is, discipline, idleness, ignorance,
 42581	cruelty, debauchery, and drunkenness. And in spite of all this it is the
 42582	highest class, respected by everyone. All the kings, except the Chinese,
 42583	wear military uniforms, and he who kills most people receives the
 42584	highest rewards.
 42585	
 42586	âThey meet, as we shall meet tomorrow, to murder one another; they kill
 42587	and maim tens of thousands, and then have thanksgiving services for
 42588	having killed so many people (they even exaggerate the number), and they
 42589	announce a victory, supposing that the more people they have killed
 42590	the greater their achievement. How does God above look at them and hear
 42591	them?â exclaimed Prince Andrew in a shrill, piercing voice. âAh, my
 42592	friend, it has of late become hard for me to live. I see that I have
 42593	begun to understand too much. And it doesnât do for man to taste of the
 42594	tree of knowledge of good and evil.... Ah, well, itâs not for long!â he
 42595	added.
 42596	
 42597	âHowever, youâre sleepy, and itâs time for me to sleep. Go back to
 42598	GÃ³rki!â said Prince Andrew suddenly.
 42599	
 42600	âOh no!â Pierre replied, looking at Prince Andrew with frightened,
 42601	compassionate eyes.
 42602	
 42603	âGo, go! Before a battle one must have oneâs sleep out,â repeated Prince
 42604	Andrew.
 42605	
 42606	He came quickly up to Pierre and embraced and kissed him. âGood-by, be
 42607	off!â he shouted. âWhether we meet again or not...â and turning away
 42608	hurriedly he entered the shed.
 42609	
 42610	It was already dark, and Pierre could not make out whether the
 42611	expression of Prince Andrewâs face was angry or tender.
 42612	
 42613	For some time he stood in silence considering whether he should follow
 42614	him or go away. âNo, he does not want it!â Pierre concluded. âAnd I know
 42615	that this is our last meeting!â He sighed deeply and rode back to GÃ³rki.
 42616	
 42617	On re-entering the shed Prince Andrew lay down on a rug, but he could
 42618	not sleep.
 42619	
 42620	He closed his eyes. One picture succeeded another in his imagination. On
 42621	one of them he dwelt long and joyfully. He vividly recalled an evening
 42622	in Petersburg. NatÃ¡sha with animated and excited face was telling him
 42623	how she had gone to look for mushrooms the previous summer and had lost
 42624	her way in the big forest. She incoherently described the depths of
 42625	the forest, her feelings, and a talk with a beekeeper she met, and
 42626	constantly interrupted her story to say: âNo, I canât! Iâm not telling
 42627	it right; no, you donât understand,â though he encouraged her by saying
 42628	that he did understand, and he really had understood all she wanted to
 42629	say. But NatÃ¡sha was not satisfied with her own words: she felt that
 42630	they did not convey the passionately poetic feeling she had experienced
 42631	that day and wished to convey. âHe was such a delightful old man, and
 42632	it was so dark in the forest... and he had such kind... No, I canât
 42633	describe it,â she had said, flushed and excited. Prince Andrew smiled
 42634	now the same happy smile as then when he had looked into her eyes. âI
 42635	understood her,â he thought. âI not only understood her, but it was just
 42636	that inner, spiritual force, that sincerity, that frankness of soulâthat
 42637	very soul of hers which seemed to be fettered by her bodyâit was that
 42638	soul I loved in her... loved so strongly and happily...â and suddenly
 42639	he remembered how his love had ended. âHe did not need anything of that
 42640	kind. He neither saw nor understood anything of the sort. He only saw in
 42641	her a pretty and fresh young girl, with whom he did not deign to unite
 42642	his fate. And I?... and he is still alive and gay!â
 42643	
 42644	Prince Andrew jumped up as if someone had burned him, and again began
 42645	pacing up and down in front of the shed.
 42646	
 42647	
 42648	
 42649	
 42650	
 42651	CHAPTER XXVI
 42652	
 42653	On August 25, the eve of the battle of BorodinÃ³, M. de Beausset, prefect
 42654	of the French Emperorâs palace, arrived at Napoleonâs quarters at
 42655	ValÃºevo with Colonel Fabvier, the former from Paris and the latter from
 42656	Madrid.
 42657	
 42658	Donning his court uniform, M. de Beausset ordered a box he had
 42659	brought for the Emperor to be carried before him and entered the first
 42660	compartment of Napoleonâs tent, where he began opening the box while
 42661	conversing with Napoleonâs aides-de-camp who surrounded him.
 42662	
 42663	Fabvier, not entering the tent, remained at the entrance talking to some
 42664	generals of his acquaintance.
 42665	
 42666	The Emperor Napoleon had not yet left his bedroom and was finishing his
 42667	toilet. Slightly snorting and grunting, he presented now his back and
 42668	now his plump hairy chest to the brush with which his valet was rubbing
 42669	him down. Another valet, with his finger over the mouth of a bottle,
 42670	was sprinkling Eau de Cologne on the Emperorâs pampered body with an
 42671	expression which seemed to say that he alone knew where and how much Eau
 42672	de Cologne should be sprinkled. Napoleonâs short hair was wet and
 42673	matted on the forehead, but his face, though puffy and yellow, expressed
 42674	physical satisfaction. âGo on, harder, go on!â he muttered to the valet
 42675	who was rubbing him, slightly twitching and grunting. An aide-de-camp,
 42676	who had entered the bedroom to report to the Emperor the number of
 42677	prisoners taken in yesterdayâs action, was standing by the door after
 42678	delivering his message, awaiting permission to withdraw. Napoleon,
 42679	frowning, looked at him from under his brows.
 42680	
 42681	âNo prisoners!â said he, repeating the aide-de-campâs words. âThey
 42682	are forcing us to exterminate them. So much the worse for the Russian
 42683	army.... Go on... harder, harder!â he muttered, hunching his back and
 42684	presenting his fat shoulders.
 42685	
 42686	âAll right. Let Monsieur de Beausset enter, and Fabvier too,â he said,
 42687	nodding to the aide-de-camp.
 42688	
 42689	âYes, sire,â and the aide-de-camp disappeared through the door of the
 42690	tent.
 42691	
 42692	Two valets rapidly dressed His Majesty, and wearing the blue uniform of
 42693	the Guards he went with firm quick steps to the reception room.
 42694	
 42695	De Beaussetâs hands meanwhile were busily engaged arranging the present
 42696	he had brought from the Empress, on two chairs directly in front of the
 42697	entrance. But Napoleon had dressed and come out with such unexpected
 42698	rapidity that he had not time to finish arranging the surprise.
 42699	
 42700	Napoleon noticed at once what they were about and guessed that they were
 42701	not ready. He did not wish to deprive them of the pleasure of giving him
 42702	a surprise, so he pretended not to see de Beausset and called Fabvier to
 42703	him, listening silently and with a stern frown to what Fabvier told him
 42704	of the heroism and devotion of his troops fighting at Salamanca, at
 42705	the other end of Europe, with but one thoughtâto be worthy of their
 42706	Emperorâand but one fearâto fail to please him. The result of that
 42707	battle had been deplorable. Napoleon made ironic remarks during
 42708	Fabvierâs account, as if he had not expected that matters could go
 42709	otherwise in his absence.
 42710	
 42711	âI must make up for that in Moscow,â said Napoleon. âIâll see you
 42712	later,â he added, and summoned de Beausset, who by that time had
 42713	prepared the surprise, having placed something on the chairs and covered
 42714	it with a cloth.
 42715	
 42716	De Beausset bowed low, with that courtly French bow which only the
 42717	old retainers of the Bourbons knew how to make, and approached him,
 42718	presenting an envelope.
 42719	
 42720	Napoleon turned to him gaily and pulled his ear.
 42721	
 42722	âYou have hurried here. I am very glad. Well, what is Paris saying?â he
 42723	asked, suddenly changing his former stern expression for a most cordial
 42724	tone.
 42725	
 42726	âSire, all Paris regrets your absence,â replied de Beausset as was
 42727	proper.
 42728	
 42729	But though Napoleon knew that de Beausset had to say something of this
 42730	kind, and though in his lucid moments he knew it was untrue, he was
 42731	pleased to hear it from him. Again he honored him by touching his ear.
 42732	
 42733	âI am very sorry to have made you travel so far,â said he.
 42734	
 42735	âSire, I expected nothing less than to find you at the gates of Moscow,â
 42736	replied de Beausset.
 42737	
 42738	Napoleon smiled and, lifting his head absent-mindedly, glanced to the
 42739	right. An aide-de-camp approached with gliding steps and offered him a
 42740	gold snuffbox, which he took.
 42741	
 42742	âYes, it has happened luckily for you,â he said, raising the open
 42743	snuffbox to his nose. âYou are fond of travel, and in three days you
 42744	will see Moscow. You surely did not expect to see that Asiatic capital.
 42745	You will have a pleasant journey.â
 42746	
 42747	De Beausset bowed gratefully at this regard for his taste for travel (of
 42748	which he had not till then been aware).
 42749	
 42750	âHa, whatâs this?â asked Napoleon, noticing that all the courtiers were
 42751	looking at something concealed under a cloth.
 42752	
 42753	With courtly adroitness de Beausset half turned and without turning his
 42754	back to the Emperor retired two steps, twitching off the cloth at the
 42755	same time, and said:
 42756	
 42757	âA present to Your Majesty from the Empress.â
 42758	
 42759	It was a portrait, painted in bright colors by GÃ©rard, of the son borne
 42760	to Napoleon by the daughter of the Emperor of Austria, the boy whom for
 42761	some reason everyone called âThe King of Rome.â
 42762	
 42763	A very pretty curly-headed boy with a look of the Christ in the Sistine
 42764	Madonna was depicted playing at stick and ball. The ball represented the
 42765	terrestrial globe and the stick in his other hand a scepter.
 42766	
 42767	Though it was not clear what the artist meant to express by depicting
 42768	the so-called King of Rome spiking the earth with a stick, the allegory
 42769	apparently seemed to Napoleon, as it had done to all who had seen it in
 42770	Paris, quite clear and very pleasing.
 42771	
 42772	âThe King of Rome!â he said, pointing to the portrait with a graceful
 42773	gesture. âAdmirable!â
 42774	
 42775	With the natural capacity of an Italian for changing the expression of
 42776	his face at will, he drew nearer to the portrait and assumed a look
 42777	of pensive tenderness. He felt that what he now said and did would be
 42778	historical, and it seemed to him that it would now be best for himâwhose
 42779	grandeur enabled his son to play stick and ball with the terrestrial
 42780	globeâto show, in contrast to that grandeur, the simplest paternal
 42781	tenderness. His eyes grew dim, he moved forward, glanced round at a
 42782	chair (which seemed to place itself under him), and sat down on it
 42783	before the portrait. At a single gesture from him everyone went out on
 42784	tiptoe, leaving the great man to himself and his emotion.
 42785	
 42786	Having sat still for a while he touchedâhimself not knowing whyâthe
 42787	thick spot of paint representing the highest light in the portrait,
 42788	rose, and recalled de Beausset and the officer on duty. He ordered the
 42789	portrait to be carried outside his tent, that the Old Guard, stationed
 42790	round it, might not be deprived of the pleasure of seeing the King of
 42791	Rome, the son and heir of their adored monarch.
 42792	
 42793	And while he was doing M. de Beausset the honor of breakfasting with
 42794	him, they heard, as Napoleon had anticipated, the rapturous cries of the
 42795	officers and men of the Old Guard who had run up to see the portrait.
 42796	
 42797	âVive lâEmpereur! Vive le roi de Rome! Vive lâEmpereur!â came those
 42798	ecstatic cries.
 42799	
 42800	After breakfast Napoleon in de Beaussetâs presence dictated his order of
 42801	the day to the army.
 42802	
 42803	âShort and energetic!â he remarked when he had read over the
 42804	proclamation which he had dictated straight off without corrections. It
 42805	ran:
 42806	
 42807	Soldiers! This is the battle you have so longed for. Victory depends on
 42808	you. It is essential for us; it will give us all we need: comfortable
 42809	quarters and a speedy return to our country. Behave as you did at
 42810	Austerlitz, Friedland, VÃ­tebsk, and SmolÃ©nsk. Let our remotest posterity
 42811	recall your achievements this day with pride. Let it be said of each of
 42812	you: âHe was in the great battle before Moscow!â
 42813	
 42814	âBefore Moscow!â repeated Napoleon, and inviting M. de Beausset, who was
 42815	so fond of travel, to accompany him on his ride, he went out of the tent
 42816	to where the horses stood saddled.
 42817	
 42818	âYour Majesty is too kind!â replied de Beausset to the invitation to
 42819	accompany the Emperor; he wanted to sleep, did not know how to ride and
 42820	was afraid of doing so.
 42821	
 42822	But Napoleon nodded to the traveler, and de Beausset had to mount. When
 42823	Napoleon came out of the tent the shouting of the Guards before his
 42824	sonâs portrait grew still louder. Napoleon frowned.
 42825	
 42826	âTake him away!â he said, pointing with a gracefully majestic gesture to
 42827	the portrait. âIt is too soon for him to see a field of battle.â
 42828	
 42829	De Beausset closed his eyes, bowed his head, and sighed deeply, to
 42830	indicate how profoundly he valued and comprehended the Emperorâs words.
 42831	
 42832	
 42833	
 42834	
 42835	
 42836	CHAPTER XXVII
 42837	
 42838	On the twenty-fifth of August, so his historians tell us, Napoleon spent
 42839	the whole day on horseback inspecting the locality, considering plans
 42840	submitted to him by his marshals, and personally giving commands to his
 42841	generals.
 42842	
 42843	The original line of the Russian forces along the river KolochÃ¡ had
 42844	been dislocated by the capture of the ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubt on the
 42845	twenty-fourth, and part of the lineâthe left flankâhad been drawn back.
 42846	That part of the line was not entrenched and in front of it the ground
 42847	was more open and level than elsewhere. It was evident to anyone,
 42848	military or not, that it was here the French should attack. It would
 42849	seem that not much consideration was needed to reach this conclusion,
 42850	nor any particular care or trouble on the part of the Emperor and his
 42851	marshals, nor was there any need of that special and supreme quality
 42852	called genius that people are so apt to ascribe to Napoleon; yet the
 42853	historians who described the event later and the men who then surrounded
 42854	Napoleon, and he himself, thought otherwise.
 42855	
 42856	Napoleon rode over the plain and surveyed the locality with a profound
 42857	air and in silence, nodded with approval or shook his head dubiously,
 42858	and without communicating to the generals around him the profound
 42859	course of ideas which guided his decisions merely gave them his final
 42860	conclusions in the form of commands. Having listened to a suggestion
 42861	from Davout, who was now called Prince dâEckmÃ¼hl, to turn the Russian
 42862	left wing, Napoleon said it should not be done, without explaining
 42863	why not. To a proposal made by General Campan (who was to attack the
 42864	flÃ¨ches) to lead his division through the woods, Napoleon agreed, though
 42865	the so-called Duke of Elchingen (Ney) ventured to remark that a movement
 42866	through the woods was dangerous and might disorder the division.
 42867	
 42868	Having inspected the country opposite the ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubt, Napoleon
 42869	pondered a little in silence and then indicated the spots where two
 42870	batteries should be set up by the morrow to act against the Russian
 42871	entrenchments, and the places where, in line with them, the field
 42872	artillery should be placed.
 42873	
 42874	After giving these and other commands he returned to his tent, and the
 42875	dispositions for the battle were written down from his dictation.
 42876	
 42877	These dispositions, of which the French historians write with enthusiasm
 42878	and other historians with profound respect, were as follows:
 42879	
 42880	At dawn the two new batteries established during the night on the
 42881	plain occupied by the Prince dâEckmÃ¼hl will open fire on the opposing
 42882	batteries of the enemy.
 42883	
 42884	At the same time the commander of the artillery of the 1st Corps,
 42885	General Pernetti, with thirty cannon of Campanâs division and all the
 42886	howitzers of Dessaixâs and Friantâs divisions, will move forward, open
 42887	fire, and overwhelm with shellfire the enemyâs battery, against which
 42888	will operate:
 42889	
 42890	        24 guns of the artillery of the Guards
 42891	        30 guns of Campanâs division
 42892	
 42893	 and     8 guns of Friantâs and Dessaixâs divisions
 42894	        â
 42895	
 42896	 in all 62 guns.
 42897	
 42898	The commander of the artillery of the 3rd Corps, General FouchÃ©, will
 42899	place the howitzers of the 3rd and 8th Corps, sixteen in all, on the
 42900	flanks of the battery that is to bombard the entrenchment on the left,
 42901	which will have forty guns in all directed against it.
 42902	
 42903	General Sorbier must be ready at the first order to advance with all the
 42904	howitzers of the Guardâs artillery against either one or other of the
 42905	entrenchments.
 42906	
 42907	During the cannonade Prince Poniatowski is to advance through the wood
 42908	on the village and turn the enemyâs position.
 42909	
 42910	General Campan will move through the wood to seize the first
 42911	fortification.
 42912	
 42913	After the advance has begun in this manner, orders will be given in
 42914	accordance with the enemyâs movements.
 42915	
 42916	The cannonade on the left flank will begin as soon as the guns of the
 42917	right wing are heard. The sharpshooters of Morandâs division and of
 42918	the vice-Kingâs division will open a heavy fire on seeing the attack
 42919	commence on the right wing.
 42920	
 42921	The vice-King will occupy the village and cross by its three bridges,
 42922	advancing to the same heights as Morandâs and Gibrardâs divisions, which
 42923	under his leadership will be directed against the redoubt and come into
 42924	line with the rest of the forces.
 42925	
 42926	All this must be done in good order (le tout se fera avec ordre et
 42927	mÃ©thode) as far as possible retaining troops in reserve.
 42928	
 42929	The Imperial Camp near MozhÃ¡ysk,
 42930	
 42931	September, 6, 1812.
 42932	
 42933	
 42934	These dispositions, which are very obscure and confused if one allows
 42935	oneself to regard the arrangements without religious awe of his genius,
 42936	related to Napoleonâs orders to deal with four pointsâfour different
 42937	orders. Not one of these was, or could be, carried out.
 42938	
 42939	In the disposition it is said first that the batteries placed on the
 42940	spot chosen by Napoleon, with the guns of Pernetti and FouchÃ©; which
 42941	were to come in line with them, 102 guns in all, were to open fire and
 42942	shower shells on the Russian flÃ¨ches and redoubts. This could not be
 42943	done, as from the spots selected by Napoleon the projectiles did not
 42944	carry to the Russian works, and those 102 guns shot into the air until
 42945	the nearest commander, contrary to Napoleonâs instructions, moved them
 42946	forward.
 42947	
 42948	The second order was that Poniatowski, moving to the village through the
 42949	wood, should turn the Russian left flank. This could not be done and
 42950	was not done, because Poniatowski, advancing on the village through the
 42951	wood, met TÃºchkov there barring his way, and could not and did not turn
 42952	the Russian position.
 42953	
 42954	The third order was: General Campan will move through the wood to seize
 42955	the first fortification. General Campanâs division did not seize the
 42956	first fortification but was driven back, for on emerging from the wood
 42957	it had to reform under grapeshot, of which Napoleon was unaware.
 42958	
 42959	The fourth order was: The vice-King will occupy the village (BorodinÃ³)
 42960	and cross by its three bridges, advancing to the same heights as
 42961	Morandâs and GÃ©rardâs divisions (for whose movements no directions are
 42962	given), which under his leadership will be directed against the redoubt
 42963	and come into line with the rest of the forces.
 42964	
 42965	As far as one can make out, not so much from this unintelligible
 42966	sentence as from the attempts the vice-King made to execute the orders
 42967	given him, he was to advance from the left through BorodinÃ³ to the
 42968	redoubt while the divisions of Morand and GÃ©rard were to advance
 42969	simultaneously from the front.
 42970	
 42971	All this, like the other parts of the disposition, was not and could
 42972	not be executed. After passing through BorodinÃ³ the vice-King was driven
 42973	back to the KolochÃ¡ and could get no farther; while the divisions of
 42974	Morand and GÃ©rard did not take the redoubt but were driven back, and the
 42975	redoubt was only taken at the end of the battle by the cavalry (a thing
 42976	probably unforeseen and not heard of by Napoleon). So not one of
 42977	the orders in the disposition was, or could be, executed. But in the
 42978	disposition it is said that, after the fight has commenced in this
 42979	manner, orders will be given in accordance with the enemyâs movements,
 42980	and so it might be supposed that all necessary arrangements would be
 42981	made by Napoleon during the battle. But this was not and could not be
 42982	done, for during the whole battle Napoleon was so far away that, as
 42983	appeared later, he could not know the course of the battle and not one
 42984	of his orders during the fight could be executed.
 42985

 42990	CHAPTER XXVIII
 42991	
 42992	Many historians say that the French did not win the battle of BorodinÃ³
 42993	because Napoleon had a cold, and that if he had not had a cold the
 42994	orders he gave before and during the battle would have been still more
 42995	full of genius and Russia would have been lost and the face of the world
 42996	have been changed. To historians who believe that Russia was shaped
 42997	by the will of one manâPeter the Greatâand that France from a republic
 42998	became an empire and French armies went to Russia at the will of one
 42999	manâNapoleonâto say that Russia remained a power because Napoleon had a
 43000	bad cold on the twenty-fourth of August may seem logical and convincing.
 43001	
 43002	If it had depended on Napoleonâs will to fight or not to fight the
 43003	battle of BorodinÃ³, and if this or that other arrangement depended on
 43004	his will, then evidently a cold affecting the manifestation of his will
 43005	might have saved Russia, and consequently the valet who omitted to bring
 43006	Napoleon his waterproof boots on the twenty-fourth would have been
 43007	the savior of Russia. Along that line of thought such a deduction is
 43008	indubitable, as indubitable as the deduction Voltaire made in jest
 43009	(without knowing what he was jesting at) when he saw that the Massacre
 43010	of St. Bartholomew was due to Charles IXâs stomach being deranged. But
 43011	to men who do not admit that Russia was formed by the will of one man,
 43012	Peter I, or that the French Empire was formed and the war with Russia
 43013	begun by the will of one man, Napoleon, that argument seems not merely
 43014	untrue and irrational, but contrary to all human reality. To the
 43015	question of what causes historic events another answer presents itself,
 43016	namely, that the course of human events is predetermined from on
 43017	highâdepends on the coincidence of the wills of all who take part in the
 43018	events, and that a Napoleonâs influence on the course of these events is
 43019	purely external and fictitious.
 43020	
 43021	Strange as at first glance it may seem to suppose that the Massacre of
 43022	St. Bartholomew was not due to Charles IXâs will, though he gave the
 43023	order for it and thought it was done as a result of that order; and
 43024	strange as it may seem to suppose that the slaughter of eighty thousand
 43025	men at BorodinÃ³ was not due to Napoleonâs will, though he ordered the
 43026	commencement and conduct of the battle and thought it was done
 43027	because he ordered it; strange as these suppositions appear, yet human
 43028	dignityâwhich tells me that each of us is, if not more at least not less
 43029	a man than the great Napoleonâdemands the acceptance of that solution of
 43030	the question, and historic investigation abundantly confirms it.
 43031	
 43032	At the battle of BorodinÃ³ Napoleon shot at no one and killed no one.
 43033	That was all done by the soldiers. Therefore it was not he who killed
 43034	people.
 43035	
 43036	The French soldiers went to kill and be killed at the battle of BorodinÃ³
 43037	not because of Napoleonâs orders but by their own volition. The whole
 43038	armyâFrench, Italian, German, Polish, and Dutchâhungry, ragged, and
 43039	weary of the campaign, felt at the sight of an army blocking their road
 43040	to Moscow that the wine was drawn and must be drunk. Had Napoleon then
 43041	forbidden them to fight the Russians, they would have killed him and
 43042	have proceeded to fight the Russians because it was inevitable.
 43043	
 43044	When they heard Napoleonâs proclamation offering them, as compensation
 43045	for mutilation and death, the words of posterity about their having been
 43046	in the battle before Moscow, they cried âVive lâEmpereur!â just as they
 43047	had cried âVive lâEmpereur!â at the sight of the portrait of the boy
 43048	piercing the terrestrial globe with a toy stick, and just as they would
 43049	have cried âVive lâEmpereur!â at any nonsense that might be told them.
 43050	There was nothing left for them to do but cry âVive lâEmpereur!â and go
 43051	to fight, in order to get food and rest as conquerors in Moscow. So it
 43052	was not because of Napoleonâs commands that they killed their fellow
 43053	men.
 43054	
 43055	And it was not Napoleon who directed the course of the battle, for none
 43056	of his orders were executed and during the battle he did not know what
 43057	was going on before him. So the way in which these people killed one
 43058	another was not decided by Napoleonâs will but occurred independently of
 43059	him, in accord with the will of hundreds of thousands of people who took
 43060	part in the common action. It only seemed to Napoleon that it all took
 43061	place by his will. And so the question whether he had or had not a
 43062	cold has no more historic interest than the cold of the least of the
 43063	transport soldiers.
 43064	
 43065	Moreover, the assertion made by various writers that his cold was
 43066	the cause of his dispositions not being as well-planned as on former
 43067	occasions, and of his orders during the battle not being as good as
 43068	previously, is quite baseless, which again shows that Napoleonâs cold on
 43069	the twenty-sixth of August was unimportant.
 43070	
 43071	The dispositions cited above are not at all worse, but are even
 43072	better, than previous dispositions by which he had won victories. His
 43073	pseudo-orders during the battle were also no worse than formerly, but
 43074	much the same as usual. These dispositions and orders only seem worse
 43075	than previous ones because the battle of BorodinÃ³ was the first Napoleon
 43076	did not win. The profoundest and most excellent dispositions and orders
 43077	seem very bad, and every learned militarist criticizes them with looks
 43078	of importance, when they relate to a battle that has been lost, and the
 43079	very worst dispositions and orders seem very good, and serious people
 43080	fill whole volumes to demonstrate their merits, when they relate to a
 43081	battle that has been won.
 43082	
 43083	The dispositions drawn up by Weyrother for the battle of Austerlitz were
 43084	a model of perfection for that kind of composition, but still they were
 43085	criticizedâcriticized for their very perfection, for their excessive
 43086	minuteness.
 43087	
 43088	Napoleon at the battle of BorodinÃ³ fulfilled his office as
 43089	representative of authority as well as, and even better than, at other
 43090	battles. He did nothing harmful to the progress of the battle; he
 43091	inclined to the most reasonable opinions, he made no confusion, did not
 43092	contradict himself, did not get frightened or run away from the field of
 43093	battle, but with his great tact and military experience carried out his
 43094	role of appearing to command, calmly and with dignity.
 43095	
 43096	
 43097	
 43098	
 43099	
 43100	CHAPTER XXIX
 43101	
 43102	On returning from a second inspection of the lines, Napoleon remarked:
 43103	
 43104	âThe chessmen are set up, the game will begin tomorrow!â
 43105	
 43106	Having ordered punch and summoned de Beausset, he began to talk to him
 43107	about Paris and about some changes he meant to make in the Empressâ
 43108	household, surprising the prefect by his memory of minute details
 43109	relating to the court.
 43110	
 43111	He showed an interest in trifles, joked about de Beaussetâs love of
 43112	travel, and chatted carelessly, as a famous, self-confident surgeon who
 43113	knows his job does when turning up his sleeves and putting on his apron
 43114	while a patient is being strapped to the operating table. âThe matter is
 43115	in my hands and is clear and definite in my head. When the time comes to
 43116	set to work I shall do it as no one else could, but now I can jest, and
 43117	the more I jest and the calmer I am the more tranquil and confident you
 43118	ought to be, and the more amazed at my genius.â
 43119	
 43120	Having finished his second glass of punch, Napoleon went to rest before
 43121	the serious business which, he considered, awaited him next day. He
 43122	was so much interested in that task that he was unable to sleep, and
 43123	in spite of his cold which had grown worse from the dampness of the
 43124	evening, he went into the large division of the tent at three oâclock in
 43125	the morning, loudly blowing his nose. He asked whether the Russians had
 43126	not withdrawn, and was told that the enemyâs fires were still in the
 43127	same places. He nodded approval.
 43128	
 43129	The adjutant in attendance came into the tent.
 43130	
 43131	âWell, Rapp, do you think we shall do good business today?â Napoleon
 43132	asked him.
 43133	
 43134	âWithout doubt, sire,â replied Rapp.
 43135	
 43136	Napoleon looked at him.
 43137	
 43138	âDo you remember, sire, what you did me the honor to say at SmolÃ©nsk?â
 43139	continued Rapp. âThe wine is drawn and must be drunk.â
 43140	
 43141	Napoleon frowned and sat silent for a long time leaning his head on his
 43142	hand.
 43143	
 43144	âThis poor army!â he suddenly remarked. âIt has diminished greatly since
 43145	SmolÃ©nsk. Fortune is frankly a courtesan, Rapp. I have always said so
 43146	and I am beginning to experience it. But the Guards, Rapp, the Guards
 43147	are intact?â he remarked interrogatively.
 43148	
 43149	âYes, sire,â replied Rapp.
 43150	
 43151	Napoleon took a lozenge, put it in his mouth, and glanced at his watch.
 43152	He was not sleepy and it was still not nearly morning. It was impossible
 43153	to give further orders for the sake of killing time, for the orders had
 43154	all been given and were now being executed.
 43155	
 43156	âHave the biscuits and rice been served out to the regiments of the
 43157	Guards?â asked Napoleon sternly.
 43158	
 43159	âYes, sire.â
 43160	
 43161	âThe rice too?â
 43162	
 43163	Rapp replied that he had given the Emperorâs order about the rice, but
 43164	Napoleon shook his head in dissatisfaction as if not believing that
 43165	his order had been executed. An attendant came in with punch. Napoleon
 43166	ordered another glass to be brought for Rapp, and silently sipped his
 43167	own.
 43168	
 43169	âI have neither taste nor smell,â he remarked, sniffing at his glass.
 43170	âThis cold is tiresome. They talk about medicineâwhat is the good of
 43171	medicine when it canât cure a cold! Corvisart gave me these lozenges but
 43172	they donât help at all. What can doctors cure? One canât cure anything.
 43173	Our body is a machine for living. It is organized for that, it is its
 43174	nature. Let life go on in it unhindered and let it defend itself, it
 43175	will do more than if you paralyze it by encumbering it with remedies.
 43176	Our body is like a perfect watch that should go for a certain time; the
 43177	watchmaker cannot open it, he can only adjust it by fumbling, and that
 43178	blindfold.... Yes, our body is just a machine for living, that is all.â
 43179	
 43180	And having entered on the path of definition, of which he was fond,
 43181	Napoleon suddenly and unexpectedly gave a new one.
 43182	
 43183	âDo you know, Rapp, what military art is?â asked he. âIt is the art of
 43184	being stronger than the enemy at a given moment. Thatâs all.â
 43185	
 43186	Rapp made no reply.
 43187	
 43188	âTomorrow we shall have to deal with KutÃºzov!â said Napoleon. âWe shall
 43189	see! Do you remember at Braunau he commanded an army for three weeks
 43190	and did not once mount a horse to inspect his entrenchments.... We shall
 43191	see!â
 43192	
 43193	He looked at his watch. It was still only four oâclock. He did not feel
 43194	sleepy. The punch was finished and there was still nothing to do. He
 43195	rose, walked to and fro, put on a warm overcoat and a hat, and went
 43196	out of the tent. The night was dark and damp, a scarcely perceptible
 43197	moisture was descending from above. Near by, the campfires were dimly
 43198	burning among the French Guards, and in the distance those of the
 43199	Russian line shone through the smoke. The weather was calm, and the
 43200	rustle and tramp of the French troops already beginning to move to take
 43201	up their positions were clearly audible.
 43202	
 43203	Napoleon walked about in front of his tent, looked at the fires and
 43204	listened to these sounds, and as he was passing a tall guardsman in
 43205	a shaggy cap, who was standing sentinel before his tent and had drawn
 43206	himself up like a black pillar at sight of the Emperor, Napoleon stopped
 43207	in front of him.
 43208	
 43209	âWhat year did you enter the service?â he asked with that affectation
 43210	of military bluntness and geniality with which he always addressed the
 43211	soldiers.
 43212	
 43213	The man answered the question.
 43214	
 43215	âAh! One of the old ones! Has your regiment had its rice?â
 43216	
 43217	âIt has, Your Majesty.â
 43218	
 43219	Napoleon nodded and walked away.
 43220	
 43221	
 43222	At half-past five Napoleon rode to the village of ShevÃ¡rdino.
 43223	
 43224	It was growing light, the sky was clearing, only a single cloud lay in
 43225	the east. The abandoned campfires were burning themselves out in the
 43226	faint morning light.
 43227	
 43228	On the right a single deep report of a cannon resounded and died away in
 43229	the prevailing silence. Some minutes passed. A second and a third report
 43230	shook the air, then a fourth and a fifth boomed solemnly near by on the
 43231	right.
 43232	
 43233	The first shots had not yet ceased to reverberate before others rang out
 43234	and yet more were heard mingling with and overtaking one another.
 43235	
 43236	Napoleon with his suite rode up to the ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubt where he
 43237	dismounted. The game had begun.
 43238	
 43239	
 43240	
 43241	
 43242	
 43243	CHAPTER XXX
 43244	
 43245	On returning to GÃ³rki after having seen Prince Andrew, Pierre ordered
 43246	his groom to get the horses ready and to call him early in the morning,
 43247	and then immediately fell asleep behind a partition in a corner BorÃ­s
 43248	had given up to him.
 43249	
 43250	Before he was thoroughly awake next morning everybody had already left
 43251	the hut. The panes were rattling in the little windows and his groom was
 43252	shaking him.
 43253	
 43254	âYour excellency! Your excellency! Your excellency!â he kept repeating
 43255	pertinaciously while he shook Pierre by the shoulder without looking at
 43256	him, having apparently lost hope of getting him to wake up.
 43257	
 43258	âWhat? Has it begun? Is it time?â Pierre asked, waking up.
 43259	
 43260	âHear the firing,â said the groom, a discharged soldier. âAll the
 43261	gentlemen have gone out, and his Serene Highness himself rode past long
 43262	ago.â
 43263	
 43264	Pierre dressed hastily and ran out to the porch. Outside all was bright,
 43265	fresh, dewy, and cheerful. The sun, just bursting forth from behind a
 43266	cloud that had concealed it, was shining, with rays still half broken
 43267	by the clouds, over the roofs of the street opposite, on the
 43268	dew-besprinkled dust of the road, on the walls of the houses, on the
 43269	windows, the fence, and on Pierreâs horses standing before the hut. The
 43270	roar of guns sounded more distinct outside. An adjutant accompanied by a
 43271	Cossack passed by at a sharp trot.
 43272	
 43273	âItâs time, Count; itâs time!â cried the adjutant.
 43274	
 43275	Telling the groom to follow him with the horses, Pierre went down the
 43276	street to the knoll from which he had looked at the field of battle the
 43277	day before. A crowd of military men was assembled there, members of the
 43278	staff could be heard conversing in French, and KutÃºzovâs gray head in
 43279	a white cap with a red band was visible, his gray nape sunk between his
 43280	shoulders. He was looking through a field glass down the highroad before
 43281	him.
 43282	
 43283	Mounting the steps to the knoll Pierre looked at the scene before him,
 43284	spellbound by beauty. It was the same panorama he had admired from that
 43285	spot the day before, but now the whole place was full of troops and
 43286	covered by smoke clouds from the guns, and the slanting rays of the
 43287	bright sun, rising slightly to the left behind Pierre, cast upon it
 43288	through the clear morning air penetrating streaks of rosy, golden-tinted
 43289	light and long dark shadows. The forest at the farthest extremity of
 43290	the panorama seemed carved in some precious stone of a yellowish-green
 43291	color; its undulating outline was silhouetted against the horizon and
 43292	was pierced beyond ValÃºevo by the SmolÃ©nsk highroad crowded with troops.
 43293	Nearer at hand glittered golden cornfields interspersed with copses.
 43294	There were troops to be seen everywhere, in front and to the right and
 43295	left. All this was vivid, majestic, and unexpected; but what impressed
 43296	Pierre most of all was the view of the battlefield itself, of BorodinÃ³
 43297	and the hollows on both sides of the KolochÃ¡.
 43298	
 43299	Above the KolochÃ¡, in BorodinÃ³ and on both sides of it, especially to
 43300	the left where the VÃ³yna flowing between its marshy banks falls into
 43301	the KolochÃ¡, a mist had spread which seemed to melt, to dissolve, and to
 43302	become translucent when the brilliant sun appeared and magically colored
 43303	and outlined everything. The smoke of the guns mingled with this mist,
 43304	and over the whole expanse and through that mist the rays of the morning
 43305	sun were reflected, flashing back like lightning from the water, from
 43306	the dew, and from the bayonets of the troops crowded together by the
 43307	riverbanks and in BorodinÃ³. A white church could be seen through the
 43308	mist, and here and there the roofs of huts in BorodinÃ³ as well as dense
 43309	masses of soldiers, or green ammunition chests and ordnance. And all
 43310	this moved, or seemed to move, as the smoke and mist spread out over
 43311	the whole space. Just as in the mist-enveloped hollow near BorodinÃ³, so
 43312	along the entire line outside and above it and especially in the woods
 43313	and fields to the left, in the valleys and on the summits of the high
 43314	ground, clouds of powder smoke seemed continually to spring up out of
 43315	nothing, now singly, now several at a time, some translucent, others
 43316	dense, which, swelling, growing, rolling, and blending, extended over
 43317	the whole expanse.
 43318	
 43319	These puffs of smoke and (strange to say) the sound of the firing
 43320	produced the chief beauty of the spectacle.
 43321	
 43322	âPuff!ââsuddenly a round compact cloud of smoke was seen merging from
 43323	violet into gray and milky white, and âboom!â came the report a second
 43324	later.
 43325	
 43326	âPuff! puff!ââand two clouds arose pushing one another and blending
 43327	together; and âboom, boom!â came the sounds confirming what the eye had
 43328	seen.
 43329	
 43330	Pierre glanced round at the first cloud, which he had seen as a round
 43331	compact ball, and in its place already were balloons of smoke floating
 43332	to one side, andââpuffâ (with a pause)ââpuff, puff!â three and then four
 43333	more appeared and then from each, with the same intervalââboomâboom,
 43334	boom!â came the fine, firm, precise sounds in reply. It seemed as if
 43335	those smoke clouds sometimes ran and sometimes stood still while woods,
 43336	fields, and glittering bayonets ran past them. From the left, over
 43337	fields and bushes, those large balls of smoke were continually appearing
 43338	followed by their solemn reports, while nearer still, in the hollows and
 43339	woods, there burst from the muskets small cloudlets that had no time
 43340	to become balls, but had their little echoes in just the same way.
 43341	âTrakh-ta-ta-takh!â came the frequent crackle of musketry, but it was
 43342	irregular and feeble in comparison with the reports of the cannon.
 43343	
 43344	Pierre wished to be there with that smoke, those shining bayonets, that
 43345	movement, and those sounds. He turned to look at KutÃºzov and his suite,
 43346	to compare his impressions with those of others. They were all looking
 43347	at the field of battle as he was, and, as it seemed to him, with the
 43348	same feelings. All their faces were now shining with that latent warmth
 43349	of feeling Pierre had noticed the day before and had fully understood
 43350	after his talk with Prince Andrew.
 43351	
 43352	âGo, my dear fellow, go... and Christ be with you!â KutÃºzov was
 43353	saying to a general who stood beside him, not taking his eye from the
 43354	battlefield.
 43355	
 43356	Having received this order the general passed by Pierre on his way down
 43357	the knoll.
 43358	
 43359	âTo the crossing!â said the general coldly and sternly in reply to one
 43360	of the staff who asked where he was going.
 43361	
 43362	âIâll go there too, I too!â thought Pierre, and followed the general.
 43363	
 43364	The general mounted a horse a Cossack had brought him. Pierre went to
 43365	his groom who was holding his horses and, asking which was the quietest,
 43366	clambered onto it, seized it by the mane, and turning out his toes
 43367	pressed his heels against its sides and, feeling that his spectacles
 43368	were slipping off but unable to let go of the mane and reins, he
 43369	galloped after the general, causing the staff officers to smile as they
 43370	watched him from the knoll.
 43371	
 43372

 43375	
 43376	CHAPTER XXXI
 43377	
 43378	Having descended the hill the general after whom Pierre was galloping
 43379	turned sharply to the left, and Pierre, losing sight of him, galloped
 43380	in among some ranks of infantry marching ahead of him. He tried to pass
 43381	either in front of them or to the right or left, but there were soldiers
 43382	everywhere, all with the same preoccupied expression and busy with
 43383	some unseen but evidently important task. They all gazed with the same
 43384	dissatisfied and inquiring expression at this stout man in a white hat,
 43385	who for some unknown reason threatened to trample them under his horseâs
 43386	hoofs.
 43387	
 43388	âWhy ride into the middle of the battalion?â one of them shouted at him.
 43389	
 43390	Another prodded his horse with the butt end of a musket, and Pierre,
 43391	bending over his saddlebow and hardly able to control his shying horse,
 43392	galloped ahead of the soldiers where there was a free space.
 43393	
 43394	There was a bridge ahead of him, where other soldiers stood firing.
 43395	Pierre rode up to them. Without being aware of it he had come to the
 43396	bridge across the KolochÃ¡ between GÃ³rki and BorodinÃ³, which the French
 43397	(having occupied BorodinÃ³) were attacking in the first phase of the
 43398	battle. Pierre saw that there was a bridge in front of him and that
 43399	soldiers were doing something on both sides of it and in the meadow,
 43400	among the rows of new-mown hay which he had taken no notice of amid the
 43401	smoke of the campfires the day before; but despite the incessant firing
 43402	going on there he had no idea that this was the field of battle. He did
 43403	not notice the sound of the bullets whistling from every side, or the
 43404	projectiles that flew over him, did not see the enemy on the other side
 43405	of the river, and for a long time did not notice the killed and wounded,
 43406	though many fell near him. He looked about him with a smile which did
 43407	not leave his face.
 43408	
 43409	âWhyâs that fellow in front of the line?â shouted somebody at him again.
 43410	
 43411	âTo the left!... Keep to the right!â the men shouted to him.
 43412	
 43413	Pierre went to the right, and unexpectedly encountered one of RaÃ©vskiâs
 43414	adjutants whom he knew. The adjutant looked angrily at him, evidently
 43415	also intending to shout at him, but on recognizing him he nodded.
 43416	
 43417	âHow have you got here?â he said, and galloped on.
 43418	
 43419	Pierre, feeling out of place there, having nothing to do, and afraid of
 43420	getting in someoneâs way again, galloped after the adjutant.
 43421	
 43422	âWhatâs happening here? May I come with you?â he asked.
 43423	
 43424	âOne moment, one moment!â replied the adjutant, and riding up to a stout
 43425	colonel who was standing in the meadow, he gave him some message and
 43426	then addressed Pierre.
 43427	
 43428	âWhy have you come here, Count?â he asked with a smile. âStill
 43429	inquisitive?â
 43430	
 43431	âYes, yes,â assented Pierre.
 43432	
 43433	But the adjutant turned his horse about and rode on.
 43434	
 43435	âHere itâs tolerable,â said he, âbut with BagratiÃ³n on the left flank
 43436	theyâre getting it frightfully hot.â
 43437	
 43438	âReally?â said Pierre. âWhere is that?â
 43439	
 43440	âCome along with me to our knoll. We can get a view from there and in
 43441	our battery it is still bearable,â said the adjutant. âWill you come?â
 43442	
 43443	âYes, Iâll come with you,â replied Pierre, looking round for his groom.
 43444	
 43445	It was only now that he noticed wounded men staggering along or being
 43446	carried on stretchers. On that very meadow he had ridden over the day
 43447	before, a soldier was lying athwart the rows of scented hay, with his
 43448	head thrown awkwardly back and his shako off.
 43449	
 43450	âWhy havenât they carried him away?â Pierre was about to ask, but seeing
 43451	the stern expression of the adjutant who was also looking that way, he
 43452	checked himself.
 43453	
 43454	Pierre did not find his groom and rode along the hollow with the
 43455	adjutant to RaÃ©vskiâs Redoubt. His horse lagged behind the adjutantâs
 43456	and jolted him at every step.
 43457	
 43458	âYou donât seem to be used to riding, Count?â remarked the adjutant.
 43459	
 43460	âNo itâs not that, but her action seems so jerky,â said Pierre in a
 43461	puzzled tone.
 43462	
 43463	âWhy... sheâs wounded!â said the adjutant. âIn the off foreleg above the
 43464	knee. A bullet, no doubt. I congratulate you, Count, on your baptism of
 43465	fire!â
 43466	
 43467	Having ridden in the smoke past the Sixth Corps, behind the artillery
 43468	which had been moved forward and was in action, deafening them with the
 43469	noise of firing, they came to a small wood. There it was cool and quiet,
 43470	with a scent of autumn. Pierre and the adjutant dismounted and walked up
 43471	the hill on foot.
 43472	
 43473	âIs the general here?â asked the adjutant on reaching the knoll.
 43474	
 43475	âHe was here a minute ago but has just gone that way,â someone told him,
 43476	pointing to the right.
 43477	
 43478	The adjutant looked at Pierre as if puzzled what to do with him now.
 43479	
 43480	âDonât trouble about me,â said Pierre. âIâll go up onto the knoll if I
 43481	may?â
 43482	
 43483	âYes, do. Youâll see everything from there and itâs less dangerous, and
 43484	Iâll come for you.â
 43485	
 43486	Pierre went to the battery and the adjutant rode on. They did not meet
 43487	again, and only much later did Pierre learn that he lost an arm that
 43488	day.
 43489	
 43490	The knoll to which Pierre ascended was that famous one afterwards known
 43491	to the Russians as the Knoll Battery or RaÃ©vskiâs Redoubt, and to the
 43492	French as la grande redoute, la fatale redoute, la redoute du centre,
 43493	around which tens of thousands fell, and which the French regarded as
 43494	the key to the whole position.
 43495	
 43496	This redoubt consisted of a knoll, on three sides of which trenches had
 43497	been dug. Within the entrenchment stood ten guns that were being fired
 43498	through openings in the earthwork.
 43499	
 43500	In line with the knoll on both sides stood other guns which also fired
 43501	incessantly. A little behind the guns stood infantry. When ascending
 43502	that knoll Pierre had no notion that this spot, on which small trenches
 43503	had been dug and from which a few guns were firing, was the most
 43504	important point of the battle.
 43505	
 43506	On the contrary, just because he happened to be there he thought it one
 43507	of the least significant parts of the field.
 43508	
 43509	Having reached the knoll, Pierre sat down at one end of a trench
 43510	surrounding the battery and gazed at what was going on around him with
 43511	an unconsciously happy smile. Occasionally he rose and walked about the
 43512	battery still with that same smile, trying not to obstruct the soldiers
 43513	who were loading, hauling the guns, and continually running past
 43514	him with bags and charges. The guns of that battery were being fired
 43515	continually one after another with a deafening roar, enveloping the
 43516	whole neighborhood in powder smoke.
 43517	
 43518	In contrast with the dread felt by the infantrymen placed in support,
 43519	here in the battery where a small number of men busy at their work were
 43520	separated from the rest by a trench, everyone experienced a common and
 43521	as it were family feeling of animation.
 43522	
 43523	The intrusion of Pierreâs nonmilitary figure in a white hat made an
 43524	unpleasant impression at first. The soldiers looked askance at him with
 43525	surprise and even alarm as they went past him. The senior artillery
 43526	officer, a tall, long-legged, pockmarked man, moved over to Pierre as if
 43527	to see the action of the farthest gun and looked at him with curiosity.
 43528	
 43529	A young round-faced officer, quite a boy still and evidently only just
 43530	out of the Cadet College, who was zealously commanding the two guns
 43531	entrusted to him, addressed Pierre sternly.
 43532	
 43533	âSir,â he said, âpermit me to ask you to stand aside. You must not be
 43534	here.â
 43535	
 43536	The soldiers shook their heads disapprovingly as they looked at Pierre.
 43537	But when they had convinced themselves that this man in the white hat
 43538	was doing no harm, but either sat quietly on the slope of the trench
 43539	with a shy smile or, politely making way for the soldiers, paced up
 43540	and down the battery under fire as calmly as if he were on a boulevard,
 43541	their feeling of hostile distrust gradually began to change into a
 43542	kindly and bantering sympathy, such as soldiers feel for their dogs,
 43543	cocks, goats, and in general for the animals that live with the
 43544	regiment. The men soon accepted Pierre into their family, adopted him,
 43545	gave him a nickname (âour gentlemanâ), and made kindly fun of him among
 43546	themselves.
 43547	
 43548	A shell tore up the earth two paces from Pierre and he looked around
 43549	with a smile as he brushed from his clothes some earth it had thrown up.
 43550	
 43551	âAnd howâs it youâre not afraid, sir, really now?â a red-faced,
 43552	broad-shouldered soldier asked Pierre, with a grin that disclosed a set
 43553	of sound, white teeth.
 43554	
 43555	âAre you afraid, then?â said Pierre.
 43556	
 43557	âWhat else do you expect?â answered the soldier. âShe has no mercy, you
 43558	know! When she comes spluttering down, out go your innards. One canât
 43559	help being afraid,â he said laughing.
 43560	
 43561	Several of the men, with bright kindly faces, stopped beside Pierre.
 43562	They seemed not to have expected him to talk like anybody else, and the
 43563	discovery that he did so delighted them.
 43564	
 43565	âItâs the business of us soldiers. But in a gentleman itâs wonderful!
 43566	Thereâs a gentleman for you!â
 43567	
 43568	âTo your places!â cried the young officer to the men gathered round
 43569	Pierre.
 43570	
 43571	The young officer was evidently exercising his duties for the first or
 43572	second time and therefore treated both his superiors and the men with
 43573	great precision and formality.
 43574	
 43575	The booming cannonade and the fusillade of musketry were growing more
 43576	intense over the whole field, especially to the left where BagratiÃ³nâs
 43577	flÃ¨ches were, but where Pierre was the smoke of the firing made it
 43578	almost impossible to distinguish anything. Moreover, his whole
 43579	attention was engrossed by watching the family circleâseparated from all
 43580	elseâformed by the men in the battery. His first unconscious feeling of
 43581	joyful animation produced by the sights and sounds of the battlefield
 43582	was now replaced by another, especially since he had seen that soldier
 43583	lying alone in the hayfield. Now, seated on the slope of the trench, he
 43584	observed the faces of those around him.
 43585	
 43586	By ten oâclock some twenty men had already been carried away from the
 43587	battery; two guns were smashed and cannon balls fell more and more
 43588	frequently on the battery and spent bullets buzzed and whistled around.
 43589	But the men in the battery seemed not to notice this, and merry voices
 43590	and jokes were heard on all sides.
 43591	
 43592	âA live one!â shouted a man as a whistling shell approached.
 43593	
 43594	âNot this way! To the infantry!â added another with loud laughter,
 43595	seeing the shell fly past and fall into the ranks of the supports.
 43596	
 43597	âAre you bowing to a friend, eh?â remarked another, chaffing a peasant
 43598	who ducked low as a cannon ball flew over.
 43599	
 43600	Several soldiers gathered by the wall of the trench, looking out to see
 43601	what was happening in front.
 43602	
 43603	âTheyâve withdrawn the front line, it has retired,â said they, pointing
 43604	over the earthwork.
 43605	
 43606	âMind your own business,â an old sergeant shouted at them. âIf theyâve
 43607	retired itâs because thereâs work for them to do farther back.â
 43608	
 43609	And the sergeant, taking one of the men by the shoulders, gave him a
 43610	shove with his knee. This was followed by a burst of laughter.
 43611	
 43612	âTo the fifth gun, wheel it up!â came shouts from one side.
 43613	
 43614	âNow then, all together, like bargees!â rose the merry voices of those
 43615	who were moving the gun.
 43616	
 43617	âOh, she nearly knocked our gentlemanâs hat off!â cried the red-faced
 43618	humorist, showing his teeth chaffing Pierre. âAwkward baggage!â he added
 43619	reproachfully to a cannon ball that struck a cannon wheel and a manâs
 43620	leg.
 43621	
 43622	âNow then, you foxes!â said another, laughing at some militiamen who,
 43623	stooping low, entered the battery to carry away the wounded man.
 43624	
 43625	âSo this gruel isnât to your taste? Oh, you crows! Youâre scared!â they
 43626	shouted at the militiamen who stood hesitating before the man whose leg
 43627	had been torn off.
 43628	
 43629	âThere, lads... oh, oh!â they mimicked the peasants, âthey donât like it
 43630	at all!â
 43631	
 43632	Pierre noticed that after every ball that hit the redoubt, and after
 43633	every loss, the liveliness increased more and more.
 43634	
 43635	As the flames of the fire hidden within come more and more vividly and
 43636	rapidly from an approaching thundercloud, so, as if in opposition to
 43637	what was taking place, the lightning of hidden fire growing more and
 43638	more intense glowed in the faces of these men.
 43639	
 43640	Pierre did not look out at the battlefield and was not concerned to know
 43641	what was happening there; he was entirely absorbed in watching this fire
 43642	which burned ever more brightly and which he felt was flaming up in the
 43643	same way in his own soul.
 43644	
 43645	At ten oâclock the infantry that had been among the bushes in front of
 43646	the battery and along the KÃ¡menka streamlet retreated. From the battery
 43647	they could be seen running back past it carrying their wounded on
 43648	their muskets. A general with his suite came to the battery, and after
 43649	speaking to the colonel gave Pierre an angry look and went away again
 43650	having ordered the infantry supports behind the battery to lie down,
 43651	so as to be less exposed to fire. After this from amid the ranks of
 43652	infantry to the right of the battery came the sound of a drum and shouts
 43653	of command, and from the battery one saw how those ranks of infantry
 43654	moved forward.
 43655	
 43656	Pierre looked over the wall of the trench and was particularly struck
 43657	by a pale young officer who, letting his sword hang down, was walking
 43658	backwards and kept glancing uneasily around.
 43659	
 43660	The ranks of the infantry disappeared amid the smoke but their
 43661	long-drawn shout and rapid musketry firing could still be heard. A few
 43662	minutes later crowds of wounded men and stretcher-bearers came back from
 43663	that direction. Projectiles began to fall still more frequently in the
 43664	battery. Several men were lying about who had not been removed. Around
 43665	the cannon the men moved still more briskly and busily. No one any
 43666	longer took notice of Pierre. Once or twice he was shouted at for being
 43667	in the way. The senior officer moved with big, rapid strides from one
 43668	gun to another with a frowning face. The young officer, with his face
 43669	still more flushed, commanded the men more scrupulously than ever. The
 43670	soldiers handed up the charges, turned, loaded, and did their business
 43671	with strained smartness. They gave little jumps as they walked, as
 43672	though they were on springs.
 43673	
 43674	The stormcloud had come upon them, and in every face the fire which
 43675	Pierre had watched kindle burned up brightly. Pierre standing beside the
 43676	commanding officer. The young officer, his hand to his shako, ran up to
 43677	his superior.
 43678	
 43679	âI have the honor to report, sir, that only eight rounds are left. Are
 43680	we to continue firing?â he asked.
 43681	
 43682	âGrapeshot!â the senior shouted, without answering the question, looking
 43683	over the wall of the trench.
 43684	
 43685	Suddenly something happened: the young officer gave a gasp and bending
 43686	double sat down on the ground like a bird shot on the wing. Everything
 43687	became strange, confused, and misty in Pierreâs eyes.
 43688	
 43689	One cannon ball after another whistled by and struck the earthwork, a
 43690	soldier, or a gun. Pierre, who had not noticed these sounds before,
 43691	now heard nothing else. On the right of the battery soldiers shouting
 43692	âHurrah!â were running not forwards but backwards, it seemed to Pierre.
 43693	
 43694	A cannon ball struck the very end of the earth work by which he was
 43695	standing, crumbling down the earth; a black ball flashed before his eyes
 43696	and at the same instant plumped into something. Some militiamen who were
 43697	entering the battery ran back.
 43698	
 43699	âAll with grapeshot!â shouted the officer.
 43700	
 43701	The sergeant ran up to the officer and in a frightened whisper informed
 43702	him (as a butler at dinner informs his master that there is no more of
 43703	some wine asked for) that there were no more charges.
 43704	
 43705	âThe scoundrels! What are they doing?â shouted the officer, turning to
 43706	Pierre.
 43707	
 43708	The officerâs face was red and perspiring and his eyes glittered under
 43709	his frowning brow.
 43710	
 43711	âRun to the reserves and bring up the ammunition boxes!â he yelled,
 43712	angrily avoiding Pierre with his eyes and speaking to his men.
 43713	
 43714	âIâll go,â said Pierre.
 43715	
 43716	The officer, without answering him, strode across to the opposite side.
 43717	
 43718	âDonât fire.... Wait!â he shouted.
 43719	
 43720	The man who had been ordered to go for ammunition stumbled against
 43721	Pierre.
 43722	
 43723	âEh, sir, this is no place for you,â said he, and ran down the slope.
 43724	
 43725	Pierre ran after him, avoiding the spot where the young officer was
 43726	sitting.
 43727	
 43728	One cannon ball, another, and a third flew over him, falling in front,
 43729	beside, and behind him. Pierre ran down the slope. âWhere am I going?â
 43730	he suddenly asked himself when he was already near the green ammunition
 43731	wagons. He halted irresolutely, not knowing whether to return or go on.
 43732	Suddenly a terrible concussion threw him backwards to the ground. At the
 43733	same instant he was dazzled by a great flash of flame, and immediately a
 43734	deafening roar, crackling, and whistling made his ears tingle.
 43735	
 43736	When he came to himself he was sitting on the ground leaning on his
 43737	hands; the ammunition wagons he had been approaching no longer existed,
 43738	only charred green boards and rags littered the scorched grass, and a
 43739	horse, dangling fragments of its shaft behind it, galloped past, while
 43740	another horse lay, like Pierre, on the ground, uttering prolonged and
 43741	piercing cries.

 43747	CHAPTER XXXII
 43748	
 43749	Beside himself with terror Pierre jumped up and ran back to the battery,
 43750	as to the only refuge from the horrors that surrounded him.
 43751	
 43752	On entering the earthwork he noticed that there were men doing something
 43753	there but that no shots were being fired from the battery. He had no
 43754	time to realize who these men were. He saw the senior officer lying on
 43755	the earth wall with his back turned as if he were examining something
 43756	down below and that one of the soldiers he had noticed before was
 43757	struggling forward shouting âBrothers!â and trying to free himself from
 43758	some men who were holding him by the arm. He also saw something else
 43759	that was strange.
 43760	
 43761	But he had not time to realize that the colonel had been killed, that
 43762	the soldier shouting âBrothers!â was a prisoner, and that another man
 43763	had been bayoneted in the back before his eyes, for hardly had he run
 43764	into the redoubt before a thin, sallow-faced, perspiring man in a blue
 43765	uniform rushed on him sword in hand, shouting something. Instinctively
 43766	guarding against the shockâfor they had been running together at full
 43767	speed before they saw one anotherâPierre put out his hands and seized
 43768	the man (a French officer) by the shoulder with one hand and by the
 43769	throat with the other. The officer, dropping his sword, seized Pierre by
 43770	his collar.
 43771	
 43772	For some seconds they gazed with frightened eyes at one anotherâs
 43773	unfamiliar faces and both were perplexed at what they had done and
 43774	what they were to do next. âAm I taken prisoner or have I taken him
 43775	prisoner?â each was thinking. But the French officer was evidently more
 43776	inclined to think he had been taken prisoner because Pierreâs strong
 43777	hand, impelled by instinctive fear, squeezed his throat ever tighter and
 43778	tighter. The Frenchman was about to say something, when just above their
 43779	heads, terrible and low, a cannon ball whistled, and it seemed to Pierre
 43780	that the French officerâs head had been torn off, so swiftly had he
 43781	ducked it.
 43782	
 43783	Pierre too bent his head and let his hands fall. Without further thought
 43784	as to who had taken whom prisoner, the Frenchman ran back to the battery
 43785	and Pierre ran down the slope stumbling over the dead and wounded who,
 43786	it seemed to him, caught at his feet. But before he reached the foot
 43787	of the knoll he was met by a dense crowd of Russian soldiers who,
 43788	stumbling, tripping up, and shouting, ran merrily and wildly toward
 43789	the battery. (This was the attack for which ErmÃ³lov claimed the credit,
 43790	declaring that only his courage and good luck made such a feat possible:
 43791	it was the attack in which he was said to have thrown some St. Georgeâs
 43792	Crosses he had in his pocket into the battery for the first soldiers to
 43793	take who got there.)
 43794	
 43795	The French who had occupied the battery fled, and our troops shouting
 43796	âHurrah!â pursued them so far beyond the battery that it was difficult
 43797	to call them back.
 43798	
 43799	The prisoners were brought down from the battery and among them was
 43800	a wounded French general, whom the officers surrounded. Crowds of
 43801	woundedâsome known to Pierre and some unknownâRussians and French,
 43802	with faces distorted by suffering, walked, crawled, and were carried on
 43803	stretchers from the battery. Pierre again went up onto the knoll where
 43804	he had spent over an hour, and of that family circle which had received
 43805	him as a member he did not find a single one. There were many dead whom
 43806	he did not know, but some he recognized. The young officer still sat in
 43807	the same way, bent double, in a pool of blood at the edge of the earth
 43808	wall. The red-faced man was still twitching, but they did not carry him
 43809	away.
 43810	
 43811	Pierre ran down the slope once more.
 43812	
 43813	âNow they will stop it, now they will be horrified at what they have
 43814	done!â he thought, aimlessly going toward a crowd of stretcher bearers
 43815	moving from the battlefield.
 43816	
 43817	But behind the veil of smoke the sun was still high, and in front and
 43818	especially to the left, near SemÃ«novsk, something seemed to be seething
 43819	in the smoke, and the roar of cannon and musketry did not diminish, but
 43820	even increased to desperation like a man who, straining himself, shrieks
 43821	with all his remaining strength.

 43827	CHAPTER XXXIII
 43828	
 43829	The chief action of the battle of BorodinÃ³ was fought within the seven
 43830	thousand feet between BorodinÃ³ and BagratiÃ³nâs flÃ¨ches. Beyond that
 43831	space there was, on the one side, a demonstration made by the Russians
 43832	with UvÃ¡rovâs cavalry at midday, and on the other side, beyond UtÃ­tsa,
 43833	Poniatowskiâs collision with TÃºchkov; but these two were detached and
 43834	feeble actions in comparison with what took place in the center of the
 43835	battlefield. On the field between BorodinÃ³ and the flÃ¨ches, beside the
 43836	wood, the chief action of the day took place on an open space visible
 43837	from both sides and was fought in the simplest and most artless way.
 43838	
 43839	The battle began on both sides with a cannonade from several hundred
 43840	guns.
 43841	
 43842	Then when the whole field was covered with smoke, two divisions,
 43843	Campanâs and Dessaixâs, advanced from the French right, while Muratâs
 43844	troops advanced on BorodinÃ³ from their left.
 43845	
 43846	From the ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubt where Napoleon was standing the flÃ¨ches were
 43847	two thirds of a mile away, and it was more than a mile as the crow flies
 43848	to BorodinÃ³, so that Napoleon could not see what was happening there,
 43849	especially as the smoke mingling with the mist hid the whole locality.
 43850	The soldiers of Dessaixâs division advancing against the flÃ¨ches could
 43851	only be seen till they had entered the hollow that lay between them and
 43852	the flÃ¨ches. As soon as they had descended into that hollow, the smoke
 43853	of the guns and musketry on the flÃ¨ches grew so dense that it covered
 43854	the whole approach on that side of it. Through the smoke glimpses could
 43855	be caught of something blackâprobably menâand at times the glint of
 43856	bayonets. But whether they were moving or stationary, whether they were
 43857	French or Russian, could not be discovered from the ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubt.
 43858	
 43859	The sun had risen brightly and its slanting rays struck straight into
 43860	Napoleonâs face as, shading his eyes with his hand, he looked at the
 43861	flÃ¨ches. The smoke spread out before them, and at times it looked as if
 43862	the smoke were moving, at times as if the troops moved. Sometimes shouts
 43863	were heard through the firing, but it was impossible to tell what was
 43864	being done there.
 43865	
 43866	Napoleon, standing on the knoll, looked through a field glass, and in
 43867	its small circlet saw smoke and men, sometimes his own and sometimes
 43868	Russians, but when he looked again with the naked eye, he could not tell
 43869	where what he had seen was.
 43870	
 43871	He descended the knoll and began walking up and down before it.
 43872	
 43873	Occasionally he stopped, listened to the firing, and gazed intently at
 43874	the battlefield.
 43875	
 43876	But not only was it impossible to make out what was happening from where
 43877	he was standing down below, or from the knoll above on which some of his
 43878	generals had taken their stand, but even from the flÃ¨ches themselvesâin
 43879	which by this time there were now Russian and now French soldiers,
 43880	alternately or together, dead, wounded, alive, frightened, or
 43881	maddenedâeven at those flÃ¨ches themselves it was impossible to make out
 43882	what was taking place. There for several hours amid incessant cannon and
 43883	musketry fire, now Russians were seen alone, now Frenchmen alone, now
 43884	infantry, and now cavalry: they appeared, fired, fell, collided, not
 43885	knowing what to do with one another, screamed, and ran back again.
 43886	
 43887	From the battlefield adjutants he had sent out, and orderlies from his
 43888	marshals, kept galloping up to Napoleon with reports of the progress
 43889	of the action, but all these reports were false, both because it was
 43890	impossible in the heat of battle to say what was happening at any given
 43891	moment and because many of the adjutants did not go to the actual place
 43892	of conflict but reported what they had heard from others; and also
 43893	because while an adjutant was riding more than a mile to Napoleon
 43894	circumstances changed and the news he brought was already becoming
 43895	false. Thus an adjutant galloped up from Murat with tidings that
 43896	BorodinÃ³ had been occupied and the bridge over the KolochÃ¡ was in the
 43897	hands of the French. The adjutant asked whether Napoleon wished the
 43898	troops to cross it? Napoleon gave orders that the troops should form up
 43899	on the farther side and wait. But before that order was givenâalmost
 43900	as soon in fact as the adjutant had left BorodinÃ³âthe bridge had been
 43901	retaken by the Russians and burned, in the very skirmish at which Pierre
 43902	had been present at the beginning of the battle.
 43903	
 43904	An adjutant galloped up from the flÃ¨ches with a pale and frightened face
 43905	and reported to Napoleon that their attack had been repulsed, Campan
 43906	wounded, and Davout killed; yet at the very time the adjutant had been
 43907	told that the French had been repulsed, the flÃ¨ches had in fact been
 43908	recaptured by other French troops, and Davout was alive and only
 43909	slightly bruised. On the basis of these necessarily untrustworthy
 43910	reports Napoleon gave his orders, which had either been executed before
 43911	he gave them or could not be and were not executed.
 43912	
 43913	The marshals and generals, who were nearer to the field of battle
 43914	but, like Napoleon, did not take part in the actual fighting and only
 43915	occasionally went within musket range, made their own arrangements
 43916	without asking Napoleon and issued orders where and in what direction to
 43917	fire and where cavalry should gallop and infantry should run. But even
 43918	their orders, like Napoleonâs, were seldom carried out, and then but
 43919	partially. For the most part things happened contrary to their orders.
 43920	Soldiers ordered to advance ran back on meeting grapeshot; soldiers
 43921	ordered to remain where they were, suddenly, seeing Russians
 43922	unexpectedly before them, sometimes rushed back and sometimes forward,
 43923	and the cavalry dashed without orders in pursuit of the flying Russians.
 43924	In this way two cavalry regiments galloped through the SemÃ«novsk hollow
 43925	and as soon as they reached the top of the incline turned round and
 43926	galloped full speed back again. The infantry moved in the same way,
 43927	sometimes running to quite other places than those they were ordered to
 43928	go to. All orders as to where and when to move the guns, when to send
 43929	infantry to shoot or horsemen to ride down the Russian infantryâall
 43930	such orders were given by the officers on the spot nearest to the
 43931	units concerned, without asking either Ney, Davout, or Murat, much less
 43932	Napoleon. They did not fear getting into trouble for not fulfilling
 43933	orders or for acting on their own initiative, for in battle what is at
 43934	stake is what is dearest to manâhis own lifeâand it sometimes seems that
 43935	safety lies in running back, sometimes in running forward; and these men
 43936	who were right in the heat of the battle acted according to the mood
 43937	of the moment. In reality, however, all these movements forward and
 43938	backward did not improve or alter the position of the troops. All
 43939	their rushing and galloping at one another did little harm, the harm of
 43940	disablement and death was caused by the balls and bullets that flew over
 43941	the fields on which these men were floundering about. As soon as they
 43942	left the place where the balls and bullets were flying about, their
 43943	superiors, located in the background, re-formed them and brought them
 43944	under discipline and under the influence of that discipline led them
 43945	back to the zone of fire, where under the influence of fear of death
 43946	they lost their discipline and rushed about according to the chance
 43947	promptings of the throng.
 43948	
 43949	
 43950	
 43951	
 43952	
 43953	CHAPTER XXXIV
 43954	
 43955	Napoleonâs generalsâDavout, Ney, and Murat, who were near that region of
 43956	fire and sometimes even entered itârepeatedly led into it huge masses of
 43957	well-ordered troops. But contrary to what had always happened in their
 43958	former battles, instead of the news they expected of the enemyâs flight,
 43959	these orderly masses returned thence as disorganized and terrified mobs.
 43960	The generals re-formed them, but their numbers constantly decreased.
 43961	In the middle of the day Murat sent his adjutant to Napoleon to demand
 43962	reinforcements.
 43963	
 43964	Napoleon sat at the foot of the knoll, drinking punch, when Muratâs
 43965	adjutant galloped up with an assurance that the Russians would be routed
 43966	if His Majesty would let him have another division.
 43967	
 43968	âReinforcements?â said Napoleon in a tone of stern surprise, looking at
 43969	the adjutantâa handsome lad with long black curls arranged like Muratâs
 43970	ownâas though he did not understand his words.
 43971	
 43972	âReinforcements!â thought Napoleon to himself. âHow can they need
 43973	reinforcements when they already have half the army directed against a
 43974	weak, unentrenched Russian wing?â
 43975	
 43976	âTell the King of Naples,â said he sternly, âthat it is not noon yet,
 43977	and I donât yet see my chessboard clearly. Go!...â
 43978	
 43979	The handsome boy adjutant with the long hair sighed deeply without
 43980	removing his hand from his hat and galloped back to where men were being
 43981	slaughtered.
 43982	
 43983	Napoleon rose and having summoned Caulaincourt and Berthier began
 43984	talking to them about matters unconnected with the battle.
 43985	
 43986	In the midst of this conversation, which was beginning to interest
 43987	Napoleon, Berthierâs eyes turned to look at a general with a suite, who
 43988	was galloping toward the knoll on a lathering horse. It was Belliard.
 43989	Having dismounted he went up to the Emperor with rapid strides and in
 43990	a loud voice began boldly demonstrating the necessity of sending
 43991	reinforcements. He swore on his honor that the Russians were lost if the
 43992	Emperor would give another division.
 43993	
 43994	Napoleon shrugged his shoulders and continued to pace up and down
 43995	without replying. Belliard began talking loudly and eagerly to the
 43996	generals of the suite around him.
 43997	
 43998	âYou are very fiery, Belliard,â said Napoleon, when he again came up to
 43999	the general. âIn the heat of a battle it is easy to make a mistake. Go
 44000	and have another look and then come back to me.â
 44001	
 44002	Before Belliard was out of sight, a messenger from another part of the
 44003	battlefield galloped up.
 44004	
 44005	âNow then, what do you want?â asked Napoleon in the tone of a man
 44006	irritated at being continually disturbed.
 44007	
 44008	âSire, the prince...â began the adjutant.
 44009	
 44010	âAsks for reinforcements?â said Napoleon with an angry gesture.
 44011	
 44012	The adjutant bent his head affirmatively and began to report, but the
 44013	Emperor turned from him, took a couple of steps, stopped, came back, and
 44014	called Berthier.
 44015	
 44016	âWe must give reserves,â he said, moving his arms slightly apart.
 44017	âWho do you think should be sent there?â he asked of Berthier (whom he
 44018	subsequently termed âthat gosling I have made an eagleâ).
 44019	
 44020	âSend ClaparÃ¨deâs division, sire,â replied Berthier, who knew all the
 44021	divisionâs regiments, and battalions by heart.
 44022	
 44023	Napoleon nodded assent.
 44024	
 44025	The adjutant galloped to ClaparÃ¨deâs division and a few minutes later
 44026	the Young Guards stationed behind the knoll moved forward. Napoleon
 44027	gazed silently in that direction.
 44028	
 44029	âNo!â he suddenly said to Berthier. âI canât send ClaparÃ¨de. Send
 44030	Friantâs division.â
 44031	
 44032	Though there was no advantage in sending Friantâs division instead of
 44033	ClaparÃ¨deâs, and even an obvious inconvenience and delay in stopping
 44034	ClaparÃ¨de and sending Friant now, the order was carried out exactly.
 44035	Napoleon did not notice that in regard to his army he was playing
 44036	the part of a doctor who hinders by his medicinesâa role he so justly
 44037	understood and condemned.
 44038	
 44039	Friantâs division disappeared as the others had done into the smoke
 44040	of the battlefield. From all sides adjutants continued to arrive at a
 44041	gallop and as if by agreement all said the same thing. They all asked
 44042	for reinforcements and all said that the Russians were holding their
 44043	positions and maintaining a hellish fire under which the French army was
 44044	melting away.
 44045	
 44046	Napoleon sat on a campstool, wrapped in thought.
 44047	
 44048	M. de Beausset, the man so fond of travel, having fasted since morning,
 44049	came up to the Emperor and ventured respectfully to suggest lunch to His
 44050	Majesty.
 44051	
 44052	âI hope I may now congratulate Your Majesty on a victory?â said he.
 44053	
 44054	Napoleon silently shook his head in negation. Assuming the negation to
 44055	refer only to the victory and not to the lunch, M. de Beausset ventured
 44056	with respectful jocularity to remark that there is no reason for not
 44057	having lunch when one can get it.
 44058	
 44059	âGo away...â exclaimed Napoleon suddenly and morosely, and turned aside.
 44060	
 44061	A beatific smile of regret, repentance, and ecstasy beamed on M. de
 44062	Beaussetâs face and he glided away to the other generals.
 44063	
 44064	Napoleon was experiencing a feeling of depression like that of an
 44065	ever-lucky gambler who, after recklessly flinging money about and always
 44066	winning, suddenly just when he has calculated all the chances of the
 44067	game, finds that the more he considers his play the more surely he
 44068	loses.
 44069	
 44070	His troops were the same, his generals the same, the same preparations
 44071	had been made, the same dispositions, and the same proclamation courte
 44072	et Ã©nergique, he himself was still the same: he knew that and knew that
 44073	he was now even more experienced and skillful than before. Even the
 44074	enemy was the same as at Austerlitz and Friedlandâyet the terrible
 44075	stroke of his arm had supernaturally become impotent.
 44076	
 44077	All the old methods that had been unfailingly crowned with success: the
 44078	concentration of batteries on one point, an attack by reserves to break
 44079	the enemyâs line, and a cavalry attack by âthe men of iron,â all these
 44080	methods had already been employed, yet not only was there no victory,
 44081	but from all sides came the same news of generals killed and wounded,
 44082	of reinforcements needed, of the impossibility of driving back the
 44083	Russians, and of disorganization among his own troops.
 44084	
 44085	Formerly, after he had given two or three orders and uttered a
 44086	few phrases, marshals and adjutants had come galloping up with
 44087	congratulations and happy faces, announcing the trophies taken, the
 44088	corps of prisoners, bundles of enemy eagles and standards, cannon and
 44089	stores, and Murat had only begged leave to loose the cavalry to gather
 44090	in the baggage wagons. So it had been at Lodi, Marengo, Arcola, Jena,
 44091	Austerlitz, Wagram, and so on. But now something strange was happening
 44092	to his troops.
 44093	
 44094	Despite news of the capture of the flÃ¨ches, Napoleon saw that this was
 44095	not the same, not at all the same, as what had happened in his former
 44096	battles. He saw that what he was feeling was felt by all the men about
 44097	him experienced in the art of war. All their faces looked dejected, and
 44098	they all shunned one anotherâs eyesâonly a de Beausset could fail to
 44099	grasp the meaning of what was happening.
 44100	
 44101	But Napoleon with his long experience of war well knew the meaning of
 44102	a battle not gained by the attacking side in eight hours, after all
 44103	efforts had been expended. He knew that it was a lost battle and that
 44104	the least accident might nowâwith the fight balanced on such a strained
 44105	centerâdestroy him and his army.
 44106	
 44107	When he ran his mind over the whole of this strange Russian campaign in
 44108	which not one battle had been won, and in which not a flag, or cannon,
 44109	or army corps had been captured in two months, when he looked at the
 44110	concealed depression on the faces around him and heard reports of the
 44111	Russians still holding their groundâa terrible feeling like a nightmare
 44112	took possession of him, and all the unlucky accidents that might destroy
 44113	him occurred to his mind. The Russians might fall on his left wing,
 44114	might break through his center, he himself might be killed by a stray
 44115	cannon ball. All this was possible. In former battles he had only
 44116	considered the possibilities of success, but now innumerable unlucky
 44117	chances presented themselves, and he expected them all. Yes, it was like
 44118	a dream in which a man fancies that a ruffian is coming to attack him,
 44119	and raises his arm to strike that ruffian a terrible blow which he knows
 44120	should annihilate him, but then feels that his arm drops powerless and
 44121	limp like a rag, and the horror of unavoidable destruction seizes him in
 44122	his helplessness.
 44123	
 44124	The news that the Russians were attacking the left flank of the French
 44125	army aroused that horror in Napoleon. He sat silently on a campstool
 44126	below the knoll, with head bowed and elbows on his knees. Berthier
 44127	approached and suggested that they should ride along the line to
 44128	ascertain the position of affairs.
 44129	
 44130	âWhat? What do you say?â asked Napoleon. âYes, tell them to bring me my
 44131	horse.â
 44132	
 44133	He mounted and rode toward SemÃ«novsk.
 44134	
 44135	Amid the powder smoke, slowly dispersing over the whole space through
 44136	which Napoleon rode, horses and men were lying in pools of blood, singly
 44137	or in heaps. Neither Napoleon nor any of his generals had ever before
 44138	seen such horrors or so many slain in such a small area. The roar of
 44139	guns, that had not ceased for ten hours, wearied the ear and gave
 44140	a peculiar significance to the spectacle, as music does to tableaux
 44141	vivants. Napoleon rode up the high ground at SemÃ«novsk, and through the
 44142	smoke saw ranks of men in uniforms of a color unfamiliar to him. They
 44143	were Russians.
 44144	
 44145	The Russians stood in serried ranks behind SemÃ«novsk village and its
 44146	knoll, and their guns boomed incessantly along their line and sent
 44147	forth clouds of smoke. It was no longer a battle: it was a continuous
 44148	slaughter which could be of no avail either to the French or the
 44149	Russians. Napoleon stopped his horse and again fell into the reverie
 44150	from which Berthier had aroused him. He could not stop what was going on
 44151	before him and around him and was supposed to be directed by him and to
 44152	depend on him, and from its lack of success this affair, for the first
 44153	time, seemed to him unnecessary and horrible.
 44154	
 44155	One of the generals rode up to Napoleon and ventured to offer to lead
 44156	the Old Guard into action. Ney and Berthier, standing near Napoleon,
 44157	exchanged looks and smiled contemptuously at this generalâs senseless
 44158	offer.
 44159	
 44160	Napoleon bowed his head and remained silent a long time.
 44161	
 44162	âAt eight hundred leagues from France, I will not have my Guard
 44163	destroyed!â he said, and turning his horse rode back to ShevÃ¡rdino.
 44164

 44169	CHAPTER XXXV
 44170	
 44171	On the rug-covered bench where Pierre had seen him in the morning sat
 44172	KutÃºzov, his gray head hanging, his heavy body relaxed. He gave no
 44173	orders, but only assented to or dissented from what others suggested.
 44174	
 44175	âYes, yes, do that,â he replied to various proposals. âYes, yes: go,
 44176	dear boy, and have a look,â he would say to one or another of those
 44177	about him; or, âNo, donât, weâd better wait!â He listened to the reports
 44178	that were brought him and gave directions when his subordinates demanded
 44179	that of him; but when listening to the reports it seemed as if he
 44180	were not interested in the import of the words spoken, but rather in
 44181	something elseâin the expression of face and tone of voice of those who
 44182	were reporting. By long years of military experience he knew, and with
 44183	the wisdom of age understood, that it is impossible for one man to
 44184	direct hundreds of thousands of others struggling with death, and he
 44185	knew that the result of a battle is decided not by the orders of a
 44186	commander in chief, nor the place where the troops are stationed, nor by
 44187	the number of cannon or of slaughtered men, but by that intangible force
 44188	called the spirit of the army, and he watched this force and guided it
 44189	in as far as that was in his power.
 44190	
 44191	KutÃºzovâs general expression was one of concentrated quiet attention,
 44192	and his face wore a strained look as if he found it difficult to master
 44193	the fatigue of his old and feeble body.
 44194	
 44195	At eleven oâclock they brought him news that the flÃ¨ches captured by the
 44196	French had been retaken, but that Prince BagratiÃ³n was wounded. KutÃºzov
 44197	groaned and swayed his head.
 44198	
 44199	âRide over to Prince Peter IvÃ¡novich and find out about it exactly,â he
 44200	said to one of his adjutants, and then turned to the Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg
 44201	who was standing behind him.
 44202	
 44203	âWill Your Highness please take command of the first army?â
 44204	
 44205	Soon after the dukeâs departureâbefore he could possibly have reached
 44206	SemÃ«novskâhis adjutant came back from him and told KutÃºzov that the duke
 44207	asked for more troops.
 44208	
 44209	KutÃºzov made a grimace and sent an order to DokhtÃºrov to take over the
 44210	command of the first army, and a request to the dukeâwhom he said he
 44211	could not spare at such an important momentâto return to him. When
 44212	they brought him news that Murat had been taken prisoner, and the staff
 44213	officers congratulated him, KutÃºzov smiled.
 44214	
 44215	âWait a little, gentlemen,â said he. âThe battle is won, and there is
 44216	nothing extraordinary in the capture of Murat. Still, it is better to
 44217	wait before we rejoice.â
 44218	
 44219	But he sent an adjutant to take the news round the army.
 44220	
 44221	When ScherbÃ­nin came galloping from the left flank with news that the
 44222	French had captured the flÃ¨ches and the village of SemÃ«novsk, KutÃºzov,
 44223	guessing by the sounds of the battle and by ScherbÃ­ninâs looks that the
 44224	news was bad, rose as if to stretch his legs and, taking ScherbÃ­ninâs
 44225	arm, led him aside.
 44226	
 44227	âGo, my dear fellow,â he said to ErmÃ³lov, âand see whether something
 44228	canât be done.â
 44229	
 44230	KutÃºzov was in GÃ³rki, near the center of the Russian position. The
 44231	attack directed by Napoleon against our left flank had been several
 44232	times repulsed. In the center the French had not got beyond BorodinÃ³,
 44233	and on their left flank UvÃ¡rovâs cavalry had put the French to flight.
 44234	
 44235	Toward three oâclock the French attacks ceased. On the faces of all
 44236	who came from the field of battle, and of those who stood around him,
 44237	KutÃºzov noticed an expression of extreme tension. He was satisfied with
 44238	the dayâs successâa success exceeding his expectations, but the old
 44239	manâs strength was failing him. Several times his head dropped low as if
 44240	it were falling and he dozed off. Dinner was brought him.
 44241	
 44242	Adjutant General Wolzogen, the man who when riding past Prince Andrew
 44243	had said, âthe war should be extended widely,â and whom BagratiÃ³n so
 44244	detested, rode up while KutÃºzov was at dinner. Wolzogen had come from
 44245	Barclay de Tolly to report on the progress of affairs on the left flank.
 44246	The sagacious Barclay de Tolly, seeing crowds of wounded men running
 44247	back and the disordered rear of the army, weighed all the circumstances,
 44248	concluded that the battle was lost, and sent his favorite officer to the
 44249	commander in chief with that news.
 44250	
 44251	KutÃºzov was chewing a piece of roast chicken with difficulty and glanced
 44252	at Wolzogen with eyes that brightened under their puckering lids.
 44253	
 44254	Wolzogen, nonchalantly stretching his legs, approached KutÃºzov with a
 44255	half-contemptuous smile on his lips, scarcely touching the peak of his
 44256	cap.
 44257	
 44258	He treated his Serene Highness with a somewhat affected nonchalance
 44259	intended to show that, as a highly trained military man, he left it to
 44260	Russians to make an idol of this useless old man, but that he knew whom
 44261	he was dealing with. âDer alte Herrâ (as in their own set the Germans
 44262	called KutÃºzov) âis making himself very comfortable,â thought Wolzogen,
 44263	and looking severely at the dishes in front of KutÃºzov he began to
 44264	report to âthe old gentlemanâ the position of affairs on the left flank
 44265	as Barclay had ordered him to and as he himself had seen and understood
 44266	it.
 44267	
 44268	âAll the points of our position are in the enemyâs hands and we cannot
 44269	dislodge them for lack of troops, the men are running away and it is
 44270	impossible to stop them,â he reported.
 44271	
 44272	KutÃºzov ceased chewing and fixed an astonished gaze on Wolzogen, as
 44273	if not understanding what was said to him. Wolzogen, noticing âthe old
 44274	gentlemanâsâ agitation, said with a smile:
 44275	
 44276	âI have not considered it right to conceal from your Serene Highness
 44277	what I have seen. The troops are in complete disorder....â
 44278	
 44279	âYou have seen? You have seen?...â KutÃºzov shouted. Frowning and rising
 44280	quickly, he went up to Wolzogen.
 44281	
 44282	âHow... how dare you!...â he shouted, choking and making a threatening
 44283	gesture with his trembling arms: âHow dare you, sir, say that to me? You
 44284	know nothing about it. Tell General Barclay from me that his information
 44285	is incorrect and that the real course of the battle is better known to
 44286	me, the commander in chief, than to him.â
 44287	
 44288	Wolzogen was about to make a rejoinder, but KutÃºzov interrupted him.
 44289	
 44290	âThe enemy has been repulsed on the left and defeated on the right
 44291	flank. If you have seen amiss, sir, do not allow yourself to say what
 44292	you donât know! Be so good as to ride to General Barclay and inform
 44293	him of my firm intention to attack the enemy tomorrow,â said KutÃºzov
 44294	sternly.
 44295	
 44296	All were silent, and the only sound audible was the heavy breathing of
 44297	the panting old general.
 44298	
 44299	âThey are repulsed everywhere, for which I thank God and our brave army!
 44300	The enemy is beaten, and tomorrow we shall drive him from the sacred
 44301	soil of Russia,â said KutÃºzov crossing himself, and he suddenly sobbed
 44302	as his eyes filled with tears.
 44303	
 44304	Wolzogen, shrugging his shoulders and curling his lips, stepped silently
 44305	aside, marveling at âthe old gentlemanâsâ conceited stupidity.
 44306	
 44307	âAh, here he is, my hero!â said KutÃºzov to a portly, handsome,
 44308	dark-haired general who was just ascending the knoll.
 44309	
 44310	This was RaÃ©vski, who had spent the whole day at the most important part
 44311	of the field of BorodinÃ³.
 44312	
 44313	RaÃ©vski reported that the troops were firmly holding their ground and
 44314	that the French no longer ventured to attack.
 44315	
 44316	After hearing him, KutÃºzov said in French:
 44317	
 44318	âThen you do not think, like some others, that we must retreat?â
 44319	
 44320	âOn the contrary, your Highness, in indecisive actions it is always
 44321	the most stubborn who remain victors,â replied RaÃ©vski, âand in my
 44322	opinion...â
 44323	
 44324	âKaysÃ¡rov!â KutÃºzov called to his adjutant. âSit down and write out
 44325	the order of the day for tomorrow. And you,â he continued, addressing
 44326	another, âride along the line and announce that tomorrow we attack.â
 44327	
 44328	While KutÃºzov was talking to RaÃ©vski and dictating the order of the day,
 44329	Wolzogen returned from Barclay and said that General Barclay wished to
 44330	have written confirmation of the order the field marshal had given.
 44331	
 44332	KutÃºzov, without looking at Wolzogen, gave directions for the order to
 44333	be written out which the former commander in chief, to avoid personal
 44334	responsibility, very judiciously wished to receive.
 44335	
 44336	And by means of that mysterious indefinable bond which maintains
 44337	throughout an army one and the same temper, known as âthe spirit of
 44338	the army,â and which constitutes the sinew of war, KutÃºzovâs words, his
 44339	order for a battle next day, immediately became known from one end of
 44340	the army to the other.
 44341	
 44342	It was far from being the same words or the same order that reached the
 44343	farthest links of that chain. The tales passing from mouth to mouth at
 44344	different ends of the army did not even resemble what KutÃºzov had said,
 44345	but the sense of his words spread everywhere because what he said was
 44346	not the outcome of cunning calculations, but of a feeling that lay in
 44347	the commander in chiefâs soul as in that of every Russian.
 44348	
 44349	And on learning that tomorrow they were to attack the enemy, and hearing
 44350	from the highest quarters a confirmation of what they wanted to believe,
 44351	the exhausted, wavering men felt comforted and inspirited.
 44352	
 44353	
 44354	
 44355	
 44356	
 44357	CHAPTER XXXVI
 44358	
 44359	Prince Andrewâs regiment was among the reserves which till after one
 44360	oâclock were stationed inactive behind SemÃ«novsk, under heavy artillery
 44361	fire. Toward two oâclock the regiment, having already lost more than
 44362	two hundred men, was moved forward into a trampled oatfield in the gap
 44363	between SemÃ«novsk and the Knoll Battery, where thousands of men perished
 44364	that day and on which an intense, concentrated fire from several hundred
 44365	enemy guns was directed between one and two oâclock.
 44366	
 44367	Without moving from that spot or firing a single shot the regiment here
 44368	lost another third of its men. From in front and especially from the
 44369	right, in the unlifting smoke the guns boomed, and out of the mysterious
 44370	domain of smoke that overlay the whole space in front, quick hissing
 44371	cannon balls and slow whistling shells flew unceasingly. At times, as
 44372	if to allow them a respite, a quarter of an hour passed during which
 44373	the cannon balls and shells all flew overhead, but sometimes several men
 44374	were torn from the regiment in a minute and the slain were continually
 44375	being dragged away and the wounded carried off.
 44376	
 44377	With each fresh blow less and less chance of life remained for those not
 44378	yet killed. The regiment stood in columns of battalion, three hundred
 44379	paces apart, but nevertheless the men were always in one and the same
 44380	mood. All alike were taciturn and morose. Talk was rarely heard in the
 44381	ranks, and it ceased altogether every time the thud of a successful
 44382	shot and the cry of âstretchers!â was heard. Most of the time, by their
 44383	officersâ order, the men sat on the ground. One, having taken off his
 44384	shako, carefully loosened the gathers of its lining and drew them tight
 44385	again; another, rubbing some dry clay between his palms, polished
 44386	his bayonet; another fingered the strap and pulled the buckle of his
 44387	bandolier, while another smoothed and refolded his leg bands and put
 44388	his boots on again. Some built little houses of the tufts in the plowed
 44389	ground, or plaited baskets from the straw in the cornfield. All seemed
 44390	fully absorbed in these pursuits. When men were killed or wounded, when
 44391	rows of stretchers went past, when some troops retreated, and when great
 44392	masses of the enemy came into view through the smoke, no one paid any
 44393	attention to these things. But when our artillery or cavalry advanced or
 44394	some of our infantry were seen to move forward, words of approval
 44395	were heard on all sides. But the liveliest attention was attracted by
 44396	occurrences quite apart from, and unconnected with, the battle. It was
 44397	as if the minds of these morally exhausted men found relief in everyday,
 44398	commonplace occurrences. A battery of artillery was passing in front of
 44399	the regiment. The horse of an ammunition cart put its leg over a trace.
 44400	âHey, look at the trace horse!... Get her leg out! Sheâll fall.... Ah,
 44401	they donât see it!â came identical shouts from the ranks all along the
 44402	regiment. Another time, general attention was attracted by a small brown
 44403	dog, coming heaven knows whence, which trotted in a preoccupied manner
 44404	in front of the ranks with tail stiffly erect till suddenly a shell fell
 44405	close by, when it yelped, tucked its tail between its legs, and darted
 44406	aside. Yells and shrieks of laughter rose from the whole regiment. But
 44407	such distractions lasted only a moment, and for eight hours the men had
 44408	been inactive, without food, in constant fear of death, and their pale
 44409	and gloomy faces grew ever paler and gloomier.
 44410	
 44411	Prince Andrew, pale and gloomy like everyone in the regiment, paced up
 44412	and down from the border of one patch to another, at the edge of the
 44413	meadow beside an oatfield, with head bowed and arms behind his back.
 44414	There was nothing for him to do and no orders to be given. Everything
 44415	went on of itself. The killed were dragged from the front, the wounded
 44416	carried away, and the ranks closed up. If any soldiers ran to the
 44417	rear they returned immediately and hastily. At first Prince Andrew,
 44418	considering it his duty to rouse the courage of the men and to set them
 44419	an example, walked about among the ranks, but he soon became convinced
 44420	that this was unnecessary and that there was nothing he could teach
 44421	them. All the powers of his soul, as of every soldier there, were
 44422	unconsciously bent on avoiding the contemplation of the horrors of their
 44423	situation. He walked along the meadow, dragging his feet, rustling the
 44424	grass, and gazing at the dust that covered his boots; now he took big
 44425	strides trying to keep to the footprints left on the meadow by the
 44426	mowers, then he counted his steps, calculating how often he must walk
 44427	from one strip to another to walk a mile, then he stripped the flowers
 44428	from the wormwood that grew along a boundary rut, rubbed them in his
 44429	palms, and smelled their pungent, sweetly bitter scent. Nothing remained
 44430	of the previous dayâs thoughts. He thought of nothing. He listened with
 44431	weary ears to the ever-recurring sounds, distinguishing the whistle
 44432	of flying projectiles from the booming of the reports, glanced at the
 44433	tiresomely familiar faces of the men of the first battalion, and
 44434	waited. âHere it comes... this one is coming our way again!â he thought,
 44435	listening to an approaching whistle in the hidden region of smoke. âOne,
 44436	another! Again! It has hit....â He stopped and looked at the ranks. âNo,
 44437	it has gone over. But this one has hit!â And again he started trying
 44438	to reach the boundary strip in sixteen paces. A whizz and a thud! Five
 44439	paces from him, a cannon ball tore up the dry earth and disappeared. A
 44440	chill ran down his back. Again he glanced at the ranks. Probably many
 44441	had been hitâa large crowd had gathered near the second battalion.
 44442	
 44443	âAdjutant!â he shouted. âOrder them not to crowd together.â
 44444	
 44445	The adjutant, having obeyed this instruction, approached Prince Andrew.
 44446	From the other side a battalion commander rode up.
 44447	
 44448	âLook out!â came a frightened cry from a soldier and, like a bird
 44449	whirring in rapid flight and alighting on the ground, a shell dropped
 44450	with little noise within two steps of Prince Andrew and close to the
 44451	battalion commanderâs horse. The horse first, regardless of whether it
 44452	was right or wrong to show fear, snorted, reared almost throwing the
 44453	major, and galloped aside. The horseâs terror infected the men.
 44454	
 44455	âLie down!â cried the adjutant, throwing himself flat on the ground.
 44456	
 44457	Prince Andrew hesitated. The smoking shell spun like a top between him
 44458	and the prostrate adjutant, near a wormwood plant between the field and
 44459	the meadow.
 44460	
 44461	âCan this be death?â thought Prince Andrew, looking with a quite new,
 44462	envious glance at the grass, the wormwood, and the streamlet of smoke
 44463	that curled up from the rotating black ball. âI cannot, I do not wish to
 44464	die. I love lifeâI love this grass, this earth, this air....â He thought
 44465	this, and at the same time remembered that people were looking at him.
 44466	
 44467	âItâs shameful, sir!â he said to the adjutant. âWhat...â
 44468	
 44469	He did not finish speaking. At one and the same moment came the sound of
 44470	an explosion, a whistle of splinters as from a breaking window frame,
 44471	a suffocating smell of powder, and Prince Andrew started to one side,
 44472	raising his arm, and fell on his chest. Several officers ran up to him.
 44473	From the right side of his abdomen, blood was welling out making a large
 44474	stain on the grass.
 44475	
 44476	The militiamen with stretchers who were called up stood behind the
 44477	officers. Prince Andrew lay on his chest with his face in the grass,
 44478	breathing heavily and noisily.
 44479	
 44480	âWhat are you waiting for? Come along!â
 44481	
 44482	The peasants went up and took him by his shoulders and legs, but he
 44483	moaned piteously and, exchanging looks, they set him down again.
 44484	
 44485	âPick him up, lift him, itâs all the same!â cried someone.
 44486	
 44487	They again took him by the shoulders and laid him on the stretcher.
 44488	
 44489	âAh, God! My God! What is it? The stomach? That means death! My
 44490	God!ââvoices among the officers were heard saying.
 44491	
 44492	âIt flew a hairâs breadth past my ear,â said the adjutant.
 44493	
 44494	The peasants, adjusting the stretcher to their shoulders, started
 44495	hurriedly along the path they had trodden down, to the dressing station.
 44496	
 44497	âKeep in step! Ah... those peasants!â shouted an officer, seizing by
 44498	their shoulders and checking the peasants, who were walking unevenly and
 44499	jolting the stretcher.
 44500	
 44501	âGet into step, FÃ«dor... I say, FÃ«dor!â said the foremost peasant.
 44502	
 44503	âNow thatâs right!â said the one behind joyfully, when he had got into
 44504	step.
 44505	
 44506	âYour excellency! Eh, Prince!â said the trembling voice of TimÃ³khin, who
 44507	had run up and was looking down on the stretcher.
 44508	
 44509	Prince Andrew opened his eyes and looked up at the speaker from the
 44510	stretcher into which his head had sunk deep and again his eyelids
 44511	drooped.
 44512	
 44513	
 44514	The militiamen carried Prince Andrew to the dressing station by the
 44515	wood, where wagons were stationed. The dressing station consisted of
 44516	three tents with flaps turned back, pitched at the edge of a birch wood.
 44517	In the wood, wagons and horses were standing. The horses were eating
 44518	oats from their movable troughs and sparrows flew down and pecked the
 44519	grains that fell. Some crows, scenting blood, flew among the birch
 44520	trees cawing impatiently. Around the tents, over more than five acres,
 44521	bloodstained men in various garbs stood, sat, or lay. Around the wounded
 44522	stood crowds of soldier stretcher-bearers with dismal and attentive
 44523	faces, whom the officers keeping order tried in vain to drive from the
 44524	spot. Disregarding the officersâ orders, the soldiers stood leaning
 44525	against their stretchers and gazing intently, as if trying to comprehend
 44526	the difficult problem of what was taking place before them. From the
 44527	tents came now loud angry cries and now plaintive groans. Occasionally
 44528	dressers ran out to fetch water, or to point out those who were to be
 44529	brought in next. The wounded men awaiting their turn outside the tents
 44530	groaned, sighed, wept, screamed, swore, or asked for vodka. Some were
 44531	delirious. Prince Andrewâs bearers, stepping over the wounded who had
 44532	not yet been bandaged, took him, as a regimental commander, close up to
 44533	one of the tents and there stopped, awaiting instructions. Prince Andrew
 44534	opened his eyes and for a long time could not make out what was going
 44535	on around him. He remembered the meadow, the wormwood, the field, the
 44536	whirling black ball, and his sudden rush of passionate love of life.
 44537	Two steps from him, leaning against a branch and talking loudly and
 44538	attracting general attention, stood a tall, handsome, black-haired
 44539	noncommissioned officer with a bandaged head. He had been wounded in the
 44540	head and leg by bullets. Around him, eagerly listening to his talk, a
 44541	crowd of wounded and stretcher-bearers was gathered.
 44542	
 44543	âWe kicked him out from there so that he chucked everything, we grabbed
 44544	the King himself!â cried he, looking around him with eyes that glittered
 44545	with fever. âIf only reserves had come up just then, lads, there
 44546	wouldnât have been nothing left of him! I tell you surely....â
 44547	
 44548	Like all the others near the speaker, Prince Andrew looked at him with
 44549	shining eyes and experienced a sense of comfort. âBut isnât it all the
 44550	same now?â thought he. âAnd what will be there, and what has there been
 44551	here? Why was I so reluctant to part with life? There was something in
 44552	this life I did not and do not understand.â
 44553	
 44554	
 44555	
 44556	
 44557	
 44558	CHAPTER XXXVII
 44559	
 44560	One of the doctors came out of the tent in a bloodstained apron,
 44561	holding a cigar between the thumb and little finger of one of his small
 44562	bloodstained hands, so as not to smear it. He raised his head and looked
 44563	about him, but above the level of the wounded men. He evidently wanted a
 44564	little respite. After turning his head from right to left for some time,
 44565	he sighed and looked down.
 44566	
 44567	âAll right, immediately,â he replied to a dresser who pointed Prince
 44568	Andrew out to him, and he told them to carry him into the tent.
 44569	
 44570	Murmurs arose among the wounded who were waiting.
 44571	
 44572	âIt seems that even in the next world only the gentry are to have a
 44573	chance!â remarked one.
 44574	
 44575	Prince Andrew was carried in and laid on a table that had only just been
 44576	cleared and which a dresser was washing down. Prince Andrew could not
 44577	make out distinctly what was in that tent. The pitiful groans from all
 44578	sides and the torturing pain in his thigh, stomach, and back distracted
 44579	him. All he saw about him merged into a general impression of naked,
 44580	bleeding human bodies that seemed to fill the whole of the low tent, as
 44581	a few weeks previously, on that hot August day, such bodies had filled
 44582	the dirty pond beside the SmolÃ©nsk road. Yes, it was the same flesh,
 44583	the same chair Ã  canon, the sight of which had even then filled him with
 44584	horror, as by a presentiment.
 44585	
 44586	There were three operating tables in the tent. Two were occupied, and
 44587	on the third they placed Prince Andrew. For a little while he was left
 44588	alone and involuntarily witnessed what was taking place on the other two
 44589	tables. On the nearest one sat a Tartar, probably a Cossack, judging by
 44590	the uniform thrown down beside him. Four soldiers were holding him, and
 44591	a spectacled doctor was cutting into his muscular brown back.
 44592	
 44593	âOoh, ooh, ooh!â grunted the Tartar, and suddenly lifting up his swarthy
 44594	snub-nosed face with its high cheekbones, and baring his white teeth,
 44595	he began to wriggle and twitch his body and utter piercing, ringing,
 44596	and prolonged yells. On the other table, round which many people were
 44597	crowding, a tall well-fed man lay on his back with his head thrown back.
 44598	His curly hair, its color, and the shape of his head seemed strangely
 44599	familiar to Prince Andrew. Several dressers were pressing on his chest
 44600	to hold him down. One large, white, plump leg twitched rapidly all
 44601	the time with a feverish tremor. The man was sobbing and choking
 44602	convulsively. Two doctorsâone of whom was pale and tremblingâwere
 44603	silently doing something to this manâs other, gory leg. When he had
 44604	finished with the Tartar, whom they covered with an overcoat, the
 44605	spectacled doctor came up to Prince Andrew, wiping his hands.
 44606	
 44607	He glanced at Prince Andrewâs face and quickly turned away.
 44608	
 44609	âUndress him! What are you waiting for?â he cried angrily to the
 44610	dressers.
 44611	
 44612	His very first, remotest recollections of childhood came back to Prince
 44613	Andrewâs mind when the dresser with sleeves rolled up began hastily to
 44614	undo the buttons of his clothes and undressed him. The doctor bent
 44615	down over the wound, felt it, and sighed deeply. Then he made a sign to
 44616	someone, and the torturing pain in his abdomen caused Prince Andrew to
 44617	lose consciousness. When he came to himself the splintered portions of
 44618	his thighbone had been extracted, the torn flesh cut away, and the
 44619	wound bandaged. Water was being sprinkled on his face. As soon as Prince
 44620	Andrew opened his eyes, the doctor bent over, kissed him silently on the
 44621	lips, and hurried away.
 44622	
 44623	After the sufferings he had been enduring, Prince Andrew enjoyed a
 44624	blissful feeling such as he had not experienced for a long time. All the
 44625	best and happiest moments of his lifeâespecially his earliest childhood,
 44626	when he used to be undressed and put to bed, and when leaning over him
 44627	his nurse sang him to sleep and he, burying his head in the pillow,
 44628	felt happy in the mere consciousness of lifeâreturned to his memory, not
 44629	merely as something past but as something present.
 44630	
 44631	The doctors were busily engaged with the wounded man the shape of whose
 44632	head seemed familiar to Prince Andrew: they were lifting him up and
 44633	trying to quiet him.
 44634	
 44635	âShow it to me.... Oh, ooh... Oh! Oh, ooh!â his frightened moans could
 44636	be heard, subdued by suffering and broken by sobs.
 44637	
 44638	Hearing those moans Prince Andrew wanted to weep. Whether because he
 44639	was dying without glory, or because he was sorry to part with life,
 44640	or because of those memories of a childhood that could not return, or
 44641	because he was suffering and others were suffering and that man near him
 44642	was groaning so piteouslyâhe felt like weeping childlike, kindly, and
 44643	almost happy tears.
 44644	
 44645	The wounded man was shown his amputated leg stained with clotted blood
 44646	and with the boot still on.
 44647	
 44648	âOh! Oh, ooh!â he sobbed, like a woman.
 44649	
 44650	The doctor who had been standing beside him, preventing Prince Andrew
 44651	from seeing his face, moved away.
 44652	
 44653	âMy God! What is this? Why is he here?â said Prince Andrew to himself.
 44654	
 44655	In the miserable, sobbing, enfeebled man whose leg had just been
 44656	amputated, he recognized Anatole KurÃ¡gin. Men were supporting him in
 44657	their arms and offering him a glass of water, but his trembling, swollen
 44658	lips could not grasp its rim. Anatole was sobbing painfully. âYes, it is
 44659	he! Yes, that man is somehow closely and painfully connected with me,â
 44660	thought Prince Andrew, not yet clearly grasping what he saw before him.
 44661	âWhat is the connection of that man with my childhood and life?â he
 44662	asked himself without finding an answer. And suddenly a new unexpected
 44663	memory from that realm of pure and loving childhood presented itself to
 44664	him. He remembered NatÃ¡sha as he had seen her for the first time at the
 44665	ball in 1810, with her slender neck and arms and with a frightened happy
 44666	face ready for rapture, and love and tenderness for her, stronger
 44667	and more vivid than ever, awoke in his soul. He now remembered the
 44668	connection that existed between himself and this man who was dimly
 44669	gazing at him through tears that filled his swollen eyes. He remembered
 44670	everything, and ecstatic pity and love for that man overflowed his happy
 44671	heart.
 44672	
 44673	Prince Andrew could no longer restrain himself and wept tender loving
 44674	tears for his fellow men, for himself, and for his own and their errors.
 44675	
 44676	âCompassion, love of our brothers, for those who love us and for those
 44677	who hate us, love of our enemies; yes, that love which God preached on
 44678	earth and which Princess Mary taught me and I did not understandâthat is
 44679	what made me sorry to part with life, that is what remained for me had I
 44680	lived. But now it is too late. I know it!â
 44681	
 44682	
 44683	
 44684	
 44685	
 44686	CHAPTER XXXVIII
 44687	
 44688	The terrible spectacle of the battlefield covered with dead and wounded,
 44689	together with the heaviness of his head and the news that some twenty
 44690	generals he knew personally had been killed or wounded, and the
 44691	consciousness of the impotence of his once mighty arm, produced an
 44692	unexpected impression on Napoleon who usually liked to look at the
 44693	killed and wounded, thereby, he considered, testing his strength of
 44694	mind. This day the horrible appearance of the battlefield overcame
 44695	that strength of mind which he thought constituted his merit and his
 44696	greatness. He rode hurriedly from the battlefield and returned to the
 44697	ShevÃ¡rdino knoll, where he sat on his campstool, his sallow face
 44698	swollen and heavy, his eyes dim, his nose red, and his voice hoarse,
 44699	involuntarily listening, with downcast eyes, to the sounds of firing.
 44700	With painful dejection he awaited the end of this action, in which he
 44701	regarded himself as a participant and which he was unable to arrest.
 44702	A personal, human feeling for a brief moment got the better of the
 44703	artificial phantasm of life he had served so long. He felt in his own
 44704	person the sufferings and death he had witnessed on the battlefield.
 44705	The heaviness of his head and chest reminded him of the possibility
 44706	of suffering and death for himself. At that moment he did not desire
 44707	Moscow, or victory, or glory (what need had he for any more glory?). The
 44708	one thing he wished for was rest, tranquillity, and freedom. But when he
 44709	had been on the SemÃ«novsk heights the artillery commander had proposed
 44710	to him to bring several batteries of artillery up to those heights to
 44711	strengthen the fire on the Russian troops crowded in front of KnyazkÃ³vo.
 44712	Napoleon had assented and had given orders that news should be brought
 44713	to him of the effect those batteries produced.
 44714	
 44715	An adjutant came now to inform him that the fire of two hundred guns
 44716	had been concentrated on the Russians, as he had ordered, but that they
 44717	still held their ground.
 44718	
 44719	âOur fire is mowing them down by rows, but still they hold on,â said the
 44720	adjutant.
 44721	
 44722	âThey want more!...â said Napoleon in a hoarse voice.
 44723	
 44724	âSire?â asked the adjutant who had not heard the remark.
 44725	
 44726	âThey want more!â croaked Napoleon frowning. âLet them have it!â
 44727	
 44728	Even before he gave that order the thing he did not desire, and for
 44729	which he gave the order only because he thought it was expected of him,
 44730	was being done. And he fell back into that artificial realm of imaginary
 44731	greatness, and againâas a horse walking a treadmill thinks it is doing
 44732	something for itselfâhe submissively fulfilled the cruel, sad, gloomy,
 44733	and inhuman role predestined for him.
 44734	
 44735	And not for that day and hour alone were the mind and conscience
 44736	darkened of this man on whom the responsibility for what was happening
 44737	lay more than on all the others who took part in it. Never to the end
 44738	of his life could he understand goodness, beauty, or truth, or the
 44739	significance of his actions which were too contrary to goodness and
 44740	truth, too remote from everything human, for him ever to be able to
 44741	grasp their meaning. He could not disavow his actions, belauded as they
 44742	were by half the world, and so he had to repudiate truth, goodness, and
 44743	all humanity.
 44744	
 44745	Not only on that day, as he rode over the battlefield strewn with men
 44746	killed and maimed (by his will as he believed), did he reckon as he
 44747	looked at them how many Russians there were for each Frenchman and,
 44748	deceiving himself, find reason for rejoicing in the calculation that
 44749	there were five Russians for every Frenchman. Not on that day alone
 44750	did he write in a letter to Paris that âthe battle field was superb,â
 44751	because fifty thousand corpses lay there, but even on the island of St.
 44752	Helena in the peaceful solitude where he said he intended to devote his
 44753	leisure to an account of the great deeds he had done, he wrote:
 44754	
 44755	The Russian war should have been the most popular war of modern times:
 44756	it was a war of good sense, for real interests, for the tranquillity and
 44757	security of all; it was purely pacific and conservative.
 44758	
 44759	It was a war for a great cause, the end of uncertainties and the
 44760	beginning of security. A new horizon and new labors were opening out,
 44761	full of well-being and prosperity for all. The European system was
 44762	already founded; all that remained was to organize it.
 44763	
 44764	Satisfied on these great points and with tranquility everywhere, I
 44765	too should have had my Congress and my Holy Alliance. Those ideas were
 44766	stolen from me. In that reunion of great sovereigns we should have
 44767	discussed our interests like one family, and have rendered account to
 44768	the peoples as clerk to master.
 44769	
 44770	Europe would in this way soon have been, in fact, but one people, and
 44771	anyone who traveled anywhere would have found himself always in the
 44772	common fatherland. I should have demanded the freedom of all navigable
 44773	rivers for everybody, that the seas should be common to all, and that
 44774	the great standing armies should be reduced henceforth to mere guards
 44775	for the sovereigns.
 44776	
 44777	On returning to France, to the bosom of the great, strong, magnificent,
 44778	peaceful, and glorious fatherland, I should have proclaimed
 44779	her frontiers immutable; all future wars purely defensive, all
 44780	aggrandizement antinational. I should have associated my son in the
 44781	Empire; my dictatorship would have been finished, and his constitutional
 44782	reign would have begun.
 44783	
 44784	Paris would have been the capital of the world, and the French the envy
 44785	of the nations!
 44786	
 44787	My leisure then, and my old age, would have been devoted, in company
 44788	with the Empress and during the royal apprenticeship of my son, to
 44789	leisurely visiting, with our own horses and like a true country couple,
 44790	every corner of the Empire, receiving complaints, redressing wrongs,
 44791	and scattering public buildings and benefactions on all sides and
 44792	everywhere.
 44793	
 44794	Napoleon, predestined by Providence for the gloomy role of executioner
 44795	of the peoples, assured himself that the aim of his actions had been the
 44796	peoplesâ welfare and that he could control the fate of millions and by
 44797	the employment of power confer benefactions.
 44798	
 44799	âOf four hundred thousand who crossed the Vistula,â he wrote further
 44800	of the Russian war, âhalf were Austrians, Prussians, Saxons, Poles,
 44801	Bavarians, WÃ¼rttembergers, Mecklenburgers, Spaniards, Italians, and
 44802	Neapolitans. The Imperial army, strictly speaking, was one third
 44803	composed of Dutch, Belgians, men from the borders of the Rhine,
 44804	Piedmontese, Swiss, Genevese, Tuscans, Romans, inhabitants of the
 44805	Thirty-second Military Division, of Bremen, of Hamburg, and so on: it
 44806	included scarcely a hundred and forty thousand who spoke French. The
 44807	Russian expedition actually cost France less than fifty thousand men;
 44808	the Russian army in its retreat from VÃ­lna to Moscow lost in the various
 44809	battles four times more men than the French army; the burning of Moscow
 44810	cost the lives of a hundred thousand Russians who died of cold and want
 44811	in the woods; finally, in its march from Moscow to the Oder the Russian
 44812	army also suffered from the severity of the season; so that by the time
 44813	it reached VÃ­lna it numbered only fifty thousand, and at KÃ¡lisch less
 44814	than eighteen thousand.â
 44815	
 44816	He imagined that the war with Russia came about by his will, and the
 44817	horrors that occurred did not stagger his soul. He boldly took the
 44818	whole responsibility for what happened, and his darkened mind found
 44819	justification in the belief that among the hundreds of thousands who
 44820	perished there were fewer Frenchmen than Hessians and Bavarians.
 44821	
 44822	
 44823	
 44824	
 44825	
 44826	CHAPTER XXXIX
 44827	
 44828	Several tens of thousands of the slain lay in diverse postures and
 44829	various uniforms on the fields and meadows belonging to the DavÃ½dov
 44830	family and to the crown serfsâthose fields and meadows where for
 44831	hundreds of years the peasants of BorodinÃ³, GÃ³rki, ShevÃ¡rdino, and
 44832	SemÃ«novsk had reaped their harvests and pastured their cattle. At the
 44833	dressing stations the grass and earth were soaked with blood for a space
 44834	of some three acres around. Crowds of men of various arms, wounded and
 44835	unwounded, with frightened faces, dragged themselves back to MozhÃ¡ysk
 44836	from the one army and back to ValÃºevo from the other. Other crowds,
 44837	exhausted and hungry, went forward led by their officers. Others held
 44838	their ground and continued to fire.
 44839	
 44840	Over the whole field, previously so gaily beautiful with the glitter of
 44841	bayonets and cloudlets of smoke in the morning sun, there now spread a
 44842	mist of damp and smoke and a strange acid smell of saltpeter and blood.
 44843	Clouds gathered and drops of rain began to fall on the dead and wounded,
 44844	on the frightened, exhausted, and hesitating men, as if to say: âEnough,
 44845	men! Enough! Cease... bethink yourselves! What are you doing?â
 44846	
 44847	To the men of both sides alike, worn out by want of food and rest,
 44848	it began equally to appear doubtful whether they should continue to
 44849	slaughter one another; all the faces expressed hesitation, and the
 44850	question arose in every soul: âFor what, for whom, must I kill and be
 44851	killed?... You may go and kill whom you please, but I donât want to do
 44852	so any more!â By evening this thought had ripened in every soul. At any
 44853	moment these men might have been seized with horror at what they were
 44854	doing and might have thrown up everything and run away anywhere.
 44855	
 44856	But though toward the end of the battle the men felt all the horror of
 44857	what they were doing, though they would have been glad to leave off,
 44858	some incomprehensible, mysterious power continued to control them, and
 44859	they still brought up the charges, loaded, aimed, and applied the match,
 44860	though only one artilleryman survived out of every three, and though
 44861	they stumbled and panted with fatigue, perspiring and stained with blood
 44862	and powder. The cannon balls flew just as swiftly and cruelly from both
 44863	sides, crushing human bodies, and that terrible work which was not done
 44864	by the will of a man but at the will of Him who governs men and worlds
 44865	continued.
 44866	
 44867	Anyone looking at the disorganized rear of the Russian army would have
 44868	said that, if only the French made one more slight effort, it would
 44869	disappear; and anyone looking at the rear of the French army would have
 44870	said that the Russians need only make one more slight effort and the
 44871	French would be destroyed. But neither the French nor the Russians made
 44872	that effort, and the flame of battle burned slowly out.
 44873	
 44874	The Russians did not make that effort because they were not attacking
 44875	the French. At the beginning of the battle they stood blocking the
 44876	way to Moscow and they still did so at the end of the battle as at the
 44877	beginning. But even had the aim of the Russians been to drive the French
 44878	from their positions, they could not have made this last effort, for all
 44879	the Russian troops had been broken up, there was no part of the Russian
 44880	army that had not suffered in the battle, and though still holding their
 44881	positions they had lost ONE HALF of their army.
 44882	
 44883	The French, with the memory of all their former victories during
 44884	fifteen years, with the assurance of Napoleonâs invincibility, with the
 44885	consciousness that they had captured part of the battlefield and had
 44886	lost only a quarter of their men and still had their Guards intact,
 44887	twenty thousand strong, might easily have made that effort. The French
 44888	who had attacked the Russian army in order to drive it from its position
 44889	ought to have made that effort, for as long as the Russians continued to
 44890	block the road to Moscow as before, the aim of the French had not been
 44891	attained and all their efforts and losses were in vain. But the French
 44892	did not make that effort. Some historians say that Napoleon need only
 44893	have used his Old Guards, who were intact, and the battle would have
 44894	been won. To speak of what would have happened had Napoleon sent his
 44895	Guards is like talking of what would happen if autumn became spring. It
 44896	could not be. Napoleon did not give his Guards, not because he did not
 44897	want to, but because it could not be done. All the generals, officers,
 44898	and soldiers of the French army knew it could not be done, because the
 44899	flagging spirit of the troops would not permit it.
 44900	
 44901	It was not Napoleon alone who had experienced that nightmare feeling
 44902	of the mighty arm being stricken powerless, but all the generals and
 44903	soldiers of his army whether they had taken part in the battle or not,
 44904	after all their experience of previous battlesâwhen after one tenth of
 44905	such efforts the enemy had fledâexperienced a similar feeling of terror
 44906	before an enemy who, after losing HALF his men, stood as threateningly
 44907	at the end as at the beginning of the battle. The moral force of the
 44908	attacking French army was exhausted. Not that sort of victory which is
 44909	defined by the capture of pieces of material fastened to sticks, called
 44910	standards, and of the ground on which the troops had stood and were
 44911	standing, but a moral victory that convinces the enemy of the moral
 44912	superiority of his opponent and of his own impotence was gained by the
 44913	Russians at BorodinÃ³. The French invaders, like an infuriated animal
 44914	that has in its onslaught received a mortal wound, felt that they were
 44915	perishing, but could not stop, any more than the Russian army, weaker
 44916	by one half, could help swerving. By impetus gained, the French army was
 44917	still able to roll forward to Moscow, but there, without further effort
 44918	on the part of the Russians, it had to perish, bleeding from the mortal
 44919	wound it had received at BorodinÃ³. The direct consequence of the battle
 44920	of BorodinÃ³ was Napoleonâs senseless flight from Moscow, his retreat
 44921	along the old SmolÃ©nsk road, the destruction of the invading army of
 44922	five hundred thousand men, and the downfall of Napoleonic France, on
 44923	which at BorodinÃ³ for the first time the hand of an opponent of stronger
 44924	spirit had been laid.

 44936	CHAPTER I
 44937	
 44938	Absolute continuity of motion is not comprehensible to the human mind.
 44939	Laws of motion of any kind become comprehensible to man only when he
 44940	examines arbitrarily selected elements of that motion; but at the
 44941	same time, a large proportion of human error comes from the arbitrary
 44942	division of continuous motion into discontinuous elements. There is a
 44943	well-known, so-called sophism of the ancients consisting in this, that
 44944	Achilles could never catch up with a tortoise he was following, in spite
 44945	of the fact that he traveled ten times as fast as the tortoise. By
 44946	the time Achilles has covered the distance that separated him from the
 44947	tortoise, the tortoise has covered one tenth of that distance ahead
 44948	of him: when Achilles has covered that tenth, the tortoise has covered
 44949	another one hundredth, and so on forever. This problem seemed to
 44950	the ancients insoluble. The absurd answer (that Achilles could never
 44951	overtake the tortoise) resulted from this: that motion was arbitrarily
 44952	divided into discontinuous elements, whereas the motion both of Achilles
 44953	and of the tortoise was continuous.
 44954	
 44955	By adopting smaller and smaller elements of motion we only approach a
 44956	solution of the problem, but never reach it. Only when we have admitted
 44957	the conception of the infinitely small, and the resulting geometrical
 44958	progression with a common ratio of one tenth, and have found the sum of
 44959	this progression to infinity, do we reach a solution of the problem.
 44960	
 44961	A modern branch of mathematics having achieved the art of dealing with
 44962	the infinitely small can now yield solutions in other more complex
 44963	problems of motion which used to appear insoluble.
 44964	
 44965	This modern branch of mathematics, unknown to the ancients, when dealing
 44966	with problems of motion admits the conception of the infinitely small,
 44967	and so conforms to the chief condition of motion (absolute continuity)
 44968	and thereby corrects the inevitable error which the human mind cannot
 44969	avoid when it deals with separate elements of motion instead of
 44970	examining continuous motion.
 44971	
 44972	In seeking the laws of historical movement just the same thing happens.
 44973	The movement of humanity, arising as it does from innumerable arbitrary
 44974	human wills, is continuous.
 44975	
 44976	To understand the laws of this continuous movement is the aim of
 44977	history. But to arrive at these laws, resulting from the sum of all
 44978	those human wills, manâs mind postulates arbitrary and disconnected
 44979	units. The first method of history is to take an arbitrarily selected
 44980	series of continuous events and examine it apart from others, though
 44981	there is and can be no beginning to any event, for one event always
 44982	flows uninterruptedly from another.
 44983	
 44984	The second method is to consider the actions of some one manâa king or a
 44985	commanderâas equivalent to the sum of many individual wills; whereas the
 44986	sum of individual wills is never expressed by the activity of a single
 44987	historic personage.
 44988	
 44989	Historical science in its endeavor to draw nearer to truth continually
 44990	takes smaller and smaller units for examination. But however small the
 44991	units it takes, we feel that to take any unit disconnected from others,
 44992	or to assume a beginning of any phenomenon, or to say that the will of
 44993	many men is expressed by the actions of any one historic personage, is
 44994	in itself false.
 44995	
 44996	It needs no critical exertion to reduce utterly to dust any deductions
 44997	drawn from history. It is merely necessary to select some larger or
 44998	smaller unit as the subject of observationâas criticism has every
 44999	right to do, seeing that whatever unit history observes must always be
 45000	arbitrarily selected.
 45001	
 45002	Only by taking infinitesimally small units for observation (the
 45003	differential of history, that is, the individual tendencies of men) and
 45004	attaining to the art of integrating them (that is, finding the sum of
 45005	these infinitesimals) can we hope to arrive at the laws of history.
 45006	
 45007	The first fifteen years of the nineteenth century in Europe present an
 45008	extraordinary movement of millions of people. Men leave their customary
 45009	pursuits, hasten from one side of Europe to the other, plunder and
 45010	slaughter one another, triumph and are plunged in despair, and for some
 45011	years the whole course of life is altered and presents an intensive
 45012	movement which first increases and then slackens. What was the cause of
 45013	this movement, by what laws was it governed? asks the mind of man.
 45014	
 45015	The historians, replying to this question, lay before us the sayings and
 45016	doings of a few dozen men in a building in the city of Paris, calling
 45017	these sayings and doings âthe Revolutionâ; then they give a detailed
 45018	biography of Napoleon and of certain people favorable or hostile to him;
 45019	tell of the influence some of these people had on others, and say: that
 45020	is why this movement took place and those are its laws.
 45021	
 45022	But the mind of man not only refuses to believe this explanation, but
 45023	plainly says that this method of explanation is fallacious, because in
 45024	it a weaker phenomenon is taken as the cause of a stronger. The sum of
 45025	human wills produced the Revolution and Napoleon, and only the sum of
 45026	those wills first tolerated and then destroyed them.
 45027	
 45028	âBut every time there have been conquests there have been conquerors;
 45029	every time there has been a revolution in any state there have been
 45030	great men,â says history. And, indeed, human reason replies: every time
 45031	conquerors appear there have been wars, but this does not prove that the
 45032	conquerors caused the wars and that it is possible to find the laws of
 45033	a war in the personal activity of a single man. Whenever I look at my
 45034	watch and its hands point to ten, I hear the bells of the neighboring
 45035	church; but because the bells begin to ring when the hands of the clock
 45036	reach ten, I have no right to assume that the movement of the bells is
 45037	caused by the position of the hands of the watch.
 45038	
 45039	Whenever I see the movement of a locomotive I hear the whistle and see
 45040	the valves opening and wheels turning; but I have no right to conclude
 45041	that the whistling and the turning of wheels are the cause of the
 45042	movement of the engine.
 45043	
 45044	The peasants say that a cold wind blows in late spring because the oaks
 45045	are budding, and really every spring cold winds do blow when the oak
 45046	is budding. But though I do not know what causes the cold winds to blow
 45047	when the oak buds unfold, I cannot agree with the peasants that the
 45048	unfolding of the oak buds is the cause of the cold wind, for the
 45049	force of the wind is beyond the influence of the buds. I see only a
 45050	coincidence of occurrences such as happens with all the phenomena of
 45051	life, and I see that however much and however carefully I observe the
 45052	hands of the watch, and the valves and wheels of the engine, and the
 45053	oak, I shall not discover the cause of the bells ringing, the engine
 45054	moving, or of the winds of spring. To that I must entirely change my
 45055	point of view and study the laws of the movement of steam, of the
 45056	bells, and of the wind. History must do the same. And attempts in this
 45057	direction have already been made.
 45058	
 45059	To study the laws of history we must completely change the subject of
 45060	our observation, must leave aside kings, ministers, and generals, and
 45061	study the common, infinitesimally small elements by which the masses are
 45062	moved. No one can say in how far it is possible for man to advance
 45063	in this way toward an understanding of the laws of history; but it is
 45064	evident that only along that path does the possibility of discovering
 45065	the laws of history lie, and that as yet not a millionth part as much
 45066	mental effort has been applied in this direction by historians as has
 45067	been devoted to describing the actions of various kings, commanders,
 45068	and ministers and propounding the historiansâ own reflections concerning
 45069	these actions.

 45075	CHAPTER II
 45076	
 45077	The forces of a dozen European nations burst into Russia. The Russian
 45078	army and people avoided a collision till SmolÃ©nsk was reached, and again
 45079	from SmolÃ©nsk to BorodinÃ³. The French army pushed on to Moscow, its
 45080	goal, its impetus ever increasing as it neared its aim, just as the
 45081	velocity of a falling body increases as it approaches the earth. Behind
 45082	it were seven hundred miles of hunger-stricken, hostile country; ahead
 45083	were a few dozen miles separating it from its goal. Every soldier in
 45084	Napoleonâs army felt this and the invasion moved on by its own momentum.
 45085	
 45086	The more the Russian army retreated the more fiercely a spirit of hatred
 45087	of the enemy flared up, and while it retreated the army increased and
 45088	consolidated. At BorodinÃ³ a collision took place. Neither army was
 45089	broken up, but the Russian army retreated immediately after the
 45090	collision as inevitably as a ball recoils after colliding with another
 45091	having a greater momentum, and with equal inevitability the ball
 45092	of invasion that had advanced with such momentum rolled on for some
 45093	distance, though the collision had deprived it of all its force.
 45094	
 45095	The Russians retreated eighty milesâto beyond Moscowâand the French
 45096	reached Moscow and there came to a standstill. For five weeks after that
 45097	there was not a single battle. The French did not move. As a bleeding,
 45098	mortally wounded animal licks its wounds, they remained inert in Moscow
 45099	for five weeks, and then suddenly, with no fresh reason, fled back:
 45100	they made a dash for the KalÃºga road, and (after a victoryâfor at
 45101	MÃ¡lo-YaroslÃ¡vets the field of conflict again remained theirs) without
 45102	undertaking a single serious battle, they fled still more rapidly back
 45103	to SmolÃ©nsk, beyond SmolÃ©nsk, beyond the BerÃ«zina, beyond VÃ­lna, and
 45104	farther still.
 45105	
 45106	On the evening of the twenty-sixth of August, KutÃºzov and the whole
 45107	Russian army were convinced that the battle of BorodinÃ³ was a victory.
 45108	KutÃºzov reported so to the Emperor. He gave orders to prepare for a
 45109	fresh conflict to finish the enemy and did this not to deceive anyone,
 45110	but because he knew that the enemy was beaten, as everyone who had taken
 45111	part in the battle knew it.
 45112	
 45113	But all that evening and next day reports came in one after another
 45114	of unheard-of losses, of the loss of half the army, and a fresh battle
 45115	proved physically impossible.
 45116	
 45117	It was impossible to give battle before information had been collected,
 45118	the wounded gathered in, the supplies of ammunition replenished, the
 45119	slain reckoned up, new officers appointed to replace those who had been
 45120	killed, and before the men had had food and sleep. And meanwhile, the
 45121	very next morning after the battle, the French army advanced of itself
 45122	upon the Russians, carried forward by the force of its own momentum now
 45123	seemingly increased in inverse proportion to the square of the distance
 45124	from its aim. KutÃºzovâs wish was to attack next day, and the whole
 45125	army desired to do so. But to make an attack the wish to do so is not
 45126	sufficient, there must also be a possibility of doing it, and that
 45127	possibility did not exist. It was impossible not to retreat a dayâs
 45128	march, and then in the same way it was impossible not to retreat another
 45129	and a third dayâs march, and at last, on the first of September when
 45130	the army drew near Moscowâdespite the strength of the feeling that had
 45131	arisen in all ranksâthe force of circumstances compelled it to retire
 45132	beyond Moscow. And the troops retired one more, last, dayâs march, and
 45133	abandoned Moscow to the enemy.
 45134	
 45135	For people accustomed to think that plans of campaign and battles are
 45136	made by generalsâas anyone of us sitting over a map in his study may
 45137	imagine how he would have arranged things in this or that battleâthe
 45138	questions present themselves: Why did KutÃºzov during the retreat not do
 45139	this or that? Why did he not take up a position before reaching FilÃ­?
 45140	Why did he not retire at once by the KalÃºga road, abandoning Moscow? and
 45141	so on. People accustomed to think in that way forget, or do not know,
 45142	the inevitable conditions which always limit the activities of any
 45143	commander in chief. The activity of a commander in chief does not at all
 45144	resemble the activity we imagine to ourselves when we sit at ease in
 45145	our studies examining some campaign on the map, with a certain number of
 45146	troops on this and that side in a certain known locality, and begin our
 45147	plans from some given moment. A commander in chief is never dealing with
 45148	the beginning of any eventâthe position from which we always contemplate
 45149	it. The commander in chief is always in the midst of a series of
 45150	shifting events and so he never can at any moment consider the whole
 45151	import of an event that is occurring. Moment by moment the event is
 45152	imperceptibly shaping itself, and at every moment of this continuous,
 45153	uninterrupted shaping of events the commander in chief is in the
 45154	midst of a most complex play of intrigues, worries, contingencies,
 45155	authorities, projects, counsels, threats, and deceptions and is
 45156	continually obliged to reply to innumerable questions addressed to him,
 45157	which constantly conflict with one another.
 45158	
 45159	Learned military authorities quite seriously tell us that KutÃºzov should
 45160	have moved his army to the KalÃºga road long before reaching FilÃ­, and
 45161	that somebody actually submitted such a proposal to him. But a commander
 45162	in chief, especially at a difficult moment, has always before him not
 45163	one proposal but dozens simultaneously. And all these proposals, based
 45164	on strategics and tactics, contradict each other.
 45165	
 45166	A commander in chiefâs business, it would seem, is simply to choose one
 45167	of these projects. But even that he cannot do. Events and time do not
 45168	wait. For instance, on the twenty-eighth it is suggested to him to
 45169	cross to the KalÃºga road, but just then an adjutant gallops up from
 45170	MilorÃ¡dovich asking whether he is to engage the French or retire. An
 45171	order must be given him at once, that instant. And the order to retreat
 45172	carries us past the turn to the KalÃºga road. And after the adjutant
 45173	comes the commissary general asking where the stores are to be taken,
 45174	and the chief of the hospitals asks where the wounded are to go, and a
 45175	courier from Petersburg brings a letter from the sovereign which does
 45176	not admit of the possibility of abandoning Moscow, and the commander in
 45177	chiefâs rival, the man who is undermining him (and there are always
 45178	not merely one but several such), presents a new project diametrically
 45179	opposed to that of turning to the KalÃºga road, and the commander in
 45180	chief himself needs sleep and refreshment to maintain his energy and
 45181	a respectable general who has been overlooked in the distribution of
 45182	rewards comes to complain, and the inhabitants of the district pray to
 45183	be defended, and an officer sent to inspect the locality comes in and
 45184	gives a report quite contrary to what was said by the officer
 45185	previously sent; and a spy, a prisoner, and a general who has been
 45186	on reconnaissance, all describe the position of the enemyâs army
 45187	differently. People accustomed to misunderstand or to forget these
 45188	inevitable conditions of a commander in chiefâs actions describe to
 45189	us, for instance, the position of the army at FilÃ­ and assume that the
 45190	commander in chief could, on the first of September, quite freely decide
 45191	whether to abandon Moscow or defend it; whereas, with the Russian army
 45192	less than four miles from Moscow, no such question existed. When had
 45193	that question been settled? At Drissa and at SmolÃ©nsk and most
 45194	palpably of all on the twenty-fourth of August at ShevÃ¡rdino and on
 45195	the twenty-sixth at BorodinÃ³, and each day and hour and minute of the
 45196	retreat from BorodinÃ³ to FilÃ­.

 45198

 45201	
 45202	CHAPTER III
 45203	
 45204	When ErmÃ³lov, having been sent by KutÃºzov to inspect the position, told
 45205	the field marshal that it was impossible to fight there before Moscow
 45206	and that they must retreat, KutÃºzov looked at him in silence.
 45207	
 45208	âGive me your hand,â said he and, turning it over so as to feel the
 45209	pulse, added: âYou are not well, my dear fellow. Think what you are
 45210	saying!â
 45211	
 45212	KutÃºzov could not yet admit the possibility of retreating beyond Moscow
 45213	without a battle.
 45214	
 45215	On the PoklÃ³nny Hill, four miles from the DorogomÃ­lov gate of Moscow,
 45216	KutÃºzov got out of his carriage and sat down on a bench by the roadside.
 45217	A great crowd of generals gathered round him, and Count RostopchÃ­n, who
 45218	had come out from Moscow, joined them. This brilliant company separated
 45219	into several groups who all discussed the advantages and disadvantages
 45220	of the position, the state of the army, the plans suggested, the
 45221	situation of Moscow, and military questions generally. Though they had
 45222	not been summoned for the purpose, and though it was not so called, they
 45223	all felt that this was really a council of war. The conversations all
 45224	dealt with public questions. If anyone gave or asked for personal
 45225	news, it was done in a whisper and they immediately reverted to general
 45226	matters. No jokes, or laughter, or smiles even, were seen among all
 45227	these men. They evidently all made an effort to hold themselves at the
 45228	height the situation demanded. And all these groups, while talking
 45229	among themselves, tried to keep near the commander in chief (whose
 45230	bench formed the center of the gathering) and to speak so that he might
 45231	overhear them. The commander in chief listened to what was being said
 45232	and sometimes asked them to repeat their remarks, but did not himself
 45233	take part in the conversations or express any opinion. After hearing
 45234	what was being said by one or other of these groups he generally turned
 45235	away with an air of disappointment, as though they were not speaking of
 45236	anything he wished to hear. Some discussed the position that had been
 45237	chosen, criticizing not the position itself so much as the mental
 45238	capacity of those who had chosen it. Others argued that a mistake had
 45239	been made earlier and that a battle should have been fought two days
 45240	before. Others again spoke of the battle of Salamanca, which was
 45241	described by Crosart, a newly arrived Frenchman in a Spanish uniform.
 45242	(This Frenchman and one of the German princes serving with the Russian
 45243	army were discussing the siege of Saragossa and considering the
 45244	possibility of defending Moscow in a similar manner.) Count RostopchÃ­n
 45245	was telling a fourth group that he was prepared to die with the city
 45246	train bands under the walls of the capital, but that he still could not
 45247	help regretting having been left in ignorance of what was happening, and
 45248	that had he known it sooner things would have been different.... A
 45249	fifth group, displaying the profundity of their strategic perceptions,
 45250	discussed the direction the troops would now have to take. A sixth group
 45251	was talking absolute nonsense. KutÃºzovâs expression grew more and more
 45252	preoccupied and gloomy. From all this talk he saw only one thing: that
 45253	to defend Moscow was a physical impossibility in the full meaning of
 45254	those words, that is to say, so utterly impossible that if any senseless
 45255	commander were to give orders to fight, confusion would result but the
 45256	battle would still not take place. It would not take place because the
 45257	commanders not merely all recognized the position to be impossible, but
 45258	in their conversations were only discussing what would happen after its
 45259	inevitable abandonment. How could the commanders lead their troops to
 45260	a field of battle they considered impossible to hold? The lower-grade
 45261	officers and even the soldiers (who too reason) also considered the
 45262	position impossible and therefore could not go to fight, fully convinced
 45263	as they were of defeat. If Bennigsen insisted on the position being
 45264	defended and others still discussed it, the question was no longer
 45265	important in itself but only as a pretext for disputes and intrigue.
 45266	This KutÃºzov knew well.
 45267	
 45268	Bennigsen, who had chosen the position, warmly displayed his Russian
 45269	patriotism (KutÃºzov could not listen to this without wincing) by
 45270	insisting that Moscow must be defended. His aim was as clear as daylight
 45271	to KutÃºzov: if the defense failed, to throw the blame on KutÃºzov who had
 45272	brought the army as far as the Sparrow Hills without giving battle; if
 45273	it succeeded, to claim the success as his own; or if battle were not
 45274	given, to clear himself of the crime of abandoning Moscow. But this
 45275	intrigue did not now occupy the old manâs mind. One terrible question
 45276	absorbed him and to that question he heard no reply from anyone. The
 45277	question for him now was: âHave I really allowed Napoleon to reach
 45278	Moscow, and when did I do so? When was it decided? Can it have been
 45279	yesterday when I ordered PlÃ¡tov to retreat, or was it the evening
 45280	before, when I had a nap and told Bennigsen to issue orders? Or was it
 45281	earlier still?... When, when was this terrible affair decided? Moscow
 45282	must be abandoned. The army must retreat and the order to do so must
 45283	be given.â To give that terrible order seemed to him equivalent to
 45284	resigning the command of the army. And not only did he love power to
 45285	which he was accustomed (the honours awarded to Prince ProzorÃ³vski,
 45286	under whom he had served in Turkey, galled him), but he was convinced
 45287	that he was destined to save Russia and that that was why, against
 45288	the Emperorâs wish and by the will of the people, he had been chosen
 45289	commander in chief. He was convinced that he alone could maintain
 45290	command of the army in these difficult circumstances, and that in all
 45291	the world he alone could encounter the invincible Napoleon without fear,
 45292	and he was horrified at the thought of the order he had to issue. But
 45293	something had to be decided, and these conversations around him which
 45294	were assuming too free a character must be stopped.
 45295	
 45296	He called the most important generals to him.
 45297	
 45298	âMy head, be it good or bad, must depend on itself,â said he, rising
 45299	from the bench, and he rode to FilÃ­ where his carriages were waiting.

 45305	CHAPTER IV
 45306	
 45307	The Council of War began to assemble at two in the afternoon in the
 45308	better and roomier part of Andrew SavostyÃ¡novâs hut. The men, women, and
 45309	children of the large peasant family crowded into the back room across
 45310	the passage. Only MalÃ¡sha, Andrewâs six-year-old granddaughter whom
 45311	his Serene Highness had petted and to whom he had given a lump of sugar
 45312	while drinking his tea, remained on the top of the brick oven in the
 45313	larger room. MalÃ¡sha looked down from the oven with shy delight at the
 45314	faces, uniforms, and decorations of the generals, who one after another
 45315	came into the room and sat down on the broad benches in the corner
 45316	under the icons. âGranddadâ himself, as MalÃ¡sha in her own mind called
 45317	KutÃºzov, sat apart in a dark corner behind the oven. He sat, sunk deep
 45318	in a folding armchair, and continually cleared his throat and pulled at
 45319	the collar of his coat which, though it was unbuttoned, still seemed
 45320	to pinch his neck. Those who entered went up one by one to the field
 45321	marshal; he pressed the hands of some and nodded to others. His adjutant
 45322	KaysÃ¡rov was about to draw back the curtain of the window facing
 45323	KutÃºzov, but the latter moved his hand angrily and KaysÃ¡rov understood
 45324	that his Serene Highness did not wish his face to be seen.
 45325	
 45326	Round the peasantâs deal table, on which lay maps, plans, pencils, and
 45327	papers, so many people gathered that the orderlies brought in another
 45328	bench and put it beside the table. ErmÃ³lov, KaysÃ¡rov, and Toll, who had
 45329	just arrived, sat down on this bench. In the foremost place, immediately
 45330	under the icons, sat Barclay de Tolly, his high forehead merging into
 45331	his bald crown. He had a St. Georgeâs Cross round his neck and looked
 45332	pale and ill. He had been feverish for two days and was now shivering
 45333	and in pain. Beside him sat UvÃ¡rov, who with rapid gesticulations was
 45334	giving him some information, speaking in low tones as they all did.
 45335	Chubby little DokhtÃºrov was listening attentively with eyebrows
 45336	raised and arms folded on his stomach. On the other side sat Count
 45337	Ostermann-TolstÃ³y, seemingly absorbed in his own thoughts. His broad
 45338	head with its bold features and glittering eyes was resting on his hand.
 45339	RaÃ©vski, twitching forward the black hair on his temples as was his
 45340	habit, glanced now at KutÃºzov and now at the door with a look of
 45341	impatience. KonovnÃ­tsynâs firm, handsome, and kindly face was lit up by
 45342	a tender, sly smile. His glance met MalÃ¡shaâs, and the expression of his
 45343	eyes caused the little girl to smile.
 45344	
 45345	They were all waiting for Bennigsen, who on the pretext of inspecting
 45346	the position was finishing his savory dinner. They waited for him from
 45347	four till six oâclock and did not begin their deliberations all that
 45348	time but talked in low tones of other matters.
 45349	
 45350	Only when Bennigsen had entered the hut did KutÃºzov leave his corner and
 45351	draw toward the table, but not near enough for the candles that had been
 45352	placed there to light up his face.
 45353	
 45354	Bennigsen opened the council with the question: âAre we to abandon
 45355	Russiaâs ancient and sacred capital without a struggle, or are we to
 45356	defend it?â A prolonged and general silence followed. There was a frown
 45357	on every face and only KutÃºzovâs angry grunts and occasional cough
 45358	broke the silence. All eyes were gazing at him. MalÃ¡sha too looked at
 45359	âGranddad.â She was nearest to him and saw how his face puckered; he
 45360	seemed about to cry, but this did not last long.
 45361	
 45362	âRussiaâs ancient and sacred capital!â he suddenly said, repeating
 45363	Bennigsenâs words in an angry voice and thereby drawing attention to the
 45364	false note in them. âAllow me to tell you, your excellency, that that
 45365	question has no meaning for a Russian.â (He lurched his heavy body
 45366	forward.) âSuch a question cannot be put; it is senseless! The question
 45367	I have asked these gentlemen to meet to discuss is a military one.
 45368	The question is that of saving Russia. Is it better to give up Moscow
 45369	without a battle, or by accepting battle to risk losing the army as well
 45370	as Moscow? That is the question on which I want your opinion,â and he
 45371	sank back in his chair.
 45372	
 45373	The discussion began. Bennigsen did not yet consider his game lost.
 45374	Admitting the view of Barclay and others that a defensive battle at
 45375	FilÃ­ was impossible, but imbued with Russian patriotism and the love
 45376	of Moscow, he proposed to move troops from the right to the left flank
 45377	during the night and attack the French right flank the following day.
 45378	Opinions were divided, and arguments were advanced for and against that
 45379	project. ErmÃ³lov, DokhtÃºrov, and RaÃ©vski agreed with Bennigsen. Whether
 45380	feeling it necessary to make a sacrifice before abandoning the capital
 45381	or guided by other, personal considerations, these generals seemed not
 45382	to understand that this council could not alter the inevitable course
 45383	of events and that Moscow was in effect already abandoned. The other
 45384	generals, however, understood it and, leaving aside the question of
 45385	Moscow, spoke of the direction the army should take in its retreat.
 45386	MalÃ¡sha, who kept her eyes fixed on what was going on before her,
 45387	understood the meaning of the council differently. It seemed to her that
 45388	it was only a personal struggle between âGranddadâ and âLong-coatâ as
 45389	she termed Bennigsen. She saw that they grew spiteful when they spoke to
 45390	one another, and in her heart she sided with âGranddad.â In the midst of
 45391	the conversation she noticed âGranddadâ give Bennigsen a quick, subtle
 45392	glance, and then to her joys she saw that âGranddadâ said something to
 45393	âLong-coatâ which settled him. Bennigsen suddenly reddened and paced
 45394	angrily up and down the room. What so affected him was KutÃºzovâs calm
 45395	and quiet comment on the advantage or disadvantage of Bennigsenâs
 45396	proposal to move troops by night from the right to the left flank to
 45397	attack the French right wing.
 45398	
 45399	âGentlemen,â said KutÃºzov, âI cannot approve of the countâs plan. Moving
 45400	troops in close proximity to an enemy is always dangerous, and military
 45401	history supports that view. For instance...â KutÃºzov seemed to reflect,
 45402	searching for an example, then with a clear, naÃ¯ve look at Bennigsen he
 45403	added: âOh yes; take the battle of Friedland, which I think the count
 45404	well remembers, and which was... not fully successful, only because our
 45405	troops were rearranged too near the enemy....â
 45406	
 45407	There followed a momentary pause, which seemed very long to them all.
 45408	
 45409	The discussion recommenced, but pauses frequently occurred and they all
 45410	felt that there was no more to be said.
 45411	
 45412	During one of these pauses KutÃºzov heaved a deep sigh as if preparing to
 45413	speak. They all looked at him.
 45414	
 45415	âWell, gentlemen, I see that it is I who will have to pay for the broken
 45416	crockery,â said he, and rising slowly he moved to the table. âGentlemen,
 45417	I have heard your views. Some of you will not agree with me. But I,â he
 45418	paused, âby the authority entrusted to me by my Sovereign and country,
 45419	order a retreat.â
 45420	
 45421	After that the generals began to disperse with the solemnity and
 45422	circumspect silence of people who are leaving, after a funeral.
 45423	
 45424	Some of the generals, in low tones and in a strain very different from
 45425	the way they had spoken during the council, communicated something to
 45426	their commander in chief.
 45427	
 45428	MalÃ¡sha, who had long been expected for supper, climbed carefully
 45429	backwards down from the oven, her bare little feet catching at its
 45430	projections, and slipping between the legs of the generals she darted
 45431	out of the room.
 45432	
 45433	When he had dismissed the generals KutÃºzov sat a long time with his
 45434	elbows on the table, thinking always of the same terrible question:
 45435	âWhen, when did the abandonment of Moscow become inevitable? When was
 45436	that done which settled the matter? And who was to blame for it?â
 45437	
 45438	âI did not expect this,â said he to his adjutant Schneider when the
 45439	latter came in late that night. âI did not expect this! I did not think
 45440	this would happen.â
 45441	
 45442	âYou should take some rest, your Serene Highness,â replied Schneider.
 45443	
 45444	âBut no! They shall eat horseflesh yet, like the Turks!â exclaimed
 45445	KutÃºzov without replying, striking the table with his podgy fist. âThey
 45446	shall too, if only...â
 45447	
 45448	
 45449	
 45450	
 45451	
 45452	CHAPTER V
 45453	
 45454	At that very time, in circumstances even more important than retreating
 45455	without a battle, namely the evacuation and burning of Moscow,
 45456	RostopchÃ­n, who is usually represented as being the instigator of that
 45457	event, acted in an altogether different manner from KutÃºzov.
 45458	
 45459	After the battle of BorodinÃ³ the abandonment and burning of Moscow was
 45460	as inevitable as the retreat of the army beyond Moscow without fighting.
 45461	
 45462	Every Russian might have predicted it, not by reasoning but by the
 45463	feeling implanted in each of us and in our fathers.
 45464	
 45465	The same thing that took place in Moscow had happened in all the towns
 45466	and villages on Russian soil beginning with SmolÃ©nsk, without the
 45467	participation of Count RostopchÃ­n and his broadsheets. The people
 45468	awaited the enemy unconcernedly, did not riot or become excited or tear
 45469	anyone to pieces, but faced its fate, feeling within it the strength to
 45470	find what it should do at that most difficult moment. And as soon as the
 45471	enemy drew near the wealthy classes went away abandoning their property,
 45472	while the poorer remained and burned and destroyed what was left.
 45473	
 45474	The consciousness that this would be so and would always be so was and
 45475	is present in the heart of every Russian. And a consciousness of this,
 45476	and a foreboding that Moscow would be taken, was present in Russian
 45477	Moscow society in 1812. Those who had quitted Moscow already in July
 45478	and at the beginning of August showed that they expected this. Those who
 45479	went away, taking what they could and abandoning their houses and half
 45480	their belongings, did so from the latent patriotism which expresses
 45481	itself not by phrases or by giving oneâs children to save the fatherland
 45482	and similar unnatural exploits, but unobtrusively, simply, organically,
 45483	and therefore in the way that always produces the most powerful results.
 45484	
 45485	âIt is disgraceful to run away from danger; only cowards are running
 45486	away from Moscow,â they were told. In his broadsheets RostopchÃ­n
 45487	impressed on them that to leave Moscow was shameful. They were ashamed
 45488	to be called cowards, ashamed to leave, but still they left, knowing
 45489	it had to be done. Why did they go? It is impossible to suppose that
 45490	RostopchÃ­n had scared them by his accounts of horrors Napoleon had
 45491	committed in conquered countries. The first people to go away were the
 45492	rich educated people who knew quite well that Vienna and Berlin had
 45493	remained intact and that during Napoleonâs occupation the inhabitants
 45494	had spent their time pleasantly in the company of the charming Frenchmen
 45495	whom the Russians, and especially the Russian ladies, then liked so
 45496	much.
 45497	
 45498	They went away because for Russians there could be no question as to
 45499	whether things would go well or ill under French rule in Moscow. It was
 45500	out of the question to be under French rule, it would be the worst thing
 45501	that could happen. They went away even before the battle of BorodinÃ³ and
 45502	still more rapidly after it, despite RostopchÃ­nâs calls to defend Moscow
 45503	or the announcement of his intention to take the wonder-working icon of
 45504	the Iberian Mother of God and go to fight, or of the balloons that were
 45505	to destroy the French, and despite all the nonsense RostopchÃ­n wrote in
 45506	his broadsheets. They knew that it was for the army to fight, and that
 45507	if it could not succeed it would not do to take young ladies and house
 45508	serfs to the Three Hills quarter of Moscow to fight Napoleon, and that
 45509	they must go away, sorry as they were to abandon their property
 45510	to destruction. They went away without thinking of the tremendous
 45511	significance of that immense and wealthy city being given over to
 45512	destruction, for a great city with wooden buildings was certain when
 45513	abandoned by its inhabitants to be burned. They went away each on his
 45514	own account, and yet it was only in consequence of their going away
 45515	that the momentous event was accomplished that will always remain the
 45516	greatest glory of the Russian people. The lady who, afraid of being
 45517	stopped by Count RostopchÃ­nâs orders, had already in June moved with her
 45518	Negroes and her women jesters from Moscow to her SarÃ¡tov estate, with
 45519	a vague consciousness that she was not Bonaparteâs servant, was really,
 45520	simply, and truly carrying out the great work which saved Russia. But
 45521	Count RostopchÃ­n, who now taunted those who left Moscow and now had the
 45522	government offices removed; now distributed quite useless weapons to
 45523	the drunken rabble; now had processions displaying the icons, and now
 45524	forbade Father Augustin to remove icons or the relics of saints; now
 45525	seized all the private carts in Moscow and on one hundred and thirty-six
 45526	of them removed the balloon that was being constructed by Leppich; now
 45527	hinted that he would burn Moscow and related how he had set fire to his
 45528	own house; now wrote a proclamation to the French solemnly upbraiding
 45529	them for having destroyed his Orphanage; now claimed the glory of
 45530	having hinted that he would burn Moscow and now repudiated the deed;
 45531	now ordered the people to catch all spies and bring them to him, and now
 45532	reproached them for doing so; now expelled all the French residents from
 45533	Moscow, and now allowed Madame Aubert-ChalmÃ© (the center of the whole
 45534	French colony in Moscow) to remain, but ordered the venerable old
 45535	postmaster KlyucharÃ«v to be arrested and exiled for no particular
 45536	offense; now assembled the people at the Three Hills to fight the French
 45537	and now, to get rid of them, handed over to them a man to be killed
 45538	and himself drove away by a back gate; now declared that he would
 45539	not survive the fall of Moscow, and now wrote French verses in albums
 45540	concerning his share in the affairâthis man did not understand the
 45541	meaning of what was happening but merely wanted to do something himself
 45542	that would astonish people, to perform some patriotically heroic
 45543	feat; and like a child he made sport of the momentous, and unavoidable
 45544	eventâthe abandonment and burning of Moscowâand tried with his puny hand
 45545	now to speed and now to stay the enormous, popular tide that bore him
 45546	along with it.
 45547	
 45548	
 45549	
 45550	
 45551	
 45552	CHAPTER VI
 45553	
 45554	HÃ©lÃ¨ne, having returned with the court from VÃ­lna to Petersburg, found
 45555	herself in a difficult position.
 45556	
 45557	In Petersburg she had enjoyed the special protection of a grandee who
 45558	occupied one of the highest posts in the Empire. In VÃ­lna she had formed
 45559	an intimacy with a young foreign prince. When she returned to Petersburg
 45560	both the magnate and the prince were there, and both claimed their
 45561	rights. HÃ©lÃ¨ne was faced by a new problemâhow to preserve her intimacy
 45562	with both without offending either.
 45563	
 45564	What would have seemed difficult or even impossible to another woman did
 45565	not cause the least embarrassment to Countess BezÃºkhova, who evidently
 45566	deserved her reputation of being a very clever woman. Had she attempted
 45567	concealment, or tried to extricate herself from her awkward position
 45568	by cunning, she would have spoiled her case by acknowledging herself
 45569	guilty. But HÃ©lÃ¨ne, like a really great man who can do whatever
 45570	he pleases, at once assumed her own position to be correct, as she
 45571	sincerely believed it to be, and that everyone else was to blame.
 45572	
 45573	The first time the young foreigner allowed himself to reproach her, she
 45574	lifted her beautiful head and, half turning to him, said firmly: âThatâs
 45575	just like a manâselfish and cruel! I expected nothing else. A woman
 45576	sacrifices herself for you, she suffers, and this is her reward! What
 45577	right have you, monseigneur, to demand an account of my attachments and
 45578	friendships? He is a man who has been more than a father to me!â The
 45579	prince was about to say something, but HÃ©lÃ¨ne interrupted him.
 45580	
 45581	âWell, yes,â said she, âit may be that he has other sentiments for me
 45582	than those of a father, but that is not a reason for me to shut my door
 45583	on him. I am not a man, that I should repay kindness with ingratitude!
 45584	Know, monseigneur, that in all that relates to my intimate feelings I
 45585	render account only to God and to my conscience,â she concluded, laying
 45586	her hand on her beautiful, fully expanded bosom and looking up to
 45587	heaven.
 45588	
 45589	âBut for heavenâs sake listen to me!â
 45590	
 45591	âMarry me, and I will be your slave!â
 45592	
 45593	âBut thatâs impossible.â
 45594	
 45595	âYou wonât deign to demean yourself by marrying me, you...â said HÃ©lÃ¨ne,
 45596	beginning to cry.
 45597	
 45598	The prince tried to comfort her, but HÃ©lÃ¨ne, as if quite distraught,
 45599	said through her tears that there was nothing to prevent her marrying,
 45600	that there were precedents (there were up to that time very few, but
 45601	she mentioned Napoleon and some other exalted personages), that she had
 45602	never been her husbandâs wife, and that she had been sacrificed.
 45603	
 45604	âBut the law, religion...â said the prince, already yielding.
 45605	
 45606	âThe law, religion... What have they been invented for if they canât
 45607	arrange that?â said HÃ©lÃ¨ne.
 45608	
 45609	The prince was surprised that so simple an idea had not occurred to him,
 45610	and he applied for advice to the holy brethren of the Society of Jesus,
 45611	with whom he was on intimate terms.
 45612	
 45613	A few days later at one of those enchanting fetes which HÃ©lÃ¨ne gave at
 45614	her country house on the Stone Island, the charming Monsieur de Jobert,
 45615	a man no longer young, with snow white hair and brilliant black eyes,
 45616	a Jesuit Ã  robe courte * was presented to her, and in the garden by the
 45617	light of the illuminations and to the sound of music talked to her for a
 45618	long time of the love of God, of Christ, of the Sacred Heart, and of the
 45619	consolations the one true Catholic religion affords in this world and
 45620	the next. HÃ©lÃ¨ne was touched, and more than once tears rose to her eyes
 45621	and to those of Monsieur de Jobert and their voices trembled. A dance,
 45622	for which her partner came to seek her, put an end to her discourse with
 45623	her future directeur de conscience, but the next evening Monsieur de
 45624	Jobert came to see HÃ©lÃ¨ne when she was alone, and after that often came
 45625	again.
 45626	
 45627	    * Lay member of the Society of Jesus.
 45628	
 45629	One day he took the countess to a Roman Catholic church, where she knelt
 45630	down before the altar to which she was led. The enchanting, middle-aged
 45631	Frenchman laid his hands on her head and, as she herself afterward
 45632	described it, she felt something like a fresh breeze wafted into her
 45633	soul. It was explained to her that this was la grÃ¢ce.
 45634	
 45635	After that a long-frocked abbÃ© was brought to her. She confessed to
 45636	him, and he absolved her from her sins. Next day she received a box
 45637	containing the Sacred Host, which was left at her house for her to
 45638	partake of. A few days later HÃ©lÃ¨ne learned with pleasure that she had
 45639	now been admitted to the true Catholic Church and that in a few days the
 45640	Pope himself would hear of her and would send her a certain document.
 45641	
 45642	All that was done around her and to her at this time, all the attention
 45643	devoted to her by so many clever men and expressed in such pleasant,
 45644	refined ways, and the state of dove-like purity she was now in (she wore
 45645	only white dresses and white ribbons all that time) gave her pleasure,
 45646	but her pleasure did not cause her for a moment to forget her aim. And
 45647	as it always happens in contests of cunning that a stupid person gets
 45648	the better of cleverer ones, HÃ©lÃ¨neâhaving realized that the main object
 45649	of all these words and all this trouble was, after converting her to
 45650	Catholicism, to obtain money from her for Jesuit institutions (as to
 45651	which she received indications)âbefore parting with her money insisted
 45652	that the various operations necessary to free her from her husband
 45653	should be performed. In her view the aim of every religion was merely
 45654	to preserve certain proprieties while affording satisfaction to
 45655	human desires. And with this aim, in one of her talks with her Father
 45656	Confessor, she insisted on an answer to the question, in how far was she
 45657	bound by her marriage?
 45658	
 45659	They were sitting in the twilight by a window in the drawing room.
 45660	The scent of flowers came in at the window. HÃ©lÃ¨ne was wearing a white
 45661	dress, transparent over her shoulders and bosom. The abbÃ©, a well-fed
 45662	man with a plump, clean-shaven chin, a pleasant firm mouth, and white
 45663	hands meekly folded on his knees, sat close to HÃ©lÃ¨ne and, with a
 45664	subtle smile on his lips and a peaceful look of delight at her beauty,
 45665	occasionally glanced at her face as he explained his opinion on the
 45666	subject. HÃ©lÃ¨ne with an uneasy smile looked at his curly hair and his
 45667	plump, clean-shaven, blackish cheeks and every moment expected the
 45668	conversation to take a fresh turn. But the abbÃ©, though he evidently
 45669	enjoyed the beauty of his companion, was absorbed in his mastery of the
 45670	matter.
 45671	
 45672	The course of the Father Confessorâs arguments ran as follows: âIgnorant
 45673	of the import of what you were undertaking, you made a vow of conjugal
 45674	fidelity to a man who on his part, by entering the married state without
 45675	faith in the religious significance of marriage, committed an act of
 45676	sacrilege. That marriage lacked the dual significance it should have
 45677	had. Yet in spite of this your vow was binding. You swerved from it.
 45678	What did you commit by so acting? A venial, or a mortal, sin? A venial
 45679	sin, for you acted without evil intention. If now you married again
 45680	with the object of bearing children, your sin might be forgiven. But the
 45681	question is again a twofold one: firstly...â
 45682	
 45683	But suddenly HÃ©lÃ¨ne, who was getting bored, said with one of her
 45684	bewitching smiles: âBut I think that having espoused the true religion I
 45685	cannot be bound by what a false religion laid upon me.â
 45686	
 45687	The director of her conscience was astounded at having the case
 45688	presented to him thus with the simplicity of Columbusâ egg. He was
 45689	delighted at the unexpected rapidity of his pupilâs progress, but could
 45690	not abandon the edifice of argument he had laboriously constructed.
 45691	
 45692	âLet us understand one another, Countess,â said he with a smile, and
 45693	began refuting his spiritual daughterâs arguments.
 45694	
 45695	
 45696	
 45697	
 45698	
 45699	CHAPTER VII
 45700	
 45701	HÃ©lÃ¨ne understood that the question was very simple and easy from
 45702	the ecclesiastical point of view, and that her directors were making
 45703	difficulties only because they were apprehensive as to how the matter
 45704	would be regarded by the secular authorities.
 45705	
 45706	So she decided that it was necessary to prepare the opinion of society.
 45707	She provoked the jealousy of the elderly magnate and told him what she
 45708	had told her other suitor; that is, she put the matter so that the only
 45709	way for him to obtain a right over her was to marry her. The elderly
 45710	magnate was at first as much taken aback by this suggestion of marriage
 45711	with a woman whose husband was alive, as the younger man had been, but
 45712	HÃ©lÃ¨neâs imperturbable conviction that it was as simple and natural as
 45713	marrying a maiden had its effect on him too. Had HÃ©lÃ¨ne herself shown
 45714	the least sign of hesitation, shame, or secrecy, her cause would
 45715	certainly have been lost; but not only did she show no signs of secrecy
 45716	or shame, on the contrary, with good-natured naÃ¯vetÃ© she told her
 45717	intimate friends (and these were all Petersburg) that both the prince
 45718	and the magnate had proposed to her and that she loved both and was
 45719	afraid of grieving either.
 45720	
 45721	A rumor immediately spread in Petersburg, not that HÃ©lÃ¨ne wanted to
 45722	be divorced from her husband (had such a report spread many would have
 45723	opposed so illegal an intention) but simply that the unfortunate and
 45724	interesting HÃ©lÃ¨ne was in doubt which of the two men she should marry.
 45725	The question was no longer whether this was possible, but only which was
 45726	the better match and how the matter would be regarded at court. There
 45727	were, it is true, some rigid individuals unable to rise to the height of
 45728	such a question, who saw in the project a desecration of the sacrament
 45729	of marriage, but there were not many such and they remained silent,
 45730	while the majority were interested in HÃ©lÃ¨neâs good fortune and in the
 45731	question which match would be the more advantageous. Whether it was
 45732	right or wrong to remarry while one had a husband living they did not
 45733	discuss, for that question had evidently been settled by people âwiser
 45734	than you or me,â as they said, and to doubt the correctness of that
 45735	decision would be to risk exposing oneâs stupidity and incapacity to
 45736	live in society.
 45737	
 45738	Only MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna AkhrosÃ­mova, who had come to Petersburg that
 45739	summer to see one of her sons, allowed herself plainly to express
 45740	an opinion contrary to the general one. Meeting HÃ©lÃ¨ne at a ball she
 45741	stopped her in the middle of the room and, amid general silence, said
 45742	in her gruff voice: âSo wives of living men have started marrying
 45743	again! Perhaps you think you have invented a novelty? You have been
 45744	forestalled, my dear! It was thought of long ago. It is done in all the
 45745	brothels,â and with these words MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna, turning up her wide
 45746	sleeves with her usual threatening gesture and glancing sternly round,
 45747	moved across the room.
 45748	
 45749	Though people were afraid of MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna she was regarded in
 45750	Petersburg as a buffoon, and so of what she had said they only noticed,
 45751	and repeated in a whisper, the one coarse word she had used, supposing
 45752	the whole sting of her remark to lie in that word.
 45753	
 45754	Prince VasÃ­li, who of late very often forgot what he had said and
 45755	repeated one and the same thing a hundred times, remarked to his
 45756	daughter whenever he chanced to see her:
 45757	
 45758	âHÃ©lÃ¨ne, I have a word to say to you,â and he would lead her
 45759	aside, drawing her hand downward. âI have heard of certain projects
 45760	concerning... you know. Well my dear child, you know how your fatherâs
 45761	heart rejoices to know that you... You have suffered so much.... But, my
 45762	dear child, consult only your own heart. That is all I have to say,â and
 45763	concealing his unvarying emotion he would press his cheek against his
 45764	daughterâs and move away.
 45765	
 45766	BilÃ­bin, who had not lost his reputation of an exceedingly clever man,
 45767	and who was one of the disinterested friends so brilliant a woman as
 45768	HÃ©lÃ¨ne always hasâmen friends who can never change into loversâonce gave
 45769	her his view of the matter at a small and intimate gathering.
 45770	
 45771	âListen, BilÃ­bin,â said HÃ©lÃ¨ne (she always called friends of that sort
 45772	by their surnames), and she touched his coat sleeve with her white,
 45773	beringed fingers. âTell me, as you would a sister, what I ought to do.
 45774	Which of the two?â
 45775	
 45776	BilÃ­bin wrinkled up the skin over his eyebrows and pondered, with a
 45777	smile on his lips.
 45778	
 45779	âYou are not taking me unawares, you know,â said he. âAs a true friend,
 45780	I have thought and thought again about your affair. You see, if you
 45781	marry the princeââhe meant the younger manâand he crooked one finger,
 45782	âyou forever lose the chance of marrying the other, and you will
 45783	displease the court besides. (You know there is some kind of
 45784	connection.) But if you marry the old count you will make his last days
 45785	happy, and as widow of the Grand... the prince would no longer be making
 45786	a mÃ©salliance by marrying you,â and BilÃ­bin smoothed out his forehead.
 45787	
 45788	âThatâs a true friend!â said HÃ©lÃ¨ne beaming, and again touching
 45789	BilÃ­binâs sleeve. âBut I love them, you know, and donât want to distress
 45790	either of them. I would give my life for the happiness of them both.â
 45791	
 45792	BilÃ­bin shrugged his shoulders, as much as to say that not even he could
 45793	help in that difficulty.
 45794	
 45795	âUne maÃ®tresse-femme! * Thatâs what is called putting things squarely.
 45796	She would like to be married to all three at the same time,â thought he.
 45797	
 45798	    * A masterly woman.
 45799	
 45800	âBut tell me, how will your husband look at the matter?â BilÃ­bin asked,
 45801	his reputation being so well established that he did not fear to ask so
 45802	naÃ¯ve a question. âWill he agree?â
 45803	
 45804	âOh, he loves me so!â said HÃ©lÃ¨ne, who for some reason imagined that
 45805	Pierre too loved her. âHe will do anything for me.â
 45806	
 45807	BilÃ­bin puckered his skin in preparation for something witty.
 45808	
 45809	âEven divorce you?â said he.
 45810	
 45811	HÃ©lÃ¨ne laughed.
 45812	
 45813	Among those who ventured to doubt the justifiability of the proposed
 45814	marriage was HÃ©lÃ¨neâs mother, Princess KurÃ¡gina. She was continually
 45815	tormented by jealousy of her daughter, and now that jealousy concerned
 45816	a subject near to her own heart, she could not reconcile herself to the
 45817	idea. She consulted a Russian priest as to the possibility of divorce
 45818	and remarriage during a husbandâs lifetime, and the priest told her that
 45819	it was impossible, and to her delight showed her a text in the Gospel
 45820	which (as it seemed to him) plainly forbids remarriage while the husband
 45821	is alive.
 45822	
 45823	Armed with these arguments, which appeared to her unanswerable, she
 45824	drove to her daughterâs early one morning so as to find her alone.
 45825	
 45826	Having listened to her motherâs objections, HÃ©lÃ¨ne smiled blandly and
 45827	ironically.
 45828	
 45829	âBut it says plainly: âWhosoever shall marry her that is divorced...ââ
 45830	said the old princess.
 45831	
 45832	âAh, Maman, ne dites pas de bÃªtises. Vous ne comprenez rien. Dans ma
 45833	position jâai des devoirs,â * said HÃ©lÃ¨ne changing from Russian, in
 45834	which language she always felt that her case did not sound quite clear,
 45835	into French which suited it better.
 45836	
 45837	     * âOh, Mamma, donât talk nonsense! You donât understand
 45838	     anything. In my position I have obligations.â
 45839	
 45840	
 45841	âBut, my dear....â
 45842	
 45843	âOh, Mamma, how is it you donât understand that the Holy Father, who has
 45844	the right to grant dispensations...â
 45845	
 45846	Just then the lady companion who lived with HÃ©lÃ¨ne came in to announce
 45847	that His Highness was in the ballroom and wished to see her.
 45848	
 45849	âNon, dites-lui que je ne veux pas le voir, que je suis furieuse contre
 45850	lui, parce quâil mâa manquÃ© parole.â *
 45851	
 45852	     * âNo, tell him I donât wish to see him, I am furious with
 45853	     him for not keeping his word to me.â
 45854	
 45855	
 45856	âComtesse, Ã  tout pÃ©chÃ© misÃ©ricorde,â * said a fair-haired young man
 45857	with a long face and nose, as he entered the room.
 45858	
 45859	    * âCountess, there is mercy for every sin.â
 45860	
 45861	
 45862	The old princess rose respectfully and curtsied. The young man who had
 45863	entered took no notice of her. The princess nodded to her daughter and
 45864	sidled out of the room.
 45865	
 45866	âYes, she is right,â thought the old princess, all her convictions
 45867	dissipated by the appearance of His Highness. âShe is right, but how
 45868	is it that we in our irrecoverable youth did not know it? Yet it is so
 45869	simple,â she thought as she got into her carriage.
 45870	
 45871	
 45872	By the beginning of August HÃ©lÃ¨neâs affairs were clearly defined and
 45873	she wrote a letter to her husbandâwho, as she imagined, loved her very
 45874	muchâinforming him of her intention to marry N.N. and of her having
 45875	embraced the one true faith, and asking him to carry out all the
 45876	formalities necessary for a divorce, which would be explained to him by
 45877	the bearer of the letter.
 45878	
 45879	And so I pray God to have you, my friend, in His holy and powerful
 45880	keepingâYour friend HÃ©lÃ¨ne.
 45881	
 45882	This letter was brought to Pierreâs house when he was on the field of
 45883	BorodinÃ³.
 45884	
 45885	
 45886	
 45887	
 45888	
 45889	CHAPTER VIII
 45890	
 45891	Toward the end of the battle of BorodinÃ³, Pierre, having run down
 45892	from RaÃ©vskiâs battery a second time, made his way through a gully to
 45893	KnyazkÃ³vo with a crowd of soldiers, reached the dressing station, and
 45894	seeing blood and hearing cries and groans hurried on, still entangled in
 45895	the crowds of soldiers.
 45896	
 45897	The one thing he now desired with his whole soul was to get away quickly
 45898	from the terrible sensations amid which he had lived that day and return
 45899	to ordinary conditions of life and sleep quietly in a room in his own
 45900	bed. He felt that only in the ordinary conditions of life would he
 45901	be able to understand himself and all he had seen and felt. But such
 45902	ordinary conditions of life were nowhere to be found.
 45903	
 45904	Though shells and bullets did not whistle over the road along which he
 45905	was going, still on all sides there was what there had been on the field
 45906	of battle. There were still the same suffering, exhausted, and sometimes
 45907	strangely indifferent faces, the same blood, the same soldiersâ
 45908	overcoats, the same sounds of firing which, though distant now, still
 45909	aroused terror, and besides this there were the foul air and the dust.
 45910	
 45911	Having gone a couple of miles along the MozhÃ¡ysk road, Pierre sat down
 45912	by the roadside.
 45913	
 45914	Dusk had fallen, and the roar of guns died away. Pierre lay leaning on
 45915	his elbow for a long time, gazing at the shadows that moved past him in
 45916	the darkness. He was continually imagining that a cannon ball was flying
 45917	toward him with a terrific whizz, and then he shuddered and sat up. He
 45918	had no idea how long he had been there. In the middle of the night three
 45919	soldiers, having brought some firewood, settled down near him and began
 45920	lighting a fire.
 45921	
 45922	The soldiers, who threw sidelong glances at Pierre, got the fire to burn
 45923	and placed an iron pot on it into which they broke some dried bread and
 45924	put a little dripping. The pleasant odor of greasy viands mingled with
 45925	the smell of smoke. Pierre sat up and sighed. The three soldiers were
 45926	eating and talking among themselves, taking no notice of him.
 45927	
 45928	âAnd who may you be?â one of them suddenly asked Pierre, evidently
 45929	meaning what Pierre himself had in mind, namely: âIf you want to eat
 45930	weâll give you some food, only let us know whether you are an honest
 45931	man.â
 45932	
 45933	âI, I...â said Pierre, feeling it necessary to minimize his social
 45934	position as much as possible so as to be nearer to the soldiers and
 45935	better understood by them. âBy rights I am a militia officer, but my men
 45936	are not here. I came to the battle and have lost them.â
 45937	
 45938	âThere now!â said one of the soldiers.
 45939	
 45940	Another shook his head.
 45941	
 45942	âWould you like a little mash?â the first soldier asked, and handed
 45943	Pierre a wooden spoon after licking it clean.
 45944	
 45945	Pierre sat down by the fire and began eating the mash, as they called
 45946	the food in the cauldron, and he thought it more delicious than any food
 45947	he had ever tasted. As he sat bending greedily over it, helping himself
 45948	to large spoonfuls and chewing one after another, his face was lit up by
 45949	the fire and the soldiers looked at him in silence.
 45950	
 45951	âWhere have you to go to? Tell us!â said one of them.
 45952	
 45953	âTo MozhÃ¡ysk.â
 45954	
 45955	âYouâre a gentleman, arenât you?â
 45956	
 45957	âYes.â
 45958	
 45959	âAnd whatâs your name?â
 45960	
 45961	âPeter KirÃ­lych.â
 45962	
 45963	âWell then, Peter KirÃ­lych, come along with us, weâll take you there.â
 45964	
 45965	In the total darkness the soldiers walked with Pierre to MozhÃ¡ysk.
 45966	
 45967	By the time they got near MozhÃ¡ysk and began ascending the steep hill
 45968	into the town, the cocks were already crowing. Pierre went on with the
 45969	soldiers, quite forgetting that his inn was at the bottom of the hill
 45970	and that he had already passed it. He would not soon have remembered
 45971	this, such was his state of forgetfulness, had he not halfway up the
 45972	hill stumbled upon his groom, who had been to look for him in the
 45973	town and was returning to the inn. The groom recognized Pierre in the
 45974	darkness by his white hat.
 45975	
 45976	âYour excellency!â he said. âWhy, we were beginning to despair! How is
 45977	it you are on foot? And where are you going, please?â
 45978	
 45979	âOh, yes!â said Pierre.
 45980	
 45981	The soldiers stopped.
 45982	
 45983	âSo youâve found your folk?â said one of them. âWell, good-by, Peter
 45984	KirÃ­lychâisnât it?â
 45985	
 45986	âGood-by, Peter KirÃ­lych!â Pierre heard the other voices repeat.
 45987	
 45988	âGood-by!â he said and turned with his groom toward the inn.
 45989	
 45990	âI ought to give them something!â he thought, and felt in his pocket.
 45991	âNo, better not!â said another, inner voice.
 45992	
 45993	There was not a room to be had at the inn, they were all occupied.
 45994	Pierre went out into the yard and, covering himself up head and all, lay
 45995	down in his carriage.
 45996	
 45997	
 45998	
 45999	
 46000	
 46001	CHAPTER IX
 46002	
 46003	Scarcely had Pierre laid his head on the pillow before he felt himself
 46004	falling asleep, but suddenly, almost with the distinctness of reality,
 46005	he heard the boom, boom, boom of firing, the thud of projectiles, groans
 46006	and cries, and smelled blood and powder, and a feeling of horror and
 46007	dread of death seized him. Filled with fright he opened his eyes and
 46008	lifted his head from under his cloak. All was tranquil in the yard. Only
 46009	someoneâs orderly passed through the gateway, splashing through the mud,
 46010	and talked to the innkeeper. Above Pierreâs head some pigeons, disturbed
 46011	by the movement he had made in sitting up, fluttered under the dark roof
 46012	of the penthouse. The whole courtyard was permeated by a strong peaceful
 46013	smell of stable yards, delightful to Pierre at that moment. He could see
 46014	the clear starry sky between the dark roofs of two penthouses.
 46015	
 46016	âThank God, there is no more of that!â he thought, covering up his head
 46017	again. âOh, what a terrible thing is fear, and how shamefully I yielded
 46018	to it! But they... they were steady and calm all the time, to the
 46019	end...â thought he.
 46020	
 46021	They, in Pierreâs mind, were the soldiers, those who had been at the
 46022	battery, those who had given him food, and those who had prayed before
 46023	the icon. They, those strange men he had not previously known, stood out
 46024	clearly and sharply from everyone else.
 46025	
 46026	âTo be a soldier, just a soldier!â thought Pierre as he fell asleep,
 46027	âto enter communal life completely, to be imbued by what makes them what
 46028	they are. But how cast off all the superfluous, devilish burden of my
 46029	outer man? There was a time when I could have done it. I could have run
 46030	away from my father, as I wanted to. Or I might have been sent to serve
 46031	as a soldier after the duel with DÃ³lokhov.â And the memory of the dinner
 46032	at the English Club when he had challenged DÃ³lokhov flashed through
 46033	Pierreâs mind, and then he remembered his benefactor at TorzhÃ³k. And now
 46034	a picture of a solemn meeting of the lodge presented itself to his mind.
 46035	It was taking place at the English Club and someone near and dear to him
 46036	sat at the end of the table. âYes, that is he! It is my benefactor.
 46037	But he died!â thought Pierre. âYes, he died, and I did not know he was
 46038	alive. How sorry I am that he died, and how glad I am that he is alive
 46039	again!â On one side of the table sat Anatole, DÃ³lokhov, NesvÃ­tski,
 46040	DenÃ­sov, and others like them (in his dream the category to which these
 46041	men belonged was as clearly defined in his mind as the category of
 46042	those he termed they), and he heard those people, Anatole and DÃ³lokhov,
 46043	shouting and singing loudly; yet through their shouting the voice of his
 46044	benefactor was heard speaking all the time and the sound of his words
 46045	was as weighty and uninterrupted as the booming on the battlefield, but
 46046	pleasant and comforting. Pierre did not understand what his benefactor
 46047	was saying, but he knew (the categories of thoughts were also quite
 46048	distinct in his dream) that he was talking of goodness and the
 46049	possibility of being what they were. And they with their simple, kind,
 46050	firm faces surrounded his benefactor on all sides. But though they were
 46051	kindly they did not look at Pierre and did not know him. Wishing to
 46052	speak and to attract their attention, he got up, but at that moment his
 46053	legs grew cold and bare.
 46054	
 46055	He felt ashamed, and with one arm covered his legs from which his cloak
 46056	had in fact slipped. For a moment as he was rearranging his cloak Pierre
 46057	opened his eyes and saw the same penthouse roofs, posts, and yard, but
 46058	now they were all bluish, lit up, and glittering with frost or dew.
 46059	
 46060	âIt is dawn,â thought Pierre. âBut thatâs not what I want. I want to
 46061	hear and understand my benefactorâs words.â Again he covered himself up
 46062	with his cloak, but now neither the lodge nor his benefactor was there.
 46063	There were only thoughts clearly expressed in words, thoughts that
 46064	someone was uttering or that he himself was formulating.
 46065	
 46066	Afterwards when he recalled those thoughts Pierre was convinced that
 46067	someone outside himself had spoken them, though the impressions of that
 46068	day had evoked them. He had never, it seemed to him, been able to think
 46069	and express his thoughts like that when awake.
 46070	
 46071	âTo endure war is the most difficult subordination of manâs freedom to
 46072	the law of God,â the voice had said. âSimplicity is submission to the
 46073	will of God; you cannot escape from Him. And they are simple. They do
 46074	not talk, but act. The spoken word is silver but the unspoken is golden.
 46075	Man can be master of nothing while he fears death, but he who does not
 46076	fear it possesses all. If there were no suffering, man would not know
 46077	his limitations, would not know himself. The hardest thing (Pierre went
 46078	on thinking, or hearing, in his dream) is to be able in your soul to
 46079	unite the meaning of all. To unite all?â he asked himself. âNo, not
 46080	to unite. Thoughts cannot be united, but to harness all these thoughts
 46081	together is what we need! Yes, one must harness them, must harness
 46082	them!â he repeated to himself with inward rapture, feeling that these
 46083	words and they alone expressed what he wanted to say and solved the
 46084	question that tormented him.
 46085	
 46086	âYes, one must harness, it is time to harness.â
 46087	
 46088	âTime to harness, time to harness, your excellency! Your excellency!â
 46089	some voice was repeating. âWe must harness, it is time to harness....â
 46090	
 46091	It was the voice of the groom, trying to wake him. The sun shone
 46092	straight into Pierreâs face. He glanced at the dirty innyard in the
 46093	middle of which soldiers were watering their lean horses at the pump
 46094	while carts were passing out of the gate. Pierre turned away with
 46095	repugnance, and closing his eyes quickly fell back on the carriage seat.
 46096	âNo, I donât want that, I donât want to see and understand that. I want
 46097	to understand what was revealing itself to me in my dream. One second
 46098	more and I should have understood it all! But what am I to do? Harness,
 46099	but how can I harness everything?â and Pierre felt with horror that the
 46100	meaning of all he had seen and thought in the dream had been destroyed.
 46101	
 46102	The groom, the coachman, and the innkeeper told Pierre that an officer
 46103	had come with news that the French were already near MozhÃ¡ysk and that
 46104	our men were leaving it.
 46105	
 46106	Pierre got up and, having told them to harness and overtake him, went on
 46107	foot through the town.
 46108	
 46109	The troops were moving on, leaving about ten thousand wounded behind
 46110	them. There were wounded in the yards, at the windows of the houses, and
 46111	the streets were crowded with them. In the streets, around carts that
 46112	were to take some of the wounded away, shouts, curses, and blows could
 46113	be heard. Pierre offered the use of his carriage, which had overtaken
 46114	him, to a wounded general he knew, and drove with him to Moscow. On the
 46115	way Pierre was told of the death of his brother-in-law Anatole and of
 46116	that of Prince Andrew.
 46117	
 46118	
 46119	
 46120	
 46121	
 46122	CHAPTER X
 46123	
 46124	On the thirtieth of August Pierre reached Moscow. Close to the gates of
 46125	the city he was met by Count RostopchÃ­nâs adjutant.
 46126	
 46127	âWe have been looking for you everywhere,â said the adjutant. âThe count
 46128	wants to see you particularly. He asks you to come to him at once on a
 46129	very important matter.â
 46130	
 46131	Without going home, Pierre took a cab and drove to see the Moscow
 46132	commander in chief.
 46133	
 46134	Count RostopchÃ­n had only that morning returned to town from his summer
 46135	villa at SokÃ³lniki. The anteroom and reception room of his house
 46136	were full of officials who had been summoned or had come for orders.
 46137	VasÃ­lchikov and PlÃ¡tov had already seen the count and explained to him
 46138	that it was impossible to defend Moscow and that it would have to be
 46139	surrendered. Though this news was being concealed from the inhabitants,
 46140	the officialsâthe heads of the various government departmentsâknew that
 46141	Moscow would soon be in the enemyâs hands, just as Count RostopchÃ­n
 46142	himself knew it, and to escape personal responsibility they had all
 46143	come to the governor to ask how they were to deal with their various
 46144	departments.
 46145	
 46146	As Pierre was entering the reception room a courier from the army came
 46147	out of RostopchÃ­nâs private room.
 46148	
 46149	In answer to questions with which he was greeted, the courier made a
 46150	despairing gesture with his hand and passed through the room.
 46151	
 46152	While waiting in the reception room Pierre with weary eyes watched the
 46153	various officials, old and young, military and civilian, who were there.
 46154	They all seemed dissatisfied and uneasy. Pierre went up to a group of
 46155	men, one of whom he knew. After greeting Pierre they continued their
 46156	conversation.
 46157	
 46158	âIf theyâre sent out and brought back again later on it will do no harm,
 46159	but as things are now one canât answer for anything.â
 46160	
 46161	âBut you see what he writes...â said another, pointing to a printed
 46162	sheet he held in his hand.
 46163	
 46164	âThatâs another matter. Thatâs necessary for the people,â said the
 46165	first.
 46166	
 46167	âWhat is it?â asked Pierre.
 46168	
 46169	âOh, itâs a fresh broadsheet.â
 46170	
 46171	Pierre took it and began reading.
 46172	
 46173	His Serene Highness has passed through MozhÃ¡ysk in order to join up with
 46174	the troops moving toward him and has taken up a strong position where
 46175	the enemy will not soon attack him. Forty-eight guns with ammunition
 46176	have been sent him from here, and his Serene Highness says he will
 46177	defend Moscow to the last drop of blood and is even ready to fight in
 46178	the streets. Do not be upset, brothers, that the law courts are closed;
 46179	things have to be put in order, and we will deal with villains in our
 46180	own way! When the time comes I shall want both town and peasant lads and
 46181	will raise the cry a day or two beforehand, but they are not wanted yet
 46182	so I hold my peace. An ax will be useful, a hunting spear not bad, but a
 46183	three-pronged fork will be best of all: a Frenchman is no heavier than a
 46184	sheaf of rye. Tomorrow after dinner I shall take the Iberian icon of
 46185	the Mother of God to the wounded in the Catherine Hospital where we will
 46186	have some water blessed. That will help them to get well quicker. I,
 46187	too, am well now: one of my eyes was sore but now I am on the lookout
 46188	with both.
 46189	
 46190	âBut military men have told me that it is impossible to fight in the
 46191	town,â said Pierre, âand that the position...â
 46192	
 46193	âWell, of course! Thatâs what we were saying,â replied the first
 46194	speaker.
 46195	
 46196	âAnd what does he mean by âOne of my eyes was sore but now I am on the
 46197	lookout with bothâ?â asked Pierre.
 46198	
 46199	âThe count had a sty,â replied the adjutant smiling, âand was very much
 46200	upset when I told him people had come to ask what was the matter with
 46201	him. By the by, Count,â he added suddenly, addressing Pierre with a
 46202	smile, âwe heard that you have family troubles and that the countess,
 46203	your wife...â
 46204	
 46205	âI have heard nothing,â Pierre replied unconcernedly. âBut what have you
 46206	heard?â
 46207	
 46208	âOh, well, you know people often invent things. I only say what I
 46209	heard.â
 46210	
 46211	âBut what did you hear?â
 46212	
 46213	âWell, they say,â continued the adjutant with the same smile, âthat
 46214	the countess, your wife, is preparing to go abroad. I expect itâs
 46215	nonsense....â
 46216	
 46217	âPossibly,â remarked Pierre, looking about him absent-mindedly. âAnd who
 46218	is that?â he asked, indicating a short old man in a clean blue peasant
 46219	overcoat, with a big snow-white beard and eyebrows and a ruddy face.
 46220	
 46221	âHe? Thatâs a tradesman, that is to say, heâs the restaurant
 46222	keeper, VereshchÃ¡gin. Perhaps you have heard of that affair with the
 46223	proclamation.â
 46224	
 46225	âOh, so that is VereshchÃ¡gin!â said Pierre, looking at the firm, calm
 46226	face of the old man and seeking any indication of his being a traitor.
 46227	
 46228	âThatâs not he himself, thatâs the father of the fellow who wrote the
 46229	proclamation,â said the adjutant. âThe young man is in prison and I
 46230	expect it will go hard with him.â
 46231	
 46232	An old gentleman wearing a star and another official, a German wearing a
 46233	cross round his neck, approached the speaker.
 46234	
 46235	âItâs a complicated story, you know,â said the adjutant. âThat
 46236	proclamation appeared about two months ago. The count was informed of
 46237	it. He gave orders to investigate the matter. Gabriel IvÃ¡novich
 46238	here made the inquiries. The proclamation had passed through exactly
 46239	sixty-three hands. He asked one, âFrom whom did you get it?â âFrom
 46240	so-and-so.â He went to the next one. âFrom whom did you get it?â and so
 46241	on till he reached VereshchÃ¡gin, a half educated tradesman, you know, âa
 46242	pet of a trader,ââ said the adjutant smiling. âThey asked him, âWho gave
 46243	it you?â And the point is that we knew whom he had it from. He could
 46244	only have had it from the Postmaster. But evidently they had come to
 46245	some understanding. He replied: âFrom no one; I made it up myself.â
 46246	They threatened and questioned him, but he stuck to that: âI made it
 46247	up myself.â And so it was reported to the count, who sent for the man.
 46248	âFrom whom did you get the proclamation?â âI wrote it myself.â Well, you
 46249	know the count,â said the adjutant cheerfully, with a smile of pride,
 46250	âhe flared up dreadfullyâand just think of the fellowâs audacity, lying,
 46251	and obstinacy!â
 46252	
 46253	âAnd the count wanted him to say it was from KlyucharÃ«v? I understand!â
 46254	said Pierre.
 46255	
 46256	âNot at all,â rejoined the adjutant in dismay. âKlyucharÃ«v had his own
 46257	sins to answer for without that and that is why he has been banished.
 46258	But the point is that the count was much annoyed. âHow could you have
 46259	written it yourself?â said he, and he took up the Hamburg Gazette that
 46260	was lying on the table. âHere it is! You did not write it yourself but
 46261	translated it, and translated it abominably, because you donât even know
 46262	French, you fool.â And what do you think? âNo,â said he, âI have not
 46263	read any papers, I made it up myself.â âIf thatâs so, youâre a traitor
 46264	and Iâll have you tried, and youâll be hanged! Say from whom you had
 46265	it.â âI have seen no papers, I made it up myself.â And that was the end
 46266	of it. The count had the father fetched, but the fellow stuck to it.
 46267	He was sent for trial and condemned to hard labor, I believe. Now the
 46268	father has come to intercede for him. But heâs a good-for-nothing lad!
 46269	You know that sort of tradesmanâs son, a dandy and lady-killer. He
 46270	attended some lectures somewhere and imagines that the devil is no match
 46271	for him. Thatâs the sort of fellow he is. His father keeps a cookshop
 46272	here by the Stone Bridge, and you know there was a large icon of God
 46273	Almighty painted with a scepter in one hand and an orb in the other.
 46274	Well, he took that icon home with him for a few days and what did he do?
 46275	He found some scoundrel of a painter...â
 46276	
 46277	
 46278	
 46279	
 46280	
 46281	CHAPTER XI
 46282	
 46283	In the middle of this fresh tale Pierre was summoned to the commander in
 46284	chief.
 46285	
 46286	When he entered the private room Count RostopchÃ­n, puckering his face,
 46287	was rubbing his forehead and eyes with his hand. A short man was saying
 46288	something, but when Pierre entered he stopped speaking and went out.
 46289	
 46290	âAh, how do you do, great warrior?â said RostopchÃ­n as soon as the short
 46291	man had left the room. âWe have heard of your prowess. But thatâs not
 46292	the point. Between ourselves, mon cher, do you belong to the Masons?â he
 46293	went on severely, as though there were something wrong about it which
 46294	he nevertheless intended to pardon. Pierre remained silent. âI am well
 46295	informed, my friend, but I am aware that there are Masons and I hope
 46296	that you are not one of those who on pretense of saving mankind wish to
 46297	ruin Russia.â
 46298	
 46299	âYes, I am a Mason,â Pierre replied.
 46300	
 46301	âThere, you see, mon cher! I expect you know that Messrs. SperÃ¡nski and
 46302	MagnÃ­tski have been deported to their proper place. Mr. KlyucharÃ«v has
 46303	been treated in the same way, and so have others who on the plea of
 46304	building up the temple of Solomon have tried to destroy the temple of
 46305	their fatherland. You can understand that there are reasons for this and
 46306	that I could not have exiled the Postmaster had he not been a harmful
 46307	person. It has now come to my knowledge that you lent him your carriage
 46308	for his removal from town, and that you have even accepted papers from
 46309	him for safe custody. I like you and donât wish you any harm andâas
 46310	you are only half my ageâI advise you, as a father would, to cease
 46311	all communication with men of that stamp and to leave here as soon as
 46312	possible.â
 46313	
 46314	âBut what did KlyucharÃ«v do wrong, Count?â asked Pierre.
 46315	
 46316	âThat is for me to know, but not for you to ask,â shouted RostopchÃ­n.
 46317	
 46318	âIf he is accused of circulating Napoleonâs proclamation it is not
 46319	proved that he did so,â said Pierre without looking at RostopchÃ­n, âand
 46320	VereshchÃ¡gin...â
 46321	
 46322	âThere we are!â RostopchÃ­n shouted at Pierre louder than before,
 46323	frowning suddenly. âVereshchÃ¡gin is a renegade and a traitor who will
 46324	be punished as he deserves,â said he with the vindictive heat with which
 46325	people speak when recalling an insult. âBut I did not summon you to
 46326	discuss my actions, but to give you adviceâor an order if you prefer it.
 46327	I beg you to leave the town and break off all communication with such
 46328	men as KlyucharÃ«v. And I will knock the nonsense out of anybodyââbut
 46329	probably realizing that he was shouting at BezÃºkhov who so far was not
 46330	guilty of anything, he added, taking Pierreâs hand in a friendly manner,
 46331	âWe are on the eve of a public disaster and I havenât time to be polite
 46332	to everybody who has business with me. My head is sometimes in a whirl.
 46333	Well, mon cher, what are you doing personally?â
 46334	
 46335	âWhy, nothing,â answered Pierre without raising his eyes or changing the
 46336	thoughtful expression of his face.
 46337	
 46338	The count frowned.
 46339	
 46340	âA word of friendly advice, mon cher. Be off as soon as you can, thatâs
 46341	all I have to tell you. Happy he who has ears to hear. Good-by, my dear
 46342	fellow. Oh, by the by!â he shouted through the doorway after Pierre,
 46343	âis it true that the countess has fallen into the clutches of the holy
 46344	fathers of the Society of Jesus?â
 46345	
 46346	Pierre did not answer and left RostopchÃ­nâs room more sullen and angry
 46347	than he had ever before shown himself.
 46348	
 46349	When he reached home it was already getting dark. Some eight people had
 46350	come to see him that evening: the secretary of a committee, the colonel
 46351	of his battalion, his steward, his major-domo, and various petitioners.
 46352	They all had business with Pierre and wanted decisions from him. Pierre
 46353	did not understand and was not interested in any of these questions and
 46354	only answered them in order to get rid of these people. When left alone
 46355	at last he opened and read his wifeâs letter.
 46356	
 46357	âThey, the soldiers at the battery, Prince Andrew killed... that old
 46358	man... Simplicity is submission to God. Suffering is necessary... the
 46359	meaning of all... one must harness... my wife is getting married... One
 46360	must forget and understand...â And going to his bed he threw himself on
 46361	it without undressing and immediately fell asleep.
 46362	
 46363	When he awoke next morning the major-domo came to inform him that a
 46364	special messenger, a police officer, had come from Count RostopchÃ­n to
 46365	know whether Count BezÃºkhov had left or was leaving the town.
 46366	
 46367	A dozen persons who had business with Pierre were awaiting him in the
 46368	drawing room. Pierre dressed hurriedly and, instead of going to see
 46369	them, went to the back porch and out through the gate.
 46370	
 46371	From that time till the end of the destruction of Moscow no one of
 46372	BezÃºkhovâs household, despite all the search they made, saw Pierre again
 46373	or knew where he was.
 46374	
 46375	
 46376	
 46377	
 46378	
 46379	CHAPTER XII
 46380	
 46381	The RostÃ³vs remained in Moscow till the first of September, that is,
 46382	till the eve of the enemyâs entry into the city.
 46383	
 46384	After PÃ©tya had joined ObolÃ©nskiâs regiment of Cossacks and left for
 46385	BÃ©laya TsÃ©rkov where that regiment was forming, the countess was seized
 46386	with terror. The thought that both her sons were at the war, had both
 46387	gone from under her wing, that today or tomorrow either or both of them
 46388	might be killed like the three sons of one of her acquaintances, struck
 46389	her that summer for the first time with cruel clearness. She tried to
 46390	get Nicholas back and wished to go herself to join PÃ©tya, or to get
 46391	him an appointment somewhere in Petersburg, but neither of these proved
 46392	possible. PÃ©tya could not return unless his regiment did so or unless
 46393	he was transferred to another regiment on active service. Nicholas was
 46394	somewhere with the army and had not sent a word since his last letter,
 46395	in which he had given a detailed account of his meeting with Princess
 46396	Mary. The countess did not sleep at night, or when she did fall asleep
 46397	dreamed that she saw her sons lying dead. After many consultations and
 46398	conversations, the count at last devised means to tranquillize her. He
 46399	got PÃ©tya transferred from ObolÃ©nskiâs regiment to BezÃºkhovâs, which was
 46400	in training near Moscow. Though PÃ©tya would remain in the service, this
 46401	transfer would give the countess the consolation of seeing at least one
 46402	of her sons under her wing, and she hoped to arrange matters for her
 46403	PÃ©tya so as not to let him go again, but always get him appointed to
 46404	places where he could not possibly take part in a battle. As long as
 46405	Nicholas alone was in danger the countess imagined that she loved her
 46406	first-born more than all her other children and even reproached herself
 46407	for it; but when her youngest: the scapegrace who had been bad at
 46408	lessons, was always breaking things in the house and making himself a
 46409	nuisance to everybody, that snub-nosed PÃ©tya with his merry black eyes
 46410	and fresh rosy cheeks where soft down was just beginning to showâwhen
 46411	he was thrown amid those big, dreadful, cruel men who were fighting
 46412	somewhere about something and apparently finding pleasure in itâthen
 46413	his mother thought she loved him more, much more, than all her other
 46414	children. The nearer the time came for PÃ©tya to return, the more uneasy
 46415	grew the countess. She began to think she would never live to see such
 46416	happiness. The presence of SÃ³nya, of her beloved NatÃ¡sha, or even of
 46417	her husband irritated her. âWhat do I want with them? I want no one but
 46418	PÃ©tya,â she thought.
 46419	
 46420	At the end of August the RostÃ³vs received another letter from Nicholas.
 46421	He wrote from the province of VorÃ³nezh where he had been sent to procure
 46422	remounts, but that letter did not set the countess at ease. Knowing that
 46423	one son was out of danger she became the more anxious about PÃ©tya.
 46424	
 46425	Though by the twentieth of August nearly all the RostÃ³vsâ acquaintances
 46426	had left Moscow, and though everybody tried to persuade the countess to
 46427	get away as quickly as possible, she would not hear of leaving before
 46428	her treasure, her adored PÃ©tya, returned. On the twenty-eighth of August
 46429	he arrived. The passionate tenderness with which his mother received him
 46430	did not please the sixteen-year-old officer. Though she concealed from
 46431	him her intention of keeping him under her wing, PÃ©tya guessed her
 46432	designs, and instinctively fearing that he might give way to emotion
 46433	when with herâmight âbecome womanishâ as he termed it to himselfâhe
 46434	treated her coldly, avoided her, and during his stay in Moscow attached
 46435	himself exclusively to NatÃ¡sha for whom he had always had a particularly
 46436	brotherly tenderness, almost lover-like.
 46437	
 46438	Owing to the countâs customary carelessness nothing was ready for their
 46439	departure by the twenty-eighth of August and the carts that were to
 46440	come from their RyazÃ¡n and Moscow estates to remove their household
 46441	belongings did not arrive till the thirtieth.
 46442	
 46443	From the twenty-eighth till the thirty-first all Moscow was in a bustle
 46444	and commotion. Every day thousands of men wounded at BorodinÃ³ were
 46445	brought in by the DorogomÃ­lov gate and taken to various parts of Moscow,
 46446	and thousands of carts conveyed the inhabitants and their possessions
 46447	out by the other gates. In spite of RostopchÃ­nâs broadsheets, or because
 46448	of them or independently of them, the strangest and most contradictory
 46449	rumors were current in the town. Some said that no one was to be allowed
 46450	to leave the city, others on the contrary said that all the icons had
 46451	been taken out of the churches and everybody was to be ordered to leave.
 46452	Some said there had been another battle after BorodinÃ³ at which the
 46453	French had been routed, while others on the contrary reported that the
 46454	Russian army had been destroyed. Some talked about the Moscow militia
 46455	which, preceded by the clergy, would go to the Three Hills; others
 46456	whispered that Augustin had been forbidden to leave, that traitors had
 46457	been seized, that the peasants were rioting and robbing people on their
 46458	way from Moscow, and so on. But all this was only talk; in reality
 46459	(though the Council of FilÃ­, at which it was decided to abandon Moscow,
 46460	had not yet been held) both those who went away and those who remained
 46461	behind felt, though they did not show it, that Moscow would certainly
 46462	be abandoned, and that they ought to get away as quickly as possible and
 46463	save their belongings. It was felt that everything would suddenly break
 46464	up and change, but up to the first of September nothing had done so.
 46465	As a criminal who is being led to execution knows that he must die
 46466	immediately, but yet looks about him and straightens the cap that is
 46467	awry on his head, so Moscow involuntarily continued its wonted life,
 46468	though it knew that the time of its destruction was near when the
 46469	conditions of life to which its people were accustomed to submit would
 46470	be completely upset.
 46471	
 46472	During the three days preceding the occupation of Moscow the whole
 46473	RostÃ³v family was absorbed in various activities. The head of the
 46474	family, Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v, continually drove about the city collecting
 46475	the current rumors from all sides and gave superficial and hasty orders
 46476	at home about the preparations for their departure.
 46477	
 46478	The countess watched the things being packed, was dissatisfied with
 46479	everything, was constantly in pursuit of PÃ©tya who was always running
 46480	away from her, and was jealous of NatÃ¡sha with whom he spent all his
 46481	time. SÃ³nya alone directed the practical side of matters by getting
 46482	things packed. But of late SÃ³nya had been particularly sad and silent.
 46483	Nicholasâ letter in which he mentioned Princess Mary had elicited, in
 46484	her presence, joyous comments from the countess, who saw an intervention
 46485	of Providence in this meeting of the princess and Nicholas.
 46486	
 46487	âI was never pleased at BolkÃ³nskiâs engagement to NatÃ¡sha,â said the
 46488	countess, âbut I always wanted Nicholas to marry the princess, and had a
 46489	presentiment that it would happen. What a good thing it would be!â
 46490	
 46491	SÃ³nya felt that this was true: that the only possibility of retrieving
 46492	the RostÃ³vsâ affairs was by Nicholas marrying a rich woman, and that the
 46493	princess was a good match. It was very bitter for her. But despite
 46494	her grief, or perhaps just because of it, she took on herself all the
 46495	difficult work of directing the storing and packing of their things and
 46496	was busy for whole days. The count and countess turned to her when they
 46497	had any orders to give. PÃ©tya and NatÃ¡sha on the contrary, far from
 46498	helping their parents, were generally a nuisance and a hindrance to
 46499	everyone. Almost all day long the house resounded with their running
 46500	feet, their cries, and their spontaneous laughter. They laughed and were
 46501	gay not because there was any reason to laugh, but because gaiety and
 46502	mirth were in their hearts and so everything that happened was a cause
 46503	for gaiety and laughter to them. PÃ©tya was in high spirits because
 46504	having left home a boy he had returned (as everybody told him) a fine
 46505	young man, because he was at home, because he had left BÃ©laya TsÃ©rkov
 46506	where there was no hope of soon taking part in a battle and had come to
 46507	Moscow where there was to be fighting in a few days, and chiefly because
 46508	NatÃ¡sha, whose lead he always followed, was in high spirits. NatÃ¡sha was
 46509	gay because she had been sad too long and now nothing reminded her of
 46510	the cause of her sadness, and because she was feeling well. She was also
 46511	happy because she had someone to adore her: the adoration of others was
 46512	a lubricant the wheels of her machine needed to make them run freelyâand
 46513	PÃ©tya adored her. Above all, they were gay because there was a war near
 46514	Moscow, there would be fighting at the town gates, arms were being
 46515	given out, everybody was escapingâgoing away somewhere, and in general
 46516	something extraordinary was happening, and that is always exciting,
 46517	especially to the young.

 46523	CHAPTER XIII
 46524	
 46525	On Saturday, the thirty-first of August, everything in the RostÃ³vsâ
 46526	house seemed topsy-turvy. All the doors were open, all the furniture was
 46527	being carried out or moved about, and the mirrors and pictures had been
 46528	taken down. There were trunks in the rooms, and hay, wrapping paper, and
 46529	ropes were scattered about. The peasants and house serfs carrying out
 46530	the things were treading heavily on the parquet floors. The yard was
 46531	crowded with peasant carts, some loaded high and already corded up,
 46532	others still empty.
 46533	
 46534	The voices and footsteps of the many servants and of the peasants who
 46535	had come with the carts resounded as they shouted to one another in
 46536	the yard and in the house. The count had been out since morning. The
 46537	countess had a headache brought on by all the noise and turmoil and was
 46538	lying down in the new sitting room with a vinegar compress on her head.
 46539	PÃ©tya was not at home, he had gone to visit a friend with whom he meant
 46540	to obtain a transfer from the militia to the active army. SÃ³nya was in
 46541	the ballroom looking after the packing of the glass and china. NatÃ¡sha
 46542	was sitting on the floor of her dismantled room with dresses, ribbons,
 46543	and scarves strewn all about her, gazing fixedly at the floor and
 46544	holding in her hands the old ball dress (already out of fashion) which
 46545	she had worn at her first Petersburg ball.
 46546	
 46547	NatÃ¡sha was ashamed of doing nothing when everyone else was so busy, and
 46548	several times that morning had tried to set to work, but her heart was
 46549	not in it, and she could not and did not know how to do anything except
 46550	with all her heart and all her might. For a while she had stood beside
 46551	SÃ³nya while the china was being packed and tried to help, but soon gave
 46552	it up and went to her room to pack her own things. At first she found it
 46553	amusing to give away dresses and ribbons to the maids, but when that was
 46554	done and what was left had still to be packed, she found it dull.
 46555	
 46556	âDunyÃ¡sha, you pack! You will, wonât you, dear?â And when DunyÃ¡sha
 46557	willingly promised to do it all for her, NatÃ¡sha sat down on the floor,
 46558	took her old ball dress, and fell into a reverie quite unrelated to what
 46559	ought to have occupied her thoughts now. She was roused from her reverie
 46560	by the talk of the maids in the next room (which was theirs) and by the
 46561	sound of their hurried footsteps going to the back porch. NatÃ¡sha got
 46562	up and looked out of the window. An enormously long row of carts full of
 46563	wounded men had stopped in the street.
 46564	
 46565	The housekeeper, the old nurse, the cooks, coachmen, maids, footmen,
 46566	postilions, and scullions stood at the gate, staring at the wounded.
 46567	
 46568	NatÃ¡sha, throwing a clean pocket handkerchief over her hair and holding
 46569	an end of it in each hand, went out into the street.
 46570	
 46571	The former housekeeper, old MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna, had stepped out of the
 46572	crowd by the gate, gone up to a cart with a hood constructed of bast
 46573	mats, and was speaking to a pale young officer who lay inside.
 46574	NatÃ¡sha moved a few steps forward and stopped shyly, still holding her
 46575	handkerchief, and listened to what the housekeeper was saying.
 46576	
 46577	âThen you have nobody in Moscow?â she was saying. âYou would be more
 46578	comfortable somewhere in a house... in ours, for instance... the family
 46579	are leaving.â
 46580	
 46581	âI donât know if it would be allowed,â replied the officer in a weak
 46582	voice. âHere is our commanding officer... ask him,â and he pointed to a
 46583	stout major who was walking back along the street past the row of carts.
 46584	
 46585	NatÃ¡sha glanced with frightened eyes at the face of the wounded officer
 46586	and at once went to meet the major.
 46587	
 46588	âMay the wounded men stay in our house?â she asked.
 46589	
 46590	The major raised his hand to his cap with a smile.
 46591	
 46592	âWhich one do you want, Maâamâselle?â said he, screwing up his eyes and
 46593	smiling.
 46594	
 46595	NatÃ¡sha quietly repeated her question, and her face and whole
 46596	manner were so serious, though she was still holding the ends of her
 46597	handkerchief, that the major ceased smiling and after some reflectionâas
 46598	if considering in how far the thing was possibleâreplied in the
 46599	affirmative.
 46600	
 46601	âOh yes, why not? They may,â he said.
 46602	
 46603	With a slight inclination of her head, NatÃ¡sha stepped back quickly to
 46604	MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna, who stood talking compassionately to the officer.
 46605	
 46606	âThey may. He says they may!â whispered NatÃ¡sha.
 46607	
 46608	The cart in which the officer lay was turned into the RostÃ³vsâ yard,
 46609	and dozens of carts with wounded men began at the invitation of the
 46610	townsfolk to turn into the yards and to draw up at the entrances of the
 46611	houses in PovarskÃ¡ya Street. NatÃ¡sha was evidently pleased to be dealing
 46612	with new people outside the ordinary routine of her life. She and MÃ¡vra
 46613	KuzmÃ­nichna tried to get as many of the wounded as possible into their
 46614	yard.
 46615	
 46616	âYour Papa must be told, though,â said MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna.
 46617	
 46618	âNever mind, never mind, what does it matter? For one day we can move
 46619	into the drawing room. They can have all our half of the house.â
 46620	
 46621	âThere now, young lady, you do take things into your head! Even if we
 46622	put them into the wing, the menâs room, or the nurseâs room, we must ask
 46623	permission.â
 46624	
 46625	âWell, Iâll ask.â
 46626	
 46627	NatÃ¡sha ran into the house and went on tiptoe through the half-open door
 46628	into the sitting room, where there was a smell of vinegar and Hoffmanâs
 46629	drops.
 46630	
 46631	âAre you asleep, Mamma?â
 46632	
 46633	âOh, what sleepâ?â said the countess, waking up just as she was dropping
 46634	into a doze.
 46635	
 46636	âMamma darling!â said NatÃ¡sha, kneeling by her mother and bringing her
 46637	face close to her motherâs, âI am sorry, forgive me, Iâll never do it
 46638	again; I woke you up! MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna has sent me: they have brought
 46639	some wounded hereâofficers. Will you let them come? They have nowhere to
 46640	go. I knew youâd let them come!â she said quickly all in one breath.
 46641	
 46642	âWhat officers? Whom have they brought? I donât understand anything
 46643	about it,â said the countess.
 46644	
 46645	NatÃ¡sha laughed, and the countess too smiled slightly.
 46646	
 46647	âI knew youâd give permission... so Iâll tell them,â and, having kissed
 46648	her mother, NatÃ¡sha got up and went to the door.
 46649	
 46650	In the hall she met her father, who had returned with bad news.
 46651	
 46652	âWeâve stayed too long!â said the count with involuntary vexation. âThe
 46653	Club is closed and the police are leaving.â
 46654	
 46655	âPapa, is it all rightâIâve invited some of the wounded into the house?â
 46656	said NatÃ¡sha.
 46657	
 46658	âOf course it is,â he answered absently. âThatâs not the point. I beg
 46659	you not to indulge in trifles now, but to help to pack, and tomorrow we
 46660	must go, go, go!...â
 46661	
 46662	And the count gave a similar order to the major-domo and the servants.
 46663	
 46664	At dinner PÃ©tya having returned home told them the news he had heard.
 46665	He said the people had been getting arms in the KrÃ©mlin, and that though
 46666	RostopchÃ­nâs broadsheet had said that he would sound a call two or three
 46667	days in advance, the order had certainly already been given for everyone
 46668	to go armed to the Three Hills tomorrow, and that there would be a big
 46669	battle there.
 46670	
 46671	The countess looked with timid horror at her sonâs eager, excited face
 46672	as he said this. She realized that if she said a word about his not
 46673	going to the battle (she knew he enjoyed the thought of the impending
 46674	engagement) he would say something about men, honor, and the
 46675	fatherlandâsomething senseless, masculine, and obstinate which there
 46676	would be no contradicting, and her plans would be spoiled; and so,
 46677	hoping to arrange to leave before then and take PÃ©tya with her as their
 46678	protector and defender, she did not answer him, but after dinner called
 46679	the count aside and implored him with tears to take her away quickly,
 46680	that very night if possible. With a womanâs involuntary loving cunning
 46681	she, who till then had not shown any alarm, said that she would die of
 46682	fright if they did not leave that very night. Without any pretense she
 46683	was now afraid of everything.
 46684	
 46685	
 46686	
 46687	
 46688	
 46689	CHAPTER XIV
 46690	
 46691	Madame Schoss, who had been out to visit her daughter, increased the
 46692	countessâ fears still more by telling what she had seen at a spirit
 46693	dealerâs in MyasnÃ­tski Street. When returning by that street she had
 46694	been unable to pass because of a drunken crowd rioting in front of
 46695	the shop. She had taken a cab and driven home by a side street and the
 46696	cabman had told her that the people were breaking open the barrels at
 46697	the drink store, having received orders to do so.
 46698	
 46699	After dinner the whole RostÃ³v household set to work with enthusiastic
 46700	haste packing their belongings and preparing for their departure. The
 46701	old count, suddenly setting to work, kept passing from the yard to the
 46702	house and back again, shouting confused instructions to the hurrying
 46703	people, and flurrying them still more. PÃ©tya directed things in the
 46704	yard. SÃ³nya, owing to the countâs contradictory orders, lost her head
 46705	and did not know what to do. The servants ran noisily about the house
 46706	and yard, shouting and disputing. NatÃ¡sha, with the ardor characteristic
 46707	of all she did suddenly set to work too. At first her intervention in
 46708	the business of packing was received skeptically. Everybody expected
 46709	some prank from her and did not wish to obey her; but she resolutely
 46710	and passionately demanded obedience, grew angry and nearly cried because
 46711	they did not heed her, and at last succeeded in making them believe her.
 46712	Her first exploit, which cost her immense effort and established her
 46713	authority, was the packing of the carpets. The count had valuable
 46714	Gobelin tapestries and Persian carpets in the house. When NatÃ¡sha set
 46715	to work two cases were standing open in the ballroom, one almost full
 46716	up with crockery, the other with carpets. There was also much china
 46717	standing on the tables, and still more was being brought in from the
 46718	storeroom. A third case was needed and servants had gone to fetch it.
 46719	
 46720	âSÃ³nya, wait a bitâweâll pack everything into these,â said NatÃ¡sha.
 46721	
 46722	âYou canât, Miss, we have tried to,â said the butlerâs assistant.
 46723	
 46724	âNo, wait a minute, please.â
 46725	
 46726	And NatÃ¡sha began rapidly taking out of the case dishes and plates
 46727	wrapped in paper.
 46728	
 46729	âThe dishes must go in here among the carpets,â said she.
 46730	
 46731	âWhy, itâs a mercy if we can get the carpets alone into three cases,â
 46732	said the butlerâs assistant.
 46733	
 46734	âOh, wait, please!â And NatÃ¡sha began rapidly and deftly sorting out the
 46735	things. âThese arenât needed,â said she, putting aside some plates
 46736	of Kiev ware. âTheseâyes, these must go among the carpets,â she said,
 46737	referring to the Saxony china dishes.
 46738	
 46739	âDonât, NatÃ¡sha! Leave it alone! Weâll get it all packed,â urged SÃ³nya
 46740	reproachfully.
 46741	
 46742	âWhat a young lady she is!â remarked the major-domo.
 46743	
 46744	But NatÃ¡sha would not give in. She turned everything out and began
 46745	quickly repacking, deciding that the inferior Russian carpets and
 46746	unnecessary crockery should not be taken at all. When everything had
 46747	been taken out of the cases, they recommenced packing, and it turned
 46748	out that when the cheaper things not worth taking had nearly all been
 46749	rejected, the valuable ones really did all go into the two cases. Only
 46750	the lid of the case containing the carpets would not shut down. A few
 46751	more things might have been taken out, but NatÃ¡sha insisted on having
 46752	her own way. She packed, repacked, pressed, made the butlerâs assistant
 46753	and PÃ©tyaâwhom she had drawn into the business of packingâpress on the
 46754	lid, and made desperate efforts herself.
 46755	
 46756	âThatâs enough, NatÃ¡sha,â said SÃ³nya. âI see you were right, but just
 46757	take out the top one.â
 46758	
 46759	âI wonât!â cried NatÃ¡sha, with one hand holding back the hair that hung
 46760	over her perspiring face, while with the other she pressed down the
 46761	carpets. âNow press, PÃ©tya! Press, VasÃ­lich, press hard!â she cried.
 46762	
 46763	The carpets yielded and the lid closed; NatÃ¡sha, clapping her hands,
 46764	screamed with delight and tears fell from her eyes. But this only
 46765	lasted a moment. She at once set to work afresh and they now trusted her
 46766	completely. The count was not angry even when they told him that NatÃ¡sha
 46767	had countermanded an order of his, and the servants now came to her
 46768	to ask whether a cart was sufficiently loaded, and whether it might
 46769	be corded up. Thanks to NatÃ¡shaâs directions the work now went on
 46770	expeditiously, unnecessary things were left, and the most valuable
 46771	packed as compactly as possible.
 46772	
 46773	But hard as they all worked till quite late that night, they could not
 46774	get everything packed. The countess had fallen asleep and the count,
 46775	having put off their departure till next morning, went to bed.
 46776	
 46777	SÃ³nya and NatÃ¡sha slept in the sitting room without undressing.
 46778	
 46779	That night another wounded man was driven down the PovarskÃ¡ya, and MÃ¡vra
 46780	KuzmÃ­nichna, who was standing at the gate, had him brought into the
 46781	RostÃ³vsâ yard. MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna concluded that he was a very important
 46782	man. He was being conveyed in a calÃ¨che with a raised hood, and was
 46783	quite covered by an apron. On the box beside the driver sat a venerable
 46784	old attendant. A doctor and two soldiers followed the carriage in a
 46785	cart.
 46786	
 46787	âPlease come in here. The masters are going away and the whole house
 46788	will be empty,â said the old woman to the old attendant.
 46789	
 46790	âWell, perhaps,â said he with a sigh. âWe donât expect to get him home
 46791	alive! We have a house of our own in Moscow, but itâs a long way from
 46792	here, and thereâs nobody living in it.â
 46793	
 46794	âDo us the honor to come in, thereâs plenty of everything in the
 46795	masterâs house. Come in,â said MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna. âIs he very ill?â she
 46796	asked.
 46797	
 46798	The attendant made a hopeless gesture.
 46799	
 46800	âWe donât expect to get him home! We must ask the doctor.â
 46801	
 46802	And the old servant got down from the box and went up to the cart.
 46803	
 46804	âAll right!â said the doctor.
 46805	
 46806	The old servant returned to the calÃ¨che, looked into it, shook his
 46807	head disconsolately, told the driver to turn into the yard, and stopped
 46808	beside MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna.
 46809	
 46810	âO, Lord Jesus Christ!â she murmured.
 46811	
 46812	She invited them to take the wounded man into the house.
 46813	
 46814	âThe masters wonât object...â she said.
 46815	
 46816	But they had to avoid carrying the man upstairs, and so they took him
 46817	into the wing and put him in the room that had been Madame Schossâ.
 46818	
 46819	This wounded man was Prince Andrew BolkÃ³nski.
 46820	
 46821	
 46822

 46824	
 46825	CHAPTER XV
 46826	
 46827	Moscowâs last day had come. It was a clear bright autumn day, a Sunday.
 46828	The church bells everywhere were ringing for service, just as usual on
 46829	Sundays. Nobody seemed yet to realize what awaited the city.
 46830	
 46831	Only two things indicated the social condition of Moscowâthe rabble,
 46832	that is the poor people, and the price of commodities. An enormous crowd
 46833	of factory hands, house serfs, and peasants, with whom some officials,
 46834	seminarists, and gentry were mingled, had gone early that morning to
 46835	the Three Hills. Having waited there for RostopchÃ­n who did not turn
 46836	up, they became convinced that Moscow would be surrendered, and then
 46837	dispersed all about the town to the public houses and cookshops. Prices
 46838	too that day indicated the state of affairs. The price of weapons, of
 46839	gold, of carts and horses, kept rising, but the value of paper money and
 46840	city articles kept falling, so that by midday there were instances of
 46841	carters removing valuable goods, such as cloth, and receiving in payment
 46842	a half of what they carted, while peasant horses were fetching five
 46843	hundred rubles each, and furniture, mirrors, and bronzes were being
 46844	given away for nothing.
 46845	
 46846	In the RostÃ³vsâ staid old-fashioned house the dissolution of former
 46847	conditions of life was but little noticeable. As to the serfs the only
 46848	indication was that three out of their huge retinue disappeared
 46849	during the night, but nothing was stolen; and as to the value of their
 46850	possessions, the thirty peasant carts that had come in from their
 46851	estates and which many people envied proved to be extremely valuable and
 46852	they were offered enormous sums of money for them. Not only were huge
 46853	sums offered for the horses and carts, but on the previous evening and
 46854	early in the morning of the first of September, orderlies and servants
 46855	sent by wounded officers came to the RostÃ³vsâ and wounded men dragged
 46856	themselves there from the RostÃ³vsâ and from neighboring houses where
 46857	they were accommodated, entreating the servants to try to get them
 46858	a lift out of Moscow. The major-domo to whom these entreaties were
 46859	addressed, though he was sorry for the wounded, resolutely refused,
 46860	saying that he dare not even mention the matter to the count. Pity these
 46861	wounded men as one might, it was evident that if they were given one
 46862	cart there would be no reason to refuse another, or all the carts and
 46863	oneâs own carriages as well. Thirty carts could not save all the wounded
 46864	and in the general catastrophe one could not disregard oneself and oneâs
 46865	own family. So thought the major-domo on his masterâs behalf.
 46866	
 46867	On waking up that morning Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v left his bedroom softly, so
 46868	as not to wake the countess who had fallen asleep only toward morning,
 46869	and came out to the porch in his lilac silk dressing gown. In the yard
 46870	stood the carts ready corded. The carriages were at the front porch.
 46871	The major-domo stood at the porch talking to an elderly orderly and to
 46872	a pale young officer with a bandaged arm. On seeing the count the
 46873	major-domo made a significant and stern gesture to them both to go away.
 46874	
 46875	âWell, VasÃ­lich, is everything ready?â asked the count, and stroking his
 46876	bald head he looked good-naturedly at the officer and the orderly and
 46877	nodded to them. (He liked to see new faces.)
 46878	
 46879	âWe can harness at once, your excellency.â
 46880	
 46881	âWell, thatâs right. As soon as the countess wakes weâll be off, God
 46882	willing! What is it, gentlemen?â he added, turning to the officer. âAre
 46883	you staying in my house?â
 46884	
 46885	The officer came nearer and suddenly his face flushed crimson.
 46886	
 46887	âCount, be so good as to allow me... for Godâs sake, to get into some
 46888	corner of one of your carts! I have nothing here with me.... I shall be
 46889	all right on a loaded cart....â
 46890	
 46891	Before the officer had finished speaking the orderly made the same
 46892	request on behalf of his master.
 46893	
 46894	âOh, yes, yes, yes!â said the count hastily. âI shall be very pleased,
 46895	very pleased. VasÃ­lich, youâll see to it. Just unload one or two carts.
 46896	Well, what of it... do whatâs necessary...â said the count, muttering
 46897	some indefinite order.
 46898	
 46899	But at the same moment an expression of warm gratitude on the officerâs
 46900	face had already sealed the order. The count looked around him. In the
 46901	yard, at the gates, at the window of the wings, wounded officers and
 46902	their orderlies were to be seen. They were all looking at the count and
 46903	moving toward the porch.
 46904	
 46905	âPlease step into the gallery, your excellency,â said the major-domo.
 46906	âWhat are your orders about the pictures?â
 46907	
 46908	The count went into the house with him, repeating his order not to
 46909	refuse the wounded who asked for a lift.
 46910	
 46911	âWell, never mind, some of the things can be unloaded,â he added in a
 46912	soft, confidential voice, as though afraid of being overheard.
 46913	
 46914	At nine oâclock the countess woke up, and MatrÃ«na TimofÃ©evna, who had
 46915	been her ladyâs maid before her marriage and now performed a sort of
 46916	chief gendarmeâs duty for her, came to say that Madame Schoss was much
 46917	offended and the young ladiesâ summer dresses could not be left behind.
 46918	On inquiry, the countess learned that Madame Schoss was offended because
 46919	her trunk had been taken down from its cart, and all the loads were
 46920	being uncorded and the luggage taken out of the carts to make room for
 46921	wounded men whom the count in the simplicity of his heart had ordered
 46922	that they should take with them. The countess sent for her husband.
 46923	
 46924	âWhat is this, my dear? I hear that the luggage is being unloaded.â
 46925	
 46926	âYou know, love, I wanted to tell you... Countess dear... an officer
 46927	came to me to ask for a few carts for the wounded. After all, ours are
 46928	things that can be bought but think what being left behind means to
 46929	them!... Really now, in our own yardâwe asked them in ourselves and
 46930	there are officers among them.... You know, I think, my dear... let them
 46931	be taken... whereâs the hurry?â
 46932	
 46933	The count spoke timidly, as he always did when talking of money matters.
 46934	The countess was accustomed to this tone as a precursor of news of
 46935	something detrimental to the childrenâs interests, such as the building
 46936	of a new gallery or conservatory, the inauguration of a private theater
 46937	or an orchestra. She was accustomed always to oppose anything announced
 46938	in that timid tone and considered it her duty to do so.
 46939	
 46940	She assumed her dolefully submissive manner and said to her husband:
 46941	âListen to me, Count, you have managed matters so that we are getting
 46942	nothing for the house, and now you wish to throw away all ourâall the
 46943	childrenâs property! You said yourself that we have a hundred thousand
 46944	rublesâ worth of things in the house. I donât consent, my dear, I donât!
 46945	Do as you please! Itâs the governmentâs business to look after the
 46946	wounded; they know that. Look at the LopukhÃ­ns opposite, they cleared
 46947	out everything two days ago. Thatâs what other people do. Itâs only
 46948	we who are such fools. If you have no pity on me, have some for the
 46949	children.â
 46950	
 46951	Flourishing his arms in despair the count left the room without
 46952	replying.
 46953	
 46954	âPapa, what are you doing that for?â asked NatÃ¡sha, who had followed him
 46955	into her motherâs room.
 46956	
 46957	âNothing! What business is it of yours?â muttered the count angrily.
 46958	
 46959	âBut I heard,â said NatÃ¡sha. âWhy does Mamma object?â
 46960	
 46961	âWhat business is it of yours?â cried the count.
 46962	
 46963	NatÃ¡sha stepped up to the window and pondered.
 46964	
 46965	âPapa! Hereâs Berg coming to see us,â said she, looking out of the
 46966	window.
 46967	
 46968	
 46969	
 46970	
 46971	
 46972	CHAPTER XVI
 46973	
 46974	Berg, the RostÃ³vsâ son-in-law, was already a colonel wearing the orders
 46975	of VladÃ­mir and Anna, and he still filled the quiet and agreeable post
 46976	of assistant to the head of the staff of the assistant commander of the
 46977	first division of the Second Army.
 46978	
 46979	On the first of September he had come to Moscow from the army.
 46980	
 46981	He had nothing to do in Moscow, but he had noticed that everyone in the
 46982	army was asking for leave to visit Moscow and had something to do there.
 46983	So he considered it necessary to ask for leave of absence for family and
 46984	domestic reasons.
 46985	
 46986	Berg drove up to his father-in-lawâs house in his spruce little trap
 46987	with a pair of sleek roans, exactly like those of a certain prince. He
 46988	looked attentively at the carts in the yard and while going up to the
 46989	porch took out a clean pocket handkerchief and tied a knot in it.
 46990	
 46991	From the anteroom Berg ran with smooth though impatient steps into the
 46992	drawing room, where he embraced the count, kissed the hands of NatÃ¡sha
 46993	and SÃ³nya, and hastened to inquire after âMammaâsâ health.
 46994	
 46995	âHealth, at a time like this?â said the count. âCome, tell us the news!
 46996	Is the army retreating or will there be another battle?â
 46997	
 46998	âGod Almighty alone can decide the fate of our fatherland, Papa,â said
 46999	Berg. âThe army is burning with a spirit of heroism and the leaders, so
 47000	to say, have now assembled in council. No one knows what is coming. But
 47001	in general I can tell you, Papa, that such a heroic spirit, the truly
 47002	antique valor of the Russian army, which theyâwhich itâ (he corrected
 47003	himself) âhas shown or displayed in the battle of the twenty-sixthâthere
 47004	are no words worthy to do it justice! I tell you, Papaâ (he smote
 47005	himself on the breast as a general he had heard speaking had done, but
 47006	Berg did it a trifle late for he should have struck his breast at the
 47007	words âRussian armyâ), âI tell you frankly that we, the commanders, far
 47008	from having to urge the men on or anything of that kind, could hardly
 47009	restrain those... those... yes, those exploits of antique valor,â he
 47010	went on rapidly. âGeneral Barclay de Tolly risked his life everywhere at
 47011	the head of the troops, I can assure you. Our corps was stationed on a
 47012	hillside. You can imagine!â
 47013	
 47014	And Berg related all that he remembered of the various tales he had
 47015	heard those days. NatÃ¡sha watched him with an intent gaze that confused
 47016	him, as if she were trying to find in his face the answer to some
 47017	question.
 47018	
 47019	âAltogether such heroism as was displayed by the Russian warriors
 47020	cannot be imagined or adequately praised!â said Berg, glancing round
 47021	at NatÃ¡sha, and as if anxious to conciliate her, replying to her intent
 47022	look with a smile. ââRussia is not in Moscow, she lives in the hearts of
 47023	her sons!â Isnât it so, Papa?â said he.
 47024	
 47025	Just then the countess came in from the sitting room with a weary and
 47026	dissatisfied expression. Berg hurriedly jumped up, kissed her hand,
 47027	asked about her health, and, swaying his head from side to side to
 47028	express sympathy, remained standing beside her.
 47029	
 47030	âYes, Mamma, I tell you sincerely that these are hard and sad times for
 47031	every Russian. But why are you so anxious? You have still time to get
 47032	away....â
 47033	
 47034	âI canât think what the servants are about,â said the countess, turning
 47035	to her husband. âI have just been told that nothing is ready yet.
 47036	Somebody after all must see to things. One misses MÃ­tenka at such times.
 47037	There wonât be any end to it.â
 47038	
 47039	The count was about to say something, but evidently restrained himself.
 47040	He got up from his chair and went to the door.
 47041	
 47042	At that moment Berg drew out his handkerchief as if to blow his nose
 47043	and, seeing the knot in it, pondered, shaking his head sadly and
 47044	significantly.
 47045	
 47046	âAnd I have a great favor to ask of you, Papa,â said he.
 47047	
 47048	âHm...â said the count, and stopped.
 47049	
 47050	âI was driving past YusÃºpovâs house just now,â said Berg with a laugh,
 47051	âwhen the steward, a man I know, ran out and asked me whether I wouldnât
 47052	buy something. I went in out of curiosity, you know, and there is a
 47053	small chiffonier and a dressing table. You know how dear VÃ©ra wanted a
 47054	chiffonier like that and how we had a dispute about it.â (At the mention
 47055	of the chiffonier and dressing table Berg involuntarily changed his tone
 47056	to one of pleasure at his admirable domestic arrangements.) âAnd itâs
 47057	such a beauty! It pulls out and has a secret English drawer, you know!
 47058	And dear VÃ©ra has long wanted one. I wish to give her a surprise, you
 47059	see. I saw so many of those peasant carts in your yard. Please let me
 47060	have one, I will pay the man well, and...â
 47061	
 47062	The count frowned and coughed.
 47063	
 47064	âAsk the countess, I donât give orders.â
 47065	
 47066	âIf itâs inconvenient, please donât,â said Berg. âOnly I so wanted it,
 47067	for dear VÃ©raâs sake.â
 47068	
 47069	âOh, go to the devil, all of you! To the devil, the devil, the devil...â
 47070	cried the old count. âMy headâs in a whirl!â
 47071	
 47072	And he left the room. The countess began to cry.
 47073	
 47074	âYes, Mamma! Yes, these are very hard times!â said Berg.
 47075	
 47076	NatÃ¡sha left the room with her father and, as if finding it difficult to
 47077	reach some decision, first followed him and then ran downstairs.
 47078	
 47079	PÃ©tya was in the porch, engaged in giving out weapons to the servants
 47080	who were to leave Moscow. The loaded carts were still standing in the
 47081	yard. Two of them had been uncorded and a wounded officer was climbing
 47082	into one of them helped by an orderly.
 47083	
 47084	âDo you know what itâs about?â PÃ©tya asked NatÃ¡sha.
 47085	
 47086	She understood that he meant what were their parents quarreling about.
 47087	She did not answer.
 47088	
 47089	âItâs because Papa wanted to give up all the carts to the wounded,â said
 47090	PÃ©tya. âVasÃ­lich told me. I consider...â
 47091	
 47092	âI consider,â NatÃ¡sha suddenly almost shouted, turning her angry face to
 47093	PÃ©tya, âI consider it so horrid, so abominable, so... I donât know what.
 47094	Are we despicable Germans?â
 47095	
 47096	Her throat quivered with convulsive sobs and, afraid of weakening and
 47097	letting the force of her anger run to waste, she turned and rushed
 47098	headlong up the stairs.
 47099	
 47100	Berg was sitting beside the countess consoling her with the respectful
 47101	attention of a relative. The count, pipe in hand, was pacing up and down
 47102	the room, when NatÃ¡sha, her face distorted by anger, burst in like a
 47103	tempest and approached her mother with rapid steps.
 47104	
 47105	âItâs horrid! Itâs abominable!â she screamed. âYou canât possibly have
 47106	ordered it!â
 47107	
 47108	Berg and the countess looked at her, perplexed and frightened. The count
 47109	stood still at the window and listened.
 47110	
 47111	âMamma, itâs impossible: see what is going on in the yard!â she cried.
 47112	âThey will be left!...â
 47113	
 47114	âWhatâs the matter with you? Who are âtheyâ? What do you want?â
 47115	
 47116	âWhy, the wounded! Itâs impossible, Mamma. Itâs monstrous!... No, Mamma
 47117	darling, itâs not the thing. Please forgive me, darling.... Mamma, what
 47118	does it matter what we take away? Only look what is going on in the
 47119	yard... Mamma!... Itâs impossible!â
 47120	
 47121	The count stood by the window and listened without turning round.
 47122	Suddenly he sniffed and put his face closer to the window.
 47123	
 47124	The countess glanced at her daughter, saw her face full of shame for her
 47125	mother, saw her agitation, and understood why her husband did not turn
 47126	to look at her now, and she glanced round quite disconcerted.
 47127	
 47128	âOh, do as you like! Am I hindering anyone?â she said, not surrendering
 47129	at once.
 47130	
 47131	âMamma, darling, forgive me!â
 47132	
 47133	But the countess pushed her daughter away and went up to her husband.
 47134	
 47135	âMy dear, you order what is right.... You know I donât understand about
 47136	it,â said she, dropping her eyes shamefacedly.
 47137	
 47138	âThe eggs... the eggs are teaching the hen,â muttered the count through
 47139	tears of joy, and he embraced his wife who was glad to hide her look of
 47140	shame on his breast.
 47141	
 47142	âPapa! Mamma! May I see to it? May I?...â asked NatÃ¡sha. âWe will still
 47143	take all the most necessary things.â
 47144	
 47145	The count nodded affirmatively, and NatÃ¡sha, at the rapid pace at which
 47146	she used to run when playing at tag, ran through the ballroom to the
 47147	anteroom and downstairs into the yard.
 47148	
 47149	The servants gathered round NatÃ¡sha, but could not believe the strange
 47150	order she brought them until the count himself, in his wifeâs name,
 47151	confirmed the order to give up all the carts to the wounded and take the
 47152	trunks to the storerooms. When they understood that order the servants
 47153	set to work at this new task with pleasure and zeal. It no longer seemed
 47154	strange to them but on the contrary it seemed the only thing that could
 47155	be done, just as a quarter of an hour before it had not seemed strange
 47156	to anyone that the wounded should be left behind and the goods carted
 47157	away but that had seemed the only thing to do.
 47158	
 47159	The whole household, as if to atone for not having done it sooner, set
 47160	eagerly to work at the new task of placing the wounded in the carts. The
 47161	wounded dragged themselves out of their rooms and stood with pale but
 47162	happy faces round the carts. The news that carts were to be had spread
 47163	to the neighboring houses, from which wounded men began to come into the
 47164	RostÃ³vsâ yard. Many of the wounded asked them not to unload the carts
 47165	but only to let them sit on the top of the things. But the work of
 47166	unloading, once started, could not be arrested. It seemed not to matter
 47167	whether all or only half the things were left behind. Cases full of
 47168	china, bronzes, pictures, and mirrors that had been so carefully
 47169	packed the night before now lay about the yard, and still they went on
 47170	searching for and finding possibilities of unloading this or that and
 47171	letting the wounded have another and yet another cart.
 47172	
 47173	âWe can take four more men,â said the steward. âThey can have my trap,
 47174	or else what is to become of them?â
 47175	
 47176	âLet them have my wardrobe cart,â said the countess. âDunyÃ¡sha can go
 47177	with me in the carriage.â
 47178	
 47179	They unloaded the wardrobe cart and sent it to take wounded men from a
 47180	house two doors off. The whole household, servants included, was bright
 47181	and animated. NatÃ¡sha was in a state of rapturous excitement such as she
 47182	had not known for a long time.
 47183	
 47184	âWhat could we fasten this onto?â asked the servants, trying to fix a
 47185	trunk on the narrow footboard behind a carriage. âWe must keep at least
 47186	one cart.â
 47187	
 47188	âWhatâs in it?â asked NatÃ¡sha.
 47189	
 47190	âThe countâs books.â
 47191	
 47192	âLeave it, VasÃ­lich will put it away. Itâs not wanted.â
 47193	
 47194	The phaeton was full of people and there was a doubt as to where Count
 47195	Peter could sit.
 47196	
 47197	âOn the box. Youâll sit on the box, wonât you, PÃ©tya?â cried NatÃ¡sha.
 47198	
 47199	SÃ³nya too was busy all this time, but the aim of her efforts was quite
 47200	different from NatÃ¡shaâs. She was putting away the things that had to
 47201	be left behind and making a list of them as the countess wished, and she
 47202	tried to get as much taken away with them as possible.
 47203

 47208	CHAPTER XVII
 47209	
 47210	Before two oâclock in the afternoon the RostÃ³vsâ four carriages, packed
 47211	full and with the horses harnessed, stood at the front door. One by one
 47212	the carts with the wounded had moved out of the yard.
 47213	
 47214	The calÃ¨che in which Prince Andrew was being taken attracted SÃ³nyaâs
 47215	attention as it passed the front porch. With the help of a maid she was
 47216	arranging a seat for the countess in the huge high coach that stood at
 47217	the entrance.
 47218	
 47219	âWhose calÃ¨che is that?â she inquired, leaning out of the carriage
 47220	window.
 47221	
 47222	âWhy, didnât you know, Miss?â replied the maid. âThe wounded prince: he
 47223	spent the night in our house and is going with us.â
 47224	
 47225	âBut who is it? Whatâs his name?â
 47226	
 47227	âItâs our intended that wasâPrince BolkÃ³nski himself! They say he is
 47228	dying,â replied the maid with a sigh.
 47229	
 47230	SÃ³nya jumped out of the coach and ran to the countess. The countess,
 47231	tired out and already dressed in shawl and bonnet for her journey,
 47232	was pacing up and down the drawing room, waiting for the household to
 47233	assemble for the usual silent prayer with closed doors before starting.
 47234	NatÃ¡sha was not in the room.
 47235	
 47236	âMamma,â said SÃ³nya, âPrince Andrew is here, mortally wounded. He is
 47237	going with us.â
 47238	
 47239	The countess opened her eyes in dismay and, seizing SÃ³nyaâs arm, glanced
 47240	around.
 47241	
 47242	âNatÃ¡sha?â she murmured.
 47243	
 47244	At that moment this news had only one significance for both of them.
 47245	They knew their NatÃ¡sha, and alarm as to what would happen if she heard
 47246	this news stifled all sympathy for the man they both liked.
 47247	
 47248	âNatÃ¡sha does not know yet, but he is going with us,â said SÃ³nya.
 47249	
 47250	âYou say he is dying?â
 47251	
 47252	SÃ³nya nodded.
 47253	
 47254	The countess put her arms around SÃ³nya and began to cry.
 47255	
 47256	âThe ways of God are past finding out!â she thought, feeling that the
 47257	Almighty Hand, hitherto unseen, was becoming manifest in all that was
 47258	now taking place.
 47259	
 47260	âWell, Mamma? Everything is ready. Whatâs the matter?â asked NatÃ¡sha, as
 47261	with animated face she ran into the room.
 47262	
 47263	âNothing,â answered the countess. âIf everything is ready let us start.â
 47264	
 47265	And the countess bent over her reticule to hide her agitated face. SÃ³nya
 47266	embraced NatÃ¡sha and kissed her.
 47267	
 47268	NatÃ¡sha looked at her inquiringly.
 47269	
 47270	âWhat is it? What has happened?â
 47271	
 47272	âNothing... No...â
 47273	
 47274	âIs it something very bad for me? What is it?â persisted NatÃ¡sha with
 47275	her quick intuition.
 47276	
 47277	SÃ³nya sighed and made no reply. The count, PÃ©tya, Madame Schoss, MÃ¡vra
 47278	KuzmÃ­nichna, and VasÃ­lich came into the drawing room and, having closed
 47279	the doors, they all sat down and remained for some moments silently
 47280	seated without looking at one another.
 47281	
 47282	The count was the first to rise, and with a loud sigh crossed himself
 47283	before the icon. All the others did the same. Then the count embraced
 47284	MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna and VasÃ­lich, who were to remain in Moscow, and while
 47285	they caught at his hand and kissed his shoulder he patted their backs
 47286	lightly with some vaguely affectionate and comforting words. The
 47287	countess went into the oratory and there SÃ³nya found her on her knees
 47288	before the icons that had been left here and there hanging on the wall.
 47289	(The most precious ones, with which some family tradition was connected,
 47290	were being taken with them.)
 47291	
 47292	In the porch and in the yard the men whom PÃ©tya had armed with swords
 47293	and daggers, with trousers tucked inside their high boots and with belts
 47294	and girdles tightened, were taking leave of those remaining behind.
 47295	
 47296	As is always the case at a departure, much had been forgotten or put in
 47297	the wrong place, and for a long time two menservants stood one on
 47298	each side of the open door and the carriage steps waiting to help the
 47299	countess in, while maids rushed with cushions and bundles from the house
 47300	to the carriages, the calÃ¨che, the phaeton, and back again.
 47301	
 47302	âThey always will forget everything!â said the countess. âDonât you know
 47303	I canât sit like that?â
 47304	
 47305	And DunyÃ¡sha, with clenched teeth, without replying but with an
 47306	aggrieved look on her face, hastily got into the coach to rearrange the
 47307	seat.
 47308	
 47309	âOh, those servants!â said the count, swaying his head.
 47310	
 47311	EfÃ­m, the old coachman, who was the only one the countess trusted to
 47312	drive her, sat perched up high on the box and did not so much as glance
 47313	round at what was going on behind him. From thirty yearsâ experience
 47314	he knew it would be some time yet before the order, âBe off, in Godâs
 47315	name!â would be given him: and he knew that even when it was said
 47316	he would be stopped once or twice more while they sent back to fetch
 47317	something that had been forgotten, and even after that he would again
 47318	be stopped and the countess herself would lean out of the window and beg
 47319	him for the love of heaven to drive carefully down the hill. He knew
 47320	all this and therefore waited calmly for what would happen, with more
 47321	patience than the horses, especially the near one, the chestnut Falcon,
 47322	who was pawing the ground and champing his bit. At last all were
 47323	seated, the carriage steps were folded and pulled up, the door was shut,
 47324	somebody was sent for a traveling case, and the countess leaned out
 47325	and said what she had to say. Then EfÃ­m deliberately doffed his hat and
 47326	began crossing himself. The postilion and all the other servants did the
 47327	same. âOff, in Godâs name!â said EfÃ­m, putting on his hat. âStart!â The
 47328	postilion started the horses, the off pole horse tugged at his collar,
 47329	the high springs creaked, and the body of the coach swayed. The footman
 47330	sprang onto the box of the moving coach which jolted as it passed out
 47331	of the yard onto the uneven roadway; the other vehicles jolted in
 47332	their turn, and the procession of carriages moved up the street. In the
 47333	carriages, the calÃ¨che, and the phaeton, all crossed themselves as they
 47334	passed the church opposite the house. Those who were to remain in Moscow
 47335	walked on either side of the vehicles seeing the travelers off.
 47336	
 47337	Rarely had NatÃ¡sha experienced so joyful a feeling as now, sitting in
 47338	the carriage beside the countess and gazing at the slowly receding
 47339	walls of forsaken, agitated Moscow. Occasionally she leaned out of the
 47340	carriage window and looked back and then forward at the long train of
 47341	wounded in front of them. Almost at the head of the line she could see
 47342	the raised hood of Prince Andrewâs calÃ¨che. She did not know who was
 47343	in it, but each time she looked at the procession her eyes sought that
 47344	calÃ¨che. She knew it was right in front.
 47345	
 47346	In KÃºdrino, from the NikÃ­tski, PrÃ©snya, and PodnovÃ­nsk Streets came
 47347	several other trains of vehicles similar to the RostÃ³vsâ, and as they
 47348	passed along the SadÃ³vaya Street the carriages and carts formed two rows
 47349	abreast.
 47350	
 47351	As they were going round the SÃºkharev water tower NatÃ¡sha, who was
 47352	inquisitively and alertly scrutinizing the people driving or walking
 47353	past, suddenly cried out in joyful surprise:
 47354	
 47355	âDear me! Mamma, SÃ³nya, look, itâs he!â
 47356	
 47357	âWho? Who?â
 47358	
 47359	âLook! Yes, on my word, itâs BezÃºkhov!â said NatÃ¡sha, putting her head
 47360	out of the carriage and staring at a tall, stout man in a coachmanâs
 47361	long coat, who from his manner of walking and moving was evidently
 47362	a gentleman in disguise, and who was passing under the arch of the
 47363	SÃºkharev tower accompanied by a small, sallow-faced, beardless old man
 47364	in a frieze coat.
 47365	
 47366	âYes, it really is BezÃºkhov in a coachmanâs coat, with a queer-looking
 47367	old boy. Really,â said NatÃ¡sha, âlook, look!â
 47368	
 47369	âNo, itâs not he. How can you talk such nonsense?â
 47370	
 47371	âMamma,â screamed NatÃ¡sha, âIâll stake my head itâs he! I assure you!
 47372	Stop, stop!â she cried to the coachman.
 47373	
 47374	But the coachman could not stop, for from the MeshchÃ¡nski Street came
 47375	more carts and carriages, and the RostÃ³vs were being shouted at to move
 47376	on and not block the way.
 47377	
 47378	In fact, however, though now much farther off than before, the RostÃ³vs
 47379	all saw Pierreâor someone extraordinarily like himâin a coachmanâs coat,
 47380	going down the street with head bent and a serious face beside a small,
 47381	beardless old man who looked like a footman. That old man noticed a
 47382	face thrust out of the carriage window gazing at them, and respectfully
 47383	touching Pierreâs elbow said something to him and pointed to the
 47384	carriage. Pierre, evidently engrossed in thought, could not at first
 47385	understand him. At length when he had understood and looked in the
 47386	direction the old man indicated, he recognized NatÃ¡sha, and following
 47387	his first impulse stepped instantly and rapidly toward the coach. But
 47388	having taken a dozen steps he seemed to remember something and stopped.
 47389	
 47390	NatÃ¡shaâs face, leaning out of the window, beamed with quizzical
 47391	kindliness.
 47392	
 47393	âPeter KirÃ­lovich, come here! We have recognized you! This is
 47394	wonderful!â she cried, holding out her hand to him. âWhat are you doing?
 47395	Why are you like this?â
 47396	
 47397	Pierre took her outstretched hand and kissed it awkwardly as he walked
 47398	along beside her while the coach still moved on.
 47399	
 47400	âWhat is the matter, Count?â asked the countess in a surprised and
 47401	commiserating tone.
 47402	
 47403	âWhat? What? Why? Donât ask me,â said Pierre, and looked round at
 47404	NatÃ¡sha whose radiant, happy expressionâof which he was conscious
 47405	without looking at herâfilled him with enchantment.
 47406	
 47407	âAre you remaining in Moscow, then?â
 47408	
 47409	Pierre hesitated.
 47410	
 47411	âIn Moscow?â he said in a questioning tone. âYes, in Moscow. Good-by!â
 47412	
 47413	âAh, if only I were a man! Iâd certainly stay with you. How splendid!â
 47414	said NatÃ¡sha. âMamma, if youâll let me, Iâll stay!â
 47415	
 47416	Pierre glanced absently at NatÃ¡sha and was about to say something, but
 47417	the countess interrupted him.
 47418	
 47419	âYou were at the battle, we heard.â
 47420	
 47421	âYes, I was,â Pierre answered. âThere will be another battle
 47422	tomorrow...â he began, but NatÃ¡sha interrupted him.
 47423	
 47424	âBut what is the matter with you, Count? You are not like yourself....â
 47425	
 47426	âOh, donât ask me, donât ask me! I donât know myself. Tomorrow... But
 47427	no! Good-by, good-by!â he muttered. âItâs an awful time!â and dropping
 47428	behind the carriage he stepped onto the pavement.
 47429	
 47430	NatÃ¡sha continued to lean out of the window for a long time, beaming at
 47431	him with her kindly, slightly quizzical, happy smile.
 47432	
 47433	
 47434	
 47435	
 47436	
 47437	CHAPTER XVIII
 47438	
 47439	For the last two days, ever since leaving home, Pierre had been living
 47440	in the empty house of his deceased benefactor, BazdÃ©ev. This is how it
 47441	happened.
 47442	
 47443	When he woke up on the morning after his return to Moscow and his
 47444	interview with Count RostopchÃ­n, he could not for some time make out
 47445	where he was and what was expected of him. When he was informed that
 47446	among others awaiting him in his reception room there was a Frenchman
 47447	who had brought a letter from his wife, the Countess HÃ©lÃ¨ne, he felt
 47448	suddenly overcome by that sense of confusion and hopelessness to which
 47449	he was apt to succumb. He felt that everything was now at an end, all
 47450	was in confusion and crumbling to pieces, that nobody was right or
 47451	wrong, the future held nothing, and there was no escape from this
 47452	position. Smiling unnaturally and muttering to himself, he first sat
 47453	down on the sofa in an attitude of despair, then rose, went to the door
 47454	of the reception room and peeped through the crack, returned flourishing
 47455	his arms, and took up a book. His major-domo came in a second time to
 47456	say that the Frenchman who had brought the letter from the countess
 47457	was very anxious to see him if only for a minute, and that someone from
 47458	BazdÃ©evâs widow had called to ask Pierre to take charge of her husbandâs
 47459	books, as she herself was leaving for the country.
 47460	
 47461	âOh, yes, in a minute; wait... or no! No, of course... go and say I will
 47462	come directly,â Pierre replied to the major-domo.
 47463	
 47464	But as soon as the man had left the room Pierre took up his hat which
 47465	was lying on the table and went out of his study by the other door.
 47466	There was no one in the passage. He went along the whole length of this
 47467	passage to the stairs and, frowning and rubbing his forehead with
 47468	both hands, went down as far as the first landing. The hall porter was
 47469	standing at the front door. From the landing where Pierre stood there
 47470	was a second staircase leading to the back entrance. He went down that
 47471	staircase and out into the yard. No one had seen him. But there were
 47472	some carriages waiting, and as soon as Pierre stepped out of the gate
 47473	the coachmen and the yard porter noticed him and raised their caps to
 47474	him. When he felt he was being looked at he behaved like an ostrich
 47475	which hides its head in a bush in order not to be seen: he hung his head
 47476	and quickening his pace went down the street.
 47477	
 47478	Of all the affairs awaiting Pierre that day the sorting of Joseph
 47479	BazdÃ©evâs books and papers appeared to him the most necessary.
 47480	
 47481	He hired the first cab he met and told the driver to go to the
 47482	Patriarchâs Ponds, where the widow BazdÃ©evâs house was.
 47483	
 47484	Continually turning round to look at the rows of loaded carts that were
 47485	making their way from all sides out of Moscow, and balancing his bulky
 47486	body so as not to slip out of the ramshackle old vehicle, Pierre,
 47487	experiencing the joyful feeling of a boy escaping from school, began to
 47488	talk to his driver.
 47489	
 47490	The man told him that arms were being distributed today at the KrÃ©mlin
 47491	and that tomorrow everyone would be sent out beyond the Three Hills
 47492	gates and a great battle would be fought there.
 47493	
 47494	Having reached the Patriarchâs Ponds Pierre found the BazdÃ©evsâ house,
 47495	where he had not been for a long time past. He went up to the gate.
 47496	GerÃ¡sim, that sallow beardless old man Pierre had seen at TorzhÃ³k five
 47497	years before with Joseph BazdÃ©ev, came out in answer to his knock.
 47498	
 47499	âAt home?â asked Pierre.
 47500	
 47501	âOwing to the present state of things Sophia DanÃ­lovna has gone to the
 47502	TorzhÃ³k estate with the children, your excellency.â
 47503	
 47504	âI will come in all the same, I have to look through the books,â said
 47505	Pierre.
 47506	
 47507	âBe so good as to step in. MakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich, the brother of my late
 47508	masterâmay the kingdom of heaven be hisâhas remained here, but he is in
 47509	a weak state as you know,â said the old servant.
 47510	
 47511	Pierre knew that MakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich was Joseph BazdÃ©evâs half-insane
 47512	brother and a hard drinker.
 47513	
 47514	âYes, yes, I know. Let us go in...â said Pierre and entered the house.
 47515	
 47516	A tall, bald-headed old man with a red nose, wearing a dressing gown and
 47517	with galoshes on his bare feet, stood in the anteroom. On seeing Pierre
 47518	he muttered something angrily and went away along the passage.
 47519	
 47520	âHe was a very clever man but has now grown quite feeble, as your honor
 47521	sees,â said GerÃ¡sim. âWill you step into the study?â Pierre nodded. âAs
 47522	it was sealed up so it has remained, but Sophia DanÃ­lovna gave orders
 47523	that if anyone should come from you they were to have the books.â
 47524	
 47525	Pierre went into that gloomy study which he had entered with such
 47526	trepidation in his benefactorâs lifetime. The room, dusty and untouched
 47527	since the death of Joseph BazdÃ©ev was now even gloomier.
 47528	
 47529	GerÃ¡sim opened one of the shutters and left the room on tiptoe. Pierre
 47530	went round the study, approached the cupboard in which the manuscripts
 47531	were kept, and took out what had once been one of the most important,
 47532	the holy of holies of the order. This was the authentic Scotch Acts
 47533	with BazdÃ©evâs notes and explanations. He sat down at the dusty writing
 47534	table, and, having laid the manuscripts before him, opened them out,
 47535	closed them, finally pushed them away, and resting his head on his hand
 47536	sank into meditation.
 47537	
 47538	GerÃ¡sim looked cautiously into the study several times and saw Pierre
 47539	always sitting in the same attitude.
 47540	
 47541	More than two hours passed and GerÃ¡sim took the liberty of making a
 47542	slight noise at the door to attract his attention, but Pierre did not
 47543	hear him.
 47544	
 47545	âIs the cabman to be discharged, your honor?â
 47546	
 47547	âOh yes!â said Pierre, rousing himself and rising hurriedly. âLook
 47548	here,â he added, taking GerÃ¡sim by a button of his coat and looking down
 47549	at the old man with moist, shining, and ecstatic eyes, âI say, do you
 47550	know that there is going to be a battle tomorrow?â
 47551	
 47552	âWe heard so,â replied the man.
 47553	
 47554	âI beg you not to tell anyone who I am, and to do what I ask you.â
 47555	
 47556	âYes, your excellency,â replied GerÃ¡sim. âWill you have something to
 47557	eat?â
 47558	
 47559	âNo, but I want something else. I want peasant clothes and a pistol,â
 47560	said Pierre, unexpectedly blushing.
 47561	
 47562	âYes, your excellency,â said GerÃ¡sim after thinking for a moment.
 47563	
 47564	All the rest of that day Pierre spent alone in his benefactorâs study,
 47565	and GerÃ¡sim heard him pacing restlessly from one corner to another and
 47566	talking to himself. And he spent the night on a bed made up for him
 47567	there.
 47568	
 47569	GerÃ¡sim, being a servant who in his time had seen many strange things,
 47570	accepted Pierreâs taking up his residence in the house without surprise,
 47571	and seemed pleased to have someone to wait on. That same eveningâwithout
 47572	even asking himself what they were wanted forâhe procured a coachmanâs
 47573	coat and cap for Pierre, and promised to get him the pistol next day.
 47574	MakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich came twice that evening shuffling along in his galoshes
 47575	as far as the door and stopped and looked ingratiatingly at Pierre. But
 47576	as soon as Pierre turned toward him he wrapped his dressing gown around
 47577	him with a shamefaced and angry look and hurried away. It was when
 47578	Pierre (wearing the coachmanâs coat which GerÃ¡sim had procured for him
 47579	and had disinfected by steam) was on his way with the old man to buy the
 47580	pistol at the SÃºkharev market that he met the RostÃ³vs.

 47586	CHAPTER XIX
 47587	
 47588	KutÃºzovâs order to retreat through Moscow to the RyazÃ¡n road was issued
 47589	at night on the first of September.
 47590	
 47591	The first troops started at once, and during the night they marched
 47592	slowly and steadily without hurry. At daybreak, however, those nearing
 47593	the town at the DorogomÃ­lov bridge saw ahead of them masses of soldiers
 47594	crowding and hurrying across the bridge, ascending on the opposite side
 47595	and blocking the streets and alleys, while endless masses of troops were
 47596	bearing down on them from behind, and an unreasoning hurry and alarm
 47597	overcame them. They all rushed forward to the bridge, onto it, and
 47598	to the fords and the boats. KutÃºzov himself had driven round by side
 47599	streets to the other side of Moscow.
 47600	
 47601	By ten oâclock in the morning of the second of September, only the rear
 47602	guard remained in the DorogomÃ­lov suburb, where they had ample room. The
 47603	main army was on the other side of Moscow or beyond it.
 47604	
 47605	At that very time, at ten in the morning of the second of September,
 47606	Napoleon was standing among his troops on the PoklÃ³nny Hill looking at
 47607	the panorama spread out before him. From the twenty-sixth of August
 47608	to the second of September, that is from the battle of BorodinÃ³ to the
 47609	entry of the French into Moscow, during the whole of that agitating,
 47610	memorable week, there had been the extraordinary autumn weather that
 47611	always comes as a surprise, when the sun hangs low and gives more heat
 47612	than in spring, when everything shines so brightly in the rare clear
 47613	atmosphere that the eyes smart, when the lungs are strengthened and
 47614	refreshed by inhaling the aromatic autumn air, when even the nights
 47615	are warm, and when in those dark warm nights, golden stars startle and
 47616	delight us continually by falling from the sky.
 47617	
 47618	At ten in the morning of the second of September this weather still
 47619	held.
 47620	
 47621	The brightness of the morning was magical. Moscow seen from the PoklÃ³nny
 47622	Hill lay spaciously spread out with her river, her gardens, and her
 47623	churches, and she seemed to be living her usual life, her cupolas
 47624	glittering like stars in the sunlight.
 47625	
 47626	The view of the strange city with its peculiar architecture, such as
 47627	he had never seen before, filled Napoleon with the rather envious and
 47628	uneasy curiosity men feel when they see an alien form of life that has
 47629	no knowledge of them. This city was evidently living with the full force
 47630	of its own life. By the indefinite signs which, even at a distance,
 47631	distinguish a living body from a dead one, Napoleon from the PoklÃ³nny
 47632	Hill perceived the throb of life in the town and felt, as it were, the
 47633	breathing of that great and beautiful body.
 47634	
 47635	Every Russian looking at Moscow feels her to be a mother; every
 47636	foreigner who sees her, even if ignorant of her significance as the
 47637	mother city, must feel her feminine character, and Napoleon felt it.
 47638	
 47639	âCette ville asiatique aux innombrables Ã©glises, Moscou la sainte. La
 47640	voilÃ  donc enfin, cette fameuse ville! Il Ã©tait temps,â * said he, and
 47641	dismounting he ordered a plan of Moscow to be spread out before him, and
 47642	summoned Lelorgne dâIdeville, the interpreter.
 47643	
 47644	     * âThat Asiatic city of the innumerable churches, holy
 47645	     Moscow! Here it is then at last, that famous city. It was
 47646	     high time.â
 47647	
 47648	
 47649	âA town captured by the enemy is like a maid who has lost her honor,â
 47650	thought he (he had said so to TÃºchkov at SmolÃ©nsk). From that point of
 47651	view he gazed at the Oriental beauty he had not seen before. It seemed
 47652	strange to him that his long-felt wish, which had seemed unattainable,
 47653	had at last been realized. In the clear morning light he gazed now at
 47654	the city and now at the plan, considering its details, and the assurance
 47655	of possessing it agitated and awed him.
 47656	
 47657	âBut could it be otherwise?â he thought. âHere is this capital at my
 47658	feet. Where is Alexander now, and of what is he thinking? A strange,
 47659	beautiful, and majestic city; and a strange and majestic moment! In what
 47660	light must I appear to them!â thought he, thinking of his troops.
 47661	âHere she is, the reward for all those fainthearted men,â he reflected,
 47662	glancing at those near him and at the troops who were approaching and
 47663	forming up. âOne word from me, one movement of my hand, and that ancient
 47664	capital of the Tsars would perish. But my clemency is always ready to
 47665	descend upon the vanquished. I must be magnanimous and truly great. But
 47666	no, it canât be true that I am in Moscow,â he suddenly thought.
 47667	âYet here she is lying at my feet, with her golden domes and crosses
 47668	scintillating and twinkling in the sunshine. But I shall spare her. On
 47669	the ancient monuments of barbarism and despotism I will inscribe great
 47670	words of justice and mercy.... It is just this which Alexander will
 47671	feel most painfully, I know him.â (It seemed to Napoleon that the chief
 47672	import of what was taking place lay in the personal struggle between
 47673	himself and Alexander.) âFrom the height of the KrÃ©mlinâyes, there
 47674	is the KrÃ©mlin, yesâI will give them just laws; I will teach them the
 47675	meaning of true civilization, I will make generations of boyars remember
 47676	their conqueror with love. I will tell the deputation that I did not,
 47677	and do not, desire war, that I have waged war only against the false
 47678	policy of their court; that I love and respect Alexander and that in
 47679	Moscow I will accept terms of peace worthy of myself and of my people.
 47680	I do not wish to utilize the fortunes of war to humiliate an honored
 47681	monarch. âBoyars,â I will say to them, âI do not desire war, I desire
 47682	the peace and welfare of all my subjects.â However, I know their
 47683	presence will inspire me, and I shall speak to them as I always do:
 47684	clearly, impressively, and majestically. But can it be true that I am in
 47685	Moscow? Yes, there she lies.â
 47686	
 47687	âQuâon mâamÃ¨ne les boyars,â * said he to his suite.
 47688	
 47689	    * âBring the boyars to me.â
 47690	
 47691	
 47692	A general with a brilliant suite galloped off at once to fetch the
 47693	boyars.
 47694	
 47695	Two hours passed. Napoleon had lunched and was again standing in the
 47696	same place on the PoklÃ³nny Hill awaiting the deputation. His speech to
 47697	the boyars had already taken definite shape in his imagination. That
 47698	speech was full of dignity and greatness as Napoleon understood it.
 47699	
 47700	He was himself carried away by the tone of magnanimity he intended to
 47701	adopt toward Moscow. In his imagination he appointed days for assemblies
 47702	at the palace of the Tsars, at which Russian notables and his own would
 47703	mingle. He mentally appointed a governor, one who would win the
 47704	hearts of the people. Having learned that there were many charitable
 47705	institutions in Moscow he mentally decided that he would shower favors
 47706	on them all. He thought that, as in Africa he had to put on a burnoose
 47707	and sit in a mosque, so in Moscow he must be beneficent like the Tsars.
 47708	And in order finally to touch the hearts of the Russiansâand being like
 47709	all Frenchmen unable to imagine anything sentimental without a reference
 47710	to ma chÃ¨re, ma tendre, ma pauvre mÃ¨re * âhe decided that he would
 47711	place an inscription on all these establishments in large letters:
 47712	âThis establishment is dedicated to my dear mother.â Or no, it should
 47713	be simply: Maison de ma MÃ¨re, *(2) he concluded. âBut am I really in
 47714	Moscow? Yes, here it lies before me, but why is the deputation from the
 47715	city so long in appearing?â he wondered.
 47716	
 47717	     * âMy dear, my tender, my poor mother.â
 47718	
 47719	     * (2) âHouse of my Mother.â
 47720	
 47721	
 47722	Meanwhile an agitated consultation was being carried on in whispers
 47723	among his generals and marshals at the rear of his suite. Those sent to
 47724	fetch the deputation had returned with the news that Moscow was empty,
 47725	that everyone had left it. The faces of those who were not conferring
 47726	together were pale and perturbed. They were not alarmed by the fact
 47727	that Moscow had been abandoned by its inhabitants (grave as that fact
 47728	seemed), but by the question how to tell the Emperorâwithout putting
 47729	him in the terrible position of appearing ridiculousâthat he had been
 47730	awaiting the boyars so long in vain: that there were drunken mobs left
 47731	in Moscow but no one else. Some said that a deputation of some sort must
 47732	be scraped together, others disputed that opinion and maintained that
 47733	the Emperor should first be carefully and skillfully prepared, and then
 47734	told the truth.
 47735	
 47736	âHe will have to be told, all the same,â said some gentlemen of the
 47737	suite. âBut, gentlemen...â
 47738	
 47739	The position was the more awkward because the Emperor, meditating upon
 47740	his magnanimous plans, was pacing patiently up and down before the
 47741	outspread map, occasionally glancing along the road to Moscow from under
 47742	his lifted hand with a bright and proud smile.
 47743	
 47744	âBut itâs impossible...â declared the gentlemen of the suite, shrugging
 47745	their shoulders but not venturing to utter the implied wordâle
 47746	ridicule....
 47747	
 47748	At last the Emperor, tired of futile expectation, his actorâs instinct
 47749	suggesting to him that the sublime moment having been too long drawn out
 47750	was beginning to lose its sublimity, gave a sign with his hand. A single
 47751	report of a signaling gun followed, and the troops, who were already
 47752	spread out on different sides of Moscow, moved into the city through the
 47753	Tver, KalÃºga, and DorogomÃ­lov gates. Faster and faster, vying with
 47754	one another, they moved at the double or at a trot, vanishing amid the
 47755	clouds of dust they raised and making the air ring with a deafening roar
 47756	of mingling shouts.
 47757	
 47758	Drawn on by the movement of his troops Napoleon rode with them as far as
 47759	the DorogomÃ­lov gate, but there again stopped and, dismounting from his
 47760	horse, paced for a long time by the KÃ¡mmer-KollÃ©zski rampart, awaiting
 47761	the deputation.
 47762	
 47763	
 47764	
 47765	
 47766	
 47767	CHAPTER XX
 47768	
 47769	Meanwhile Moscow was empty. There were still people in it, perhaps a
 47770	fiftieth part of its former inhabitants had remained, but it was empty.
 47771	It was empty in the sense that a dying queenless hive is empty.
 47772	
 47773	In a queenless hive no life is left though to a superficial glance it
 47774	seems as much alive as other hives.
 47775	
 47776	The bees circle round a queenless hive in the hot beams of the midday
 47777	sun as gaily as around the living hives; from a distance it smells of
 47778	honey like the others, and bees fly in and out in the same way. But one
 47779	has only to observe that hive to realize that there is no longer any
 47780	life in it. The bees do not fly in the same way, the smell and the sound
 47781	that meet the beekeeper are not the same. To the beekeeperâs tap on the
 47782	wall of the sick hive, instead of the former instant unanimous
 47783	humming of tens of thousands of bees with their abdomens threateningly
 47784	compressed, and producing by the rapid vibration of their wings an
 47785	aerial living sound, the only reply is a disconnected buzzing from
 47786	different parts of the deserted hive. From the alighting board, instead
 47787	of the former spirituous fragrant smell of honey and venom, and the warm
 47788	whiffs of crowded life, comes an odor of emptiness and decay mingling
 47789	with the smell of honey. There are no longer sentinels sounding the
 47790	alarm with their abdomens raised, and ready to die in defense of the
 47791	hive. There is no longer the measured quiet sound of throbbing activity,
 47792	like the sound of boiling water, but diverse discordant sounds of
 47793	disorder. In and out of the hive long black robber bees smeared with
 47794	honey fly timidly and shiftily. They do not sting, but crawl away from
 47795	danger. Formerly only bees laden with honey flew into the hive, and they
 47796	flew out empty; now they fly out laden. The beekeeper opens the lower
 47797	part of the hive and peers in. Instead of black, glossy beesâtamed by
 47798	toil, clinging to one anotherâs legs and drawing out the wax, with a
 47799	ceaseless hum of laborâthat used to hang in long clusters down to the
 47800	floor of the hive, drowsy shriveled bees crawl about separately in
 47801	various directions on the floor and walls of the hive. Instead of a
 47802	neatly glued floor, swept by the bees with the fanning of their wings,
 47803	there is a floor littered with bits of wax, excrement, dying bees
 47804	scarcely moving their legs, and dead ones that have not been cleared
 47805	away.
 47806	
 47807	The beekeeper opens the upper part of the hive and examines the super.
 47808	Instead of serried rows of bees sealing up every gap in the combs and
 47809	keeping the brood warm, he sees the skillful complex structures of the
 47810	combs, but no longer in their former state of purity. All is neglected
 47811	and foul. Black robber bees are swiftly and stealthily prowling about
 47812	the combs, and the short home bees, shriveled and listless as if they
 47813	were old, creep slowly about without trying to hinder the robbers,
 47814	having lost all motive and all sense of life. Drones, bumblebees, wasps,
 47815	and butterflies knock awkwardly against the walls of the hive in their
 47816	flight. Here and there among the cells containing dead brood and honey
 47817	an angry buzzing can sometimes be heard. Here and there a couple of
 47818	bees, by force of habit and custom cleaning out the brood cells, with
 47819	efforts beyond their strength laboriously drag away a dead bee or
 47820	bumblebee without knowing why they do it. In another corner two old bees
 47821	are languidly fighting, or cleaning themselves, or feeding one another,
 47822	without themselves knowing whether they do it with friendly or hostile
 47823	intent. In a third place a crowd of bees, crushing one another, attack
 47824	some victim and fight and smother it, and the victim, enfeebled or
 47825	killed, drops from above slowly and lightly as a feather, among the heap
 47826	of corpses. The keeper opens the two center partitions to examine
 47827	the brood cells. In place of the former close dark circles formed by
 47828	thousands of bees sitting back to back and guarding the high mystery
 47829	of generation, he sees hundreds of dull, listless, and sleepy shells of
 47830	bees. They have almost all died unawares, sitting in the sanctuary they
 47831	had guarded and which is now no more. They reek of decay and death. Only
 47832	a few of them still move, rise, and feebly fly to settle on the enemyâs
 47833	hand, lacking the spirit to die stinging him; the rest are dead and fall
 47834	as lightly as fish scales. The beekeeper closes the hive, chalks a mark
 47835	on it, and when he has time tears out its contents and burns it clean.
 47836	
 47837	So in the same way Moscow was empty when Napoleon, weary, uneasy, and
 47838	morose, paced up and down in front of the KÃ¡mmer-KollÃ©zski rampart,
 47839	awaiting what to his mind was a necessary, if but formal, observance of
 47840	the proprietiesâa deputation.
 47841	
 47842	In various corners of Moscow there still remained a few people aimlessly
 47843	moving about, following their old habits and hardly aware of what they
 47844	were doing.
 47845	
 47846	When with due circumspection Napoleon was informed that Moscow was
 47847	empty, he looked angrily at his informant, turned away, and silently
 47848	continued to walk to and fro.
 47849	
 47850	âMy carriage!â he said.
 47851	
 47852	He took his seat beside the aide-de-camp on duty and drove into the
 47853	suburb. âMoscow deserted!â he said to himself. âWhat an incredible
 47854	event!â
 47855	
 47856	He did not drive into the town, but put up at an inn in the DorogomÃ­lov
 47857	suburb.
 47858	
 47859	The coup de thÃ©Ã¢tre had not come off.
 47860	
 47861	
 47862	
 47863	
 47864	
 47865	CHAPTER XXI
 47866	
 47867	The Russian troops were passing through Moscow from two oâclock at night
 47868	till two in the afternoon and bore away with them the wounded and the
 47869	last of the inhabitants who were leaving.
 47870	
 47871	The greatest crush during the movement of the troops took place at the
 47872	Stone, MoskvÃ¡, and YaÃºza bridges.
 47873	
 47874	While the troops, dividing into two parts when passing around the
 47875	KrÃ©mlin, were thronging the MoskvÃ¡ and the Stone bridges, a great many
 47876	soldiers, taking advantage of the stoppage and congestion, turned back
 47877	from the bridges and slipped stealthily and silently past the church of
 47878	VasÃ­li the Beatified and under the BorovÃ­tski gate, back up the hill
 47879	to the Red Square where some instinct told them they could easily take
 47880	things not belonging to them. Crowds of the kind seen at cheap sales
 47881	filled all the passages and alleys of the Bazaar. But there were no
 47882	dealers with voices of ingratiating affability inviting customers to
 47883	enter; there were no hawkers, nor the usual motley crowd of female
 47884	purchasersâbut only soldiers, in uniforms and overcoats though without
 47885	muskets, entering the Bazaar empty-handed and silently making their way
 47886	out through its passages with bundles. Tradesmen and their assistants
 47887	(of whom there were but few) moved about among the soldiers quite
 47888	bewildered. They unlocked their shops and locked them up again, and
 47889	themselves carried goods away with the help of their assistants. On the
 47890	square in front of the Bazaar were drummers beating the muster call.
 47891	But the roll of the drums did not make the looting soldiers run in the
 47892	direction of the drum as formerly, but made them, on the contrary, run
 47893	farther away. Among the soldiers in the shops and passages some men were
 47894	to be seen in gray coats, with closely shaven heads. Two officers, one
 47895	with a scarf over his uniform and mounted on a lean, dark-gray horse,
 47896	the other in an overcoat and on foot, stood at the corner of IlyÃ­nka
 47897	Street, talking. A third officer galloped up to them.
 47898	
 47899	âThe general orders them all to be driven out at once, without fail.
 47900	This is outrageous! Half the men have dispersed.â
 47901	
 47902	âWhere are you off to?... Where?...â he shouted to three infantrymen
 47903	without muskets who, holding up the skirts of their overcoats, were
 47904	slipping past him into the Bazaar passage. âStop, you rascals!â
 47905	
 47906	âBut how are you going to stop them?â replied another officer. âThere is
 47907	no getting them together. The army should push on before the rest bolt,
 47908	thatâs all!â
 47909	
 47910	âHow can one push on? They are stuck there, wedged on the bridge, and
 47911	donât move. Shouldnât we put a cordon round to prevent the rest from
 47912	running away?â
 47913	
 47914	âCome, go in there and drive them out!â shouted the senior officer.
 47915	
 47916	The officer in the scarf dismounted, called up a drummer, and went with
 47917	him into the arcade. Some soldiers started running away in a group. A
 47918	shopkeeper with red pimples on his cheeks near the nose, and a calm,
 47919	persistent, calculating expression on his plump face, hurriedly and
 47920	ostentatiously approached the officer, swinging his arms.
 47921	
 47922	âYour honor!â said he. âBe so good as to protect us! We wonât grudge
 47923	trifles, you are welcome to anythingâwe shall be delighted! Pray!...
 47924	Iâll fetch a piece of cloth at once for such an honorable gentleman,
 47925	or even two pieces with pleasure. For we feel how it is; but whatâs all
 47926	thisâsheer robbery! If you please, could not guards be placed if only to
 47927	let us close the shop....â
 47928	
 47929	Several shopkeepers crowded round the officer.
 47930	
 47931	âEh, what twaddle!â said one of them, a thin, stern-looking man. âWhen
 47932	oneâs head is gone one doesnât weep for oneâs hair! Take what any of you
 47933	like!â And flourishing his arm energetically he turned sideways to the
 47934	officer.
 47935	
 47936	âItâs all very well for you, IvÃ¡n SidÃ³rych, to talk,â said the first
 47937	tradesman angrily. âPlease step inside, your honor!â
 47938	
 47939	âTalk indeed!â cried the thin one. âIn my three shops here I have a
 47940	hundred thousand rublesâ worth of goods. Can they be saved when the army
 47941	has gone? Eh, what people! âAgainst Godâs might our hands canât fight.ââ
 47942	
 47943	âCome inside, your honor!â repeated the tradesman, bowing.
 47944	
 47945	The officer stood perplexed and his face showed indecision.
 47946	
 47947	âItâs not my business!â he exclaimed, and strode on quickly down one of
 47948	the passages.
 47949	
 47950	From one open shop came the sound of blows and vituperation, and just
 47951	as the officer came up to it a man in a gray coat with a shaven head was
 47952	flung out violently.
 47953	
 47954	This man, bent double, rushed past the tradesman and the officer. The
 47955	officer pounced on the soldiers who were in the shops, but at that
 47956	moment fearful screams reached them from the huge crowd on the MoskvÃ¡
 47957	bridge and the officer ran out into the square.
 47958	
 47959	âWhat is it? What is it?â he asked, but his comrade was already
 47960	galloping off past VasÃ­li the Beatified in the direction from which the
 47961	screams came.
 47962	
 47963	The officer mounted his horse and rode after him. When he reached the
 47964	bridge he saw two unlimbered guns, the infantry crossing the bridge,
 47965	several overturned carts, and frightened and laughing faces among the
 47966	troops. Beside the cannon a cart was standing to which two horses were
 47967	harnessed. Four borzois with collars were pressing close to the wheels.
 47968	The cart was loaded high, and at the very top, beside a childâs chair
 47969	with its legs in the air, sat a peasant woman uttering piercing and
 47970	desperate shrieks. He was told by his fellow officers that the screams
 47971	of the crowd and the shrieks of the woman were due to the fact that
 47972	General ErmÃ³lov, coming up to the crowd and learning that soldiers were
 47973	dispersing among the shops while crowds of civilians blocked the bridge,
 47974	had ordered two guns to be unlimbered and made a show of firing at the
 47975	bridge. The crowd, crushing one another, upsetting carts, and shouting
 47976	and squeezing desperately, had cleared off the bridge and the troops
 47977	were now moving forward.

 47983	CHAPTER XXII
 47984	
 47985	Meanwhile, the city itself was deserted. There was hardly anyone in the
 47986	streets. The gates and shops were all closed, only here and there round
 47987	the taverns solitary shouts or drunken songs could be heard. Nobody
 47988	drove through the streets and footsteps were rarely heard. The
 47989	PovarskÃ¡ya was quite still and deserted. The huge courtyard of the
 47990	RostÃ³vsâ house was littered with wisps of hay and with dung from the
 47991	horses, and not a soul was to be seen there. In the great drawing
 47992	room of the house, which had been left with all it contained, were
 47993	two people. They were the yard porter IgnÃ¡t, and the page boy MÃ­shka,
 47994	VasÃ­lichâs grandson who had stayed in Moscow with his grandfather.
 47995	MÃ­shka had opened the clavichord and was strumming on it with
 47996	one finger. The yard porter, his arms akimbo, stood smiling with
 47997	satisfaction before the large mirror.
 47998	
 47999	âIsnât it fine, eh, Uncle IgnÃ¡t?â said the boy, suddenly beginning to
 48000	strike the keyboard with both hands.
 48001	
 48002	âOnly fancy!â answered IgnÃ¡t, surprised at the broadening grin on his
 48003	face in the mirror.
 48004	
 48005	âImpudence! Impudence!â they heard behind them the voice of MÃ¡vra
 48006	KuzmÃ­nichna who had entered silently. âHow heâs grinning, the fat mug!
 48007	Is that what youâre here for? Nothingâs cleared away down there and
 48008	VasÃ­lich is worn out. Just you wait a bit!â
 48009	
 48010	IgnÃ¡t left off smiling, adjusted his belt, and went out of the room with
 48011	meekly downcast eyes.
 48012	
 48013	âAunt, I did it gently,â said the boy.
 48014	
 48015	âIâll give you something gently, you monkey you!â cried MÃ¡vra
 48016	KuzmÃ­nichna, raising her arm threateningly. âGo and get the samovar to
 48017	boil for your grandfather.â
 48018	
 48019	MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna flicked the dust off the clavichord and closed it, and
 48020	with a deep sigh left the drawing room and locked its main door.
 48021	
 48022	Going out into the yard she paused to consider where she should go
 48023	nextâto drink tea in the servantsâ wing with VasÃ­lich, or into the
 48024	storeroom to put away what still lay about.
 48025	
 48026	She heard the sound of quick footsteps in the quiet street. Someone
 48027	stopped at the gate, and the latch rattled as someone tried to open it.
 48028	MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna went to the gate.
 48029	
 48030	âWho do you want?â
 48031	
 48032	âThe countâCount IlyÃ¡ AndrÃ©evich RostÃ³v.â
 48033	
 48034	âAnd who are you?â
 48035	
 48036	âAn officer, I have to see him,â came the reply in a pleasant, well-bred
 48037	Russian voice.
 48038	
 48039	MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna opened the gate and an officer of eighteen, with the
 48040	round face of a RostÃ³v, entered the yard.
 48041	
 48042	âThey have gone away, sir. Went away yesterday at vespertime,â said
 48043	MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna cordially.
 48044	
 48045	The young officer standing in the gateway, as if hesitating whether to
 48046	enter or not, clicked his tongue.
 48047	
 48048	âAh, how annoying!â he muttered. âI should have come yesterday.... Ah,
 48049	what a pity.â
 48050	
 48051	Meanwhile, MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna was attentively and sympathetically
 48052	examining the familiar RostÃ³v features of the young manâs face, his
 48053	tattered coat and trodden-down boots.
 48054	
 48055	âWhat did you want to see the count for?â she asked.
 48056	
 48057	âOh well... it canât be helped!â said he in a tone of vexation and
 48058	placed his hand on the gate as if to leave.
 48059	
 48060	He again paused in indecision.
 48061	
 48062	âYou see,â he suddenly said, âI am a kinsman of the countâs and he has
 48063	been very kind to me. As you seeâ (he glanced with an amused air and
 48064	good-natured smile at his coat and boots) âmy things are worn out and I
 48065	have no money, so I was going to ask the count...â
 48066	
 48067	MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna did not let him finish.
 48068	
 48069	âJust wait a minute, sir. One little moment,â said she.
 48070	
 48071	And as soon as the officer let go of the gate handle she turned and,
 48072	hurrying away on her old legs, went through the back yard to the
 48073	servantsâ quarters.
 48074	
 48075	While MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna was running to her room the officer walked about
 48076	the yard gazing at his worn-out boots with lowered head and a faint
 48077	smile on his lips. âWhat a pity Iâve missed Uncle! What a nice old
 48078	woman! Where has she run off to? And how am I to find the nearest way
 48079	to overtake my regiment, which must by now be getting near the RogÃ³zhski
 48080	gate?â thought he. Just then MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna appeared from behind
 48081	the corner of the house with a frightened yet resolute look, carrying a
 48082	rolled-up check kerchief in her hand. While still a few steps from
 48083	the officer she unfolded the kerchief and took out of it a white
 48084	twenty-five-ruble assignat and hastily handed it to him.
 48085	
 48086	âIf his excellency had been at home, as a kinsman he would of course...
 48087	but as it is...â
 48088	
 48089	MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna grew abashed and confused. The officer did not
 48090	decline, but took the note quietly and thanked her.
 48091	
 48092	âIf the count had been at home...â MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna went on
 48093	apologetically. âChrist be with you, sir! May God preserve you!â said
 48094	she, bowing as she saw him out.
 48095	
 48096	Swaying his head and smiling as if amused at himself, the officer ran
 48097	almost at a trot through the deserted streets toward the YaÃºza bridge to
 48098	overtake his regiment.
 48099	
 48100	But MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna stood at the closed gate for some time with moist
 48101	eyes, pensively swaying her head and feeling an unexpected flow of
 48102	motherly tenderness and pity for the unknown young officer.
 48103	
 48104	
 48105	
 48106	
 48107	
 48108	CHAPTER XXIII
 48109	
 48110	From an unfinished house on the VarvÃ¡rka, the ground floor of which was
 48111	a dramshop, came drunken shouts and songs. On benches round the tables
 48112	in a dirty little room sat some ten factory hands. Tipsy and perspiring,
 48113	with dim eyes and wide-open mouths, they were all laboriously singing
 48114	some song or other. They were singing discordantly, arduously, and with
 48115	great effort, evidently not because they wished to sing, but because
 48116	they wanted to show they were drunk and on a spree. One, a tall,
 48117	fair-haired lad in a clean blue coat, was standing over the others. His
 48118	face with its fine straight nose would have been handsome had it not
 48119	been for his thin, compressed, twitching lips and dull, gloomy, fixed
 48120	eyes. Evidently possessed by some idea, he stood over those who were
 48121	singing, and solemnly and jerkily flourished above their heads his white
 48122	arm with the sleeve turned up to the elbow, trying unnaturally to spread
 48123	out his dirty fingers. The sleeve of his coat kept slipping down and he
 48124	always carefully rolled it up again with his left hand, as if it were
 48125	most important that the sinewy white arm he was flourishing should be
 48126	bare. In the midst of the song cries were heard, and fighting and blows
 48127	in the passage and porch. The tall lad waved his arm.
 48128	
 48129	âStop it!â he exclaimed peremptorily. âThereâs a fight, lads!â And,
 48130	still rolling up his sleeve, he went out to the porch.
 48131	
 48132	The factory hands followed him. These men, who under the leadership of
 48133	the tall lad were drinking in the dramshop that morning, had brought the
 48134	publican some skins from the factory and for this had had drink served
 48135	them. The blacksmiths from a neighboring smithy, hearing the sounds of
 48136	revelry in the tavern and supposing it to have been broken into, wished
 48137	to force their way in too and a fight in the porch had resulted.
 48138	
 48139	The publican was fighting one of the smiths at the door, and when the
 48140	workmen came out the smith, wrenching himself free from the tavern
 48141	keeper, fell face downward on the pavement.
 48142	
 48143	Another smith tried to enter the doorway, pressing against the publican
 48144	with his chest.
 48145	
 48146	The lad with the turned-up sleeve gave the smith a blow in the face and
 48147	cried wildly: âTheyâre fighting us, lads!â
 48148	
 48149	At that moment the first smith got up and, scratching his bruised
 48150	face to make it bleed, shouted in a tearful voice: âPolice! Murder!...
 48151	Theyâve killed a man, lads!â
 48152	
 48153	âOh, gracious me, a man beaten to deathâkilled!...â screamed a woman
 48154	coming out of a gate close by.
 48155	
 48156	A crowd gathered round the bloodstained smith.
 48157	
 48158	âHavenât you robbed people enoughâtaking their last shirts?â said a
 48159	voice addressing the publican. âWhat have you killed a man for, you
 48160	thief?â
 48161	
 48162	The tall lad, standing in the porch, turned his bleared eyes from the
 48163	publican to the smith and back again as if considering whom he ought to
 48164	fight now.
 48165	
 48166	âMurderer!â he shouted suddenly to the publican. âBind him, lads!â
 48167	
 48168	âI daresay you would like to bind me!â shouted the publican, pushing
 48169	away the men advancing on him, and snatching his cap from his head he
 48170	flung it on the ground.
 48171	
 48172	As if this action had some mysterious and menacing significance, the
 48173	workmen surrounding the publican paused in indecision.
 48174	
 48175	âI know the law very well, mates! Iâll take the matter to the captain
 48176	of police. You think I wonât get to him? Robbery is not permitted to
 48177	anybody nowadays!â shouted the publican, picking up his cap.
 48178	
 48179	âCome along then! Come along then!â the publican and the tall young
 48180	fellow repeated one after the other, and they moved up the street
 48181	together.
 48182	
 48183	The bloodstained smith went beside them. The factory hands and others
 48184	followed behind, talking and shouting.
 48185	
 48186	At the corner of the MorosÃ©yka, opposite a large house with closed
 48187	shutters and bearing a bootmakerâs signboard, stood a score of thin,
 48188	worn-out, gloomy-faced bootmakers, wearing overalls and long tattered
 48189	coats.
 48190	
 48191	âHe should pay folks off properly,â a thin workingman, with frowning
 48192	brows and a straggly beard, was saying.
 48193	
 48194	âBut heâs sucked our blood and now he thinks heâs quit of us. Heâs been
 48195	misleading us all the week and now that heâs brought us to this pass
 48196	heâs made off.â
 48197	
 48198	On seeing the crowd and the bloodstained man the workman ceased
 48199	speaking, and with eager curiosity all the bootmakers joined the moving
 48200	crowd.
 48201	
 48202	âWhere are all the folks going?â
 48203	
 48204	âWhy, to the police, of course!â
 48205	
 48206	âI say, is it true that we have been beaten?â âAnd what did you think?
 48207	Look what folks are saying.â
 48208	
 48209	Questions and answers were heard. The publican, taking advantage of the
 48210	increased crowd, dropped behind and returned to his tavern.
 48211	
 48212	The tall youth, not noticing the disappearance of his foe, waved his
 48213	bare arm and went on talking incessantly, attracting general attention
 48214	to himself. It was around him that the people chiefly crowded, expecting
 48215	answers from him to the questions that occupied all their minds.
 48216	
 48217	âHe must keep order, keep the law, thatâs what the government is there
 48218	for. Am I not right, good Christians?â said the tall youth, with a
 48219	scarcely perceptible smile. âHe thinks thereâs no government! How can
 48220	one do without government? Or else there would be plenty whoâd rob us.â
 48221	
 48222	âWhy talk nonsense?â rejoined voices in the crowd. âWill they give
 48223	up Moscow like this? They told you that for fun, and you believed it!
 48224	Arenât there plenty of troops on the march? Let him in, indeed! Thatâs
 48225	what the government is for. Youâd better listen to what people are
 48226	saying,â said some of the mob pointing to the tall youth.
 48227	
 48228	By the wall of China-Town a smaller group of people were gathered round
 48229	a man in a frieze coat who held a paper in his hand.
 48230	
 48231	âAn ukÃ¡se, they are reading an ukÃ¡se! Reading an ukÃ¡se!â cried voices in
 48232	the crowd, and the people rushed toward the reader.
 48233	
 48234	The man in the frieze coat was reading the broadsheet of August 31. When
 48235	the crowd collected round him he seemed confused, but at the demand
 48236	of the tall lad who had pushed his way up to him, he began in a rather
 48237	tremulous voice to read the sheet from the beginning.
 48238	
 48239	âEarly tomorrow I shall go to his Serene Highness,â he read (âSirin
 48240	Highness,â said the tall fellow with a triumphant smile on his lips and
 48241	a frown on his brow), âto consult with him to act, and to aid the army
 48242	to exterminate these scoundrels. We too will take part...â the reader
 48243	went on, and then paused (âDo you see,â shouted the youth victoriously,
 48244	âheâs going to clear up the whole affair for you....â), âin destroying
 48245	them, and will send these visitors to the devil. I will come back to
 48246	dinner, and weâll set to work. We will do, completely do, and undo these
 48247	scoundrels.â
 48248	
 48249	The last words were read out in the midst of complete silence. The tall
 48250	lad hung his head gloomily. It was evident that no one had understood
 48251	the last part. In particular, the words âI will come back to dinner,â
 48252	evidently displeased both reader and audience. The peopleâs minds
 48253	were tuned to a high pitch and this was too simple and needlessly
 48254	comprehensibleâit was what any one of them might have said and therefore
 48255	was what an ukÃ¡se emanating from the highest authority should not say.
 48256	
 48257	They all stood despondent and silent. The tall youth moved his lips and
 48258	swayed from side to side.
 48259	
 48260	âWe should ask him... thatâs he himself?â... âYes, ask him indeed!...
 48261	Why not? Heâll explainâ... voices in the rear of the crowd were
 48262	suddenly heard saying, and the general attention turned to the police
 48263	superintendentâs trap which drove into the square attended by two
 48264	mounted dragoons.
 48265	
 48266	The superintendent of police, who had gone that morning by Count
 48267	RostopchÃ­nâs orders to burn the barges and had in connection with that
 48268	matter acquired a large sum of money which was at that moment in his
 48269	pocket, on seeing a crowd bearing down upon him told his coachman to
 48270	stop.
 48271	
 48272	âWhat people are these?â he shouted to the men, who were moving singly
 48273	and timidly in the direction of his trap.
 48274	
 48275	âWhat people are these?â he shouted again, receiving no answer.
 48276	
 48277	âYour honor...â replied the shopman in the frieze coat, âyour honor, in
 48278	accord with the proclamation of his highest excellency the count, they
 48279	desire to serve, not sparing their lives, and it is not any kind of
 48280	riot, but as his highest excellence said...â
 48281	
 48282	âThe count has not left, he is here, and an order will be issued
 48283	concerning you,â said the superintendent of police. âGo on!â he ordered
 48284	his coachman.
 48285	
 48286	The crowd halted, pressing around those who had heard what the
 48287	superintendent had said, and looking at the departing trap.
 48288	
 48289	The superintendent of police turned round at that moment with a scared
 48290	look, said something to his coachman, and his horses increased their
 48291	speed.
 48292	
 48293	âItâs a fraud, lads! Lead the way to him, himself!â shouted the tall
 48294	youth. âDonât let him go, lads! Let him answer us! Keep him!â shouted
 48295	different people and the people dashed in pursuit of the trap.
 48296	
 48297	Following the superintendent of police and talking loudly the crowd went
 48298	in the direction of the LubyÃ¡nka Street.
 48299	
 48300	âThere now, the gentry and merchants have gone away and left us to
 48301	perish. Do they think weâre dogs?â voices in the crowd were heard saying
 48302	more and more frequently.
 48303	
 48304	
 48305	
 48306	
 48307	
 48308	CHAPTER XXIV
 48309	
 48310	On the evening of the first of September, after his interview with
 48311	KutÃºzov, Count RostopchÃ­n had returned to Moscow mortified and offended
 48312	because he had not been invited to attend the council of war, and
 48313	because KutÃºzov had paid no attention to his offer to take part in the
 48314	defense of the city; amazed also at the novel outlook revealed to him
 48315	at the camp, which treated the tranquillity of the capital and its
 48316	patriotic fervor as not merely secondary but quite irrelevant and
 48317	unimportant matters. Distressed, offended, and surprised by all this,
 48318	RostopchÃ­n had returned to Moscow. After supper he lay down on a sofa
 48319	without undressing, and was awakened soon after midnight by a courier
 48320	bringing him a letter from KutÃºzov. This letter requested the count to
 48321	send police officers to guide the troops through the town, as the army
 48322	was retreating to the RyazÃ¡n road beyond Moscow. This was not news to
 48323	RostopchÃ­n. He had known that Moscow would be abandoned not merely since
 48324	his interview the previous day with KutÃºzov on the PoklÃ³nny Hill but
 48325	ever since the battle of BorodinÃ³, for all the generals who came to
 48326	Moscow after that battle had said unanimously that it was impossible to
 48327	fight another battle, and since then the government property had been
 48328	removed every night, and half the inhabitants had left the city
 48329	with RostopchÃ­nâs own permission. Yet all the same this information
 48330	astonished and irritated the count, coming as it did in the form of a
 48331	simple note with an order from KutÃºzov, and received at night, breaking
 48332	in on his beauty sleep.
 48333	
 48334	When later on in his memoirs Count RostopchÃ­n explained his actions at
 48335	this time, he repeatedly says that he was then actuated by two important
 48336	considerations: to maintain tranquillity in Moscow and expedite the
 48337	departure of the inhabitants. If one accepts this twofold aim all
 48338	RostopchÃ­nâs actions appear irreproachable. âWhy were the holy relics,
 48339	the arms, ammunition, gunpowder, and stores of corn not removed? Why
 48340	were thousands of inhabitants deceived into believing that Moscow would
 48341	not be given upâand thereby ruined?â âTo preserve the tranquillity
 48342	of the city,â explains Count RostopchÃ­n. âWhy were bundles of useless
 48343	papers from the government offices, and Leppichâs balloon and other
 48344	articles removed?â âTo leave the town empty,â explains Count RostopchÃ­n.
 48345	One need only admit that public tranquillity is in danger and any action
 48346	finds a justification.
 48347	
 48348	All the horrors of the reign of terror were based only on solicitude for
 48349	public tranquillity.
 48350	
 48351	On what, then, was Count RostopchÃ­nâs fear for the tranquillity of
 48352	Moscow based in 1812? What reason was there for assuming any probability
 48353	of an uprising in the city? The inhabitants were leaving it and the
 48354	retreating troops were filling it. Why should that cause the masses to
 48355	riot?
 48356	
 48357	Neither in Moscow nor anywhere in Russia did anything resembling an
 48358	insurrection ever occur when the enemy entered a town. More than
 48359	ten thousand people were still in Moscow on the first and second of
 48360	September, and except for a mob in the governorâs courtyard, assembled
 48361	there at his bidding, nothing happened. It is obvious that there would
 48362	have been even less reason to expect a disturbance among the people
 48363	if after the battle of BorodinÃ³, when the surrender of Moscow became
 48364	certain or at least probable, RostopchÃ­n instead of exciting the people
 48365	by distributing arms and broadsheets had taken steps to remove all
 48366	the holy relics, the gunpowder, munitions, and money, and had told the
 48367	population plainly that the town would be abandoned.
 48368	
 48369	RostopchÃ­n, though he had patriotic sentiments, was a sanguine and
 48370	impulsive man who had always moved in the highest administrative circles
 48371	and had no understanding at all of the people he supposed himself to
 48372	be guiding. Ever since the enemyâs entry into SmolÃ©nsk he had in
 48373	imagination been playing the role of director of the popular feeling
 48374	of âthe heart of Russia.â Not only did it seem to him (as to all
 48375	administrators) that he controlled the external actions of Moscowâs
 48376	inhabitants, but he also thought he controlled their mental attitude by
 48377	means of his broadsheets and posters, written in a coarse tone which the
 48378	people despise in their own class and do not understand from those in
 48379	authority. RostopchÃ­n was so pleased with the fine role of leader of
 48380	popular feeling, and had grown so used to it, that the necessity of
 48381	relinquishing that role and abandoning Moscow without any heroic display
 48382	took him unawares and he suddenly felt the ground slip away from under
 48383	his feet, so that he positively did not know what to do. Though he knew
 48384	it was coming, he did not till the last moment wholeheartedly believe
 48385	that Moscow would be abandoned, and did not prepare for it. The
 48386	inhabitants left against his wishes. If the government offices were
 48387	removed, this was only done on the demand of officials to whom the count
 48388	yielded reluctantly. He was absorbed in the role he had created
 48389	for himself. As is often the case with those gifted with an ardent
 48390	imagination, though he had long known that Moscow would be abandoned he
 48391	knew it only with his intellect, he did not believe it in his heart and
 48392	did not adapt himself mentally to this new position of affairs.
 48393	
 48394	All his painstaking and energetic activity (in how far it was useful
 48395	and had any effect on the people is another question) had been simply
 48396	directed toward arousing in the masses his own feeling of patriotic
 48397	hatred of the French.
 48398	
 48399	But when events assumed their true historical character, when expressing
 48400	hatred for the French in words proved insufficient, when it was not
 48401	even possible to express that hatred by fighting a battle, when
 48402	self-confidence was of no avail in relation to the one question before
 48403	Moscow, when the whole population streamed out of Moscow as one man,
 48404	abandoning their belongings and proving by that negative action all
 48405	the depth of their national feeling, then the role chosen by RostopchÃ­n
 48406	suddenly appeared senseless. He unexpectedly felt himself ridiculous,
 48407	weak, and alone, with no ground to stand on.
 48408	
 48409	When, awakened from his sleep, he received that cold, peremptory note
 48410	from KutÃºzov, he felt the more irritated the more he felt himself
 48411	to blame. All that he had been specially put in charge of, the state
 48412	property which he should have removed, was still in Moscow and it was no
 48413	longer possible to take the whole of it away.
 48414	
 48415	âWho is to blame for it? Who has let things come to such a pass?â he
 48416	ruminated. âNot I, of course. I had everything ready. I had Moscow
 48417	firmly in hand. And this is what they have let it come to! Villains!
 48418	Traitors!â he thought, without clearly defining who the villains and
 48419	traitors were, but feeling it necessary to hate those traitors whoever
 48420	they might be who were to blame for the false and ridiculous position in
 48421	which he found himself.
 48422	
 48423	All that night Count RostopchÃ­n issued orders, for which people came to
 48424	him from all parts of Moscow. Those about him had never seen the count
 48425	so morose and irritable.
 48426	
 48427	âYour excellency, the Director of the Registrarâs Department has sent
 48428	for instructions.... From the Consistory, from the Senate, from the
 48429	University, from the Foundling Hospital, the Suffragan has sent...
 48430	asking for information.... What are your orders about the Fire Brigade?
 48431	From the governor of the prison... from the superintendent of the
 48432	lunatic asylum...â All night long such announcements were continually
 48433	being received by the count.
 48434	
 48435	To all these inquiries he gave brief and angry replies indicating that
 48436	orders from him were not now needed, that the whole affair, carefully
 48437	prepared by him, had now been ruined by somebody, and that that somebody
 48438	would have to bear the whole responsibility for all that might happen.
 48439	
 48440	âOh, tell that blockhead,â he said in reply to the question from the
 48441	Registrarâs Department, âthat he should remain to guard his documents.
 48442	Now why are you asking silly questions about the Fire Brigade? They have
 48443	horses, let them be off to VladÃ­mir, and not leave them to the French.â
 48444	
 48445	âYour excellency, the superintendent of the lunatic asylum has come:
 48446	what are your commands?â
 48447	
 48448	âMy commands? Let them go away, thatâs all.... And let the lunatics
 48449	out into the town. When lunatics command our armies God evidently means
 48450	these other madmen to be free.â
 48451	
 48452	In reply to an inquiry about the convicts in the prison, Count
 48453	RostopchÃ­n shouted angrily at the governor:
 48454	
 48455	âDo you expect me to give you two battalionsâwhich we have not gotâfor a
 48456	convoy? Release them, thatâs all about it!â
 48457	
 48458	âYour excellency, there are some political prisoners, MeshkÃ³v,
 48459	VereshchÃ¡gin...â
 48460	
 48461	âVereshchÃ¡gin! Hasnât he been hanged yet?â shouted RostopchÃ­n. âBring
 48462	him to me!â
 48463	
 48464	
 48465	
 48466	
 48467	
 48468	CHAPTER XXV
 48469	
 48470	Toward nine oâclock in the morning, when the troops were already moving
 48471	through Moscow, nobody came to the count any more for instructions.
 48472	Those who were able to get away were going of their own accord, those
 48473	who remained behind decided for themselves what they must do.
 48474	
 48475	The count ordered his carriage that he might drive to SokÃ³lniki, and sat
 48476	in his study with folded hands, morose, sallow, and taciturn.
 48477	
 48478	In quiet and untroubled times it seems to every administrator that it
 48479	is only by his efforts that the whole population under his rule is
 48480	kept going, and in this consciousness of being indispensable every
 48481	administrator finds the chief reward of his labor and efforts. While the
 48482	sea of history remains calm the ruler-administrator in his frail bark,
 48483	holding on with a boat hook to the ship of the people and himself
 48484	moving, naturally imagines that his efforts move the ship he is holding
 48485	on to. But as soon as a storm arises and the sea begins to heave and
 48486	the ship to move, such a delusion is no longer possible. The ship moves
 48487	independently with its own enormous motion, the boat hook no longer
 48488	reaches the moving vessel, and suddenly the administrator, instead
 48489	of appearing a ruler and a source of power, becomes an insignificant,
 48490	useless, feeble man.
 48491	
 48492	RostopchÃ­n felt this, and it was this which exasperated him.
 48493	
 48494	The superintendent of police, whom the crowd had stopped, went in to
 48495	see him at the same time as an adjutant who informed the count that the
 48496	horses were harnessed. They were both pale, and the superintendent of
 48497	police, after reporting that he had executed the instructions he had
 48498	received, informed the count that an immense crowd had collected in the
 48499	courtyard and wished to see him.
 48500	
 48501	Without saying a word RostopchÃ­n rose and walked hastily to his light,
 48502	luxurious drawing room, went to the balcony door, took hold of the
 48503	handle, let it go again, and went to the window from which he had a
 48504	better view of the whole crowd. The tall lad was standing in front,
 48505	flourishing his arm and saying something with a stern look. The
 48506	blood-stained smith stood beside him with a gloomy face. A drone of
 48507	voices was audible through the closed window.
 48508	
 48509	âIs my carriage ready?â asked RostopchÃ­n, stepping back from the window.
 48510	
 48511	âIt is, your excellency,â replied the adjutant.
 48512	
 48513	RostopchÃ­n went again to the balcony door.
 48514	
 48515	âBut what do they want?â he asked the superintendent of police.
 48516	
 48517	âYour excellency, they say they have got ready, according to your
 48518	orders, to go against the French, and they shouted something about
 48519	treachery. But it is a turbulent crowd, your excellencyâI hardly managed
 48520	to get away from it. Your excellency, I venture to suggest...â
 48521	
 48522	âYou may go. I donât need you to tell me what to do!â exclaimed
 48523	RostopchÃ­n angrily.
 48524	
 48525	He stood by the balcony door looking at the crowd.
 48526	
 48527	âThis is what they have done with Russia! This is what they have done
 48528	with me!â thought he, full of an irrepressible fury that welled up
 48529	within him against the someone to whom what was happening might be
 48530	attributed. As often happens with passionate people, he was mastered by
 48531	anger but was still seeking an object on which to vent it. âHere is
 48532	that mob, the dregs of the people,â he thought as he gazed at the crowd:
 48533	âthis rabble they have roused by their folly! They want a victim,â
 48534	he thought as he looked at the tall lad flourishing his arm. And this
 48535	thought occurred to him just because he himself desired a victim,
 48536	something on which to vent his rage.
 48537	
 48538	âIs the carriage ready?â he asked again.
 48539	
 48540	âYes, your excellency. What are your orders about VereshchÃ¡gin? He is
 48541	waiting at the porch,â said the adjutant.
 48542	
 48543	âAh!â exclaimed RostopchÃ­n, as if struck by an unexpected recollection.
 48544	
 48545	And rapidly opening the door he went resolutely out onto the balcony.
 48546	The talking instantly ceased, hats and caps were doffed, and all eyes
 48547	were raised to the count.
 48548	
 48549	âGood morning, lads!â said the count briskly and loudly. âThank you for
 48550	coming. Iâll come out to you in a moment, but we must first settle
 48551	with the villain. We must punish the villain who has caused the ruin of
 48552	Moscow. Wait for me!â
 48553	
 48554	And the count stepped as briskly back into the room and slammed the door
 48555	behind him.
 48556	
 48557	A murmur of approbation and satisfaction ran through the crowd. âHeâll
 48558	settle with all the villains, youâll see! And you said the French...
 48559	Heâll show you what law is!â the mob were saying as if reproving one
 48560	another for their lack of confidence.
 48561	
 48562	A few minutes later an officer came hurriedly out of the front door,
 48563	gave an order, and the dragoons formed up in line. The crowd moved
 48564	eagerly from the balcony toward the porch. RostopchÃ­n, coming out there
 48565	with quick angry steps, looked hastily around as if seeking someone.
 48566	
 48567	âWhere is he?â he inquired. And as he spoke he saw a young man coming
 48568	round the corner of the house between two dragoons. He had a long thin
 48569	neck, and his head, that had been half shaved, was again covered by
 48570	short hair. This young man was dressed in a threadbare blue cloth coat
 48571	lined with fox fur, that had once been smart, and dirty hempen convict
 48572	trousers, over which were pulled his thin, dirty, trodden-down boots.
 48573	On his thin, weak legs were heavy chains which hampered his irresolute
 48574	movements.
 48575	
 48576	âAh!â said RostopchÃ­n, hurriedly turning away his eyes from the young
 48577	man in the fur-lined coat and pointing to the bottom step of the porch.
 48578	âPut him there.â
 48579	
 48580	The young man in his clattering chains stepped clumsily to the spot
 48581	indicated, holding away with one finger the coat collar which chafed
 48582	his neck, turned his long neck twice this way and that, sighed, and
 48583	submissively folded before him his thin hands, unused to work.
 48584	
 48585	For several seconds while the young man was taking his place on the step
 48586	the silence continued. Only among the back rows of the people, who were
 48587	all pressing toward the one spot, could sighs, groans, and the shuffling
 48588	of feet be heard.
 48589	
 48590	While waiting for the young man to take his place on the step RostopchÃ­n
 48591	stood frowning and rubbing his face with his hand.
 48592	
 48593	âLads!â said he, with a metallic ring in his voice. âThis man,
 48594	VereshchÃ¡gin, is the scoundrel by whose doing Moscow is perishing.â
 48595	
 48596	The young man in the fur-lined coat, stooping a little, stood in a
 48597	submissive attitude, his fingers clasped before him. His emaciated young
 48598	face, disfigured by the half-shaven head, hung down hopelessly. At
 48599	the countâs first words he raised it slowly and looked up at him as if
 48600	wishing to say something or at least to meet his eye. But RostopchÃ­n did
 48601	not look at him. A vein in the young manâs long thin neck swelled like a
 48602	cord and went blue behind the ear, and suddenly his face flushed.
 48603	
 48604	All eyes were fixed on him. He looked at the crowd, and rendered more
 48605	hopeful by the expression he read on the faces there, he smiled sadly
 48606	and timidly, and lowering his head shifted his feet on the step.
 48607	
 48608	âHe has betrayed his Tsar and his country, he has gone over to
 48609	Bonaparte. He alone of all the Russians has disgraced the Russian name,
 48610	he has caused Moscow to perish,â said RostopchÃ­n in a sharp, even voice,
 48611	but suddenly he glanced down at VereshchÃ¡gin who continued to stand in
 48612	the same submissive attitude. As if inflamed by the sight, he raised his
 48613	arm and addressed the people, almost shouting:
 48614	
 48615	âDeal with him as you think fit! I hand him over to you.â
 48616	
 48617	The crowd remained silent and only pressed closer and closer to
 48618	one another. To keep one another back, to breathe in that stifling
 48619	atmosphere, to be unable to stir, and to await something unknown,
 48620	uncomprehended, and terrible, was becoming unbearable. Those standing
 48621	in front, who had seen and heard what had taken place before them, all
 48622	stood with wide-open eyes and mouths, straining with all their strength,
 48623	and held back the crowd that was pushing behind them.
 48624	
 48625	âBeat him!... Let the traitor perish and not disgrace the Russian name!â
 48626	shouted RostopchÃ­n. âCut him down. I command it.â
 48627	
 48628	Hearing not so much the words as the angry tone of RostopchÃ­nâs voice,
 48629	the crowd moaned and heaved forward, but again paused.
 48630	
 48631	âCount!â exclaimed the timid yet theatrical voice of VereshchÃ¡gin in the
 48632	midst of the momentary silence that ensued, âCount! One God is above us
 48633	both....â He lifted his head and again the thick vein in his thin neck
 48634	filled with blood and the color rapidly came and went in his face.
 48635	
 48636	He did not finish what he wished to say.
 48637	
 48638	âCut him down! I command it...â shouted RostopchÃ­n, suddenly growing
 48639	pale like VereshchÃ¡gin.
 48640	
 48641	âDraw sabers!â cried the dragoon officer, drawing his own.
 48642	
 48643	Another still stronger wave flowed through the crowd and reaching the
 48644	front ranks carried it swaying to the very steps of the porch. The tall
 48645	youth, with a stony look on his face, and rigid and uplifted arm, stood
 48646	beside VereshchÃ¡gin.
 48647	
 48648	âSaber him!â the dragoon officer almost whispered.
 48649	
 48650	And one of the soldiers, his face all at once distorted with fury,
 48651	struck VereshchÃ¡gin on the head with the blunt side of his saber.
 48652	
 48653	âAh!â cried VereshchÃ¡gin in meek surprise, looking round with a
 48654	frightened glance as if not understanding why this was done to him. A
 48655	similar moan of surprise and horror ran through the crowd. âO Lord!â
 48656	exclaimed a sorrowful voice.
 48657	
 48658	But after the exclamation of surprise that had escaped from VereshchÃ¡gin
 48659	he uttered a plaintive cry of pain, and that cry was fatal. The barrier
 48660	of human feeling, strained to the utmost, that had held the crowd in
 48661	check suddenly broke. The crime had begun and must now be completed. The
 48662	plaintive moan of reproach was drowned by the threatening and angry roar
 48663	of the crowd. Like the seventh and last wave that shatters a ship, that
 48664	last irresistible wave burst from the rear and reached the front ranks,
 48665	carrying them off their feet and engulfing them all. The dragoon was
 48666	about to repeat his blow. VereshchÃ¡gin with a cry of horror, covering
 48667	his head with his hands, rushed toward the crowd. The tall youth,
 48668	against whom he stumbled, seized his thin neck with his hands and,
 48669	yelling wildly, fell with him under the feet of the pressing, struggling
 48670	crowd.
 48671	
 48672	Some beat and tore at VereshchÃ¡gin, others at the tall youth. And the
 48673	screams of those that were being trampled on and of those who tried to
 48674	rescue the tall lad only increased the fury of the crowd. It was a long
 48675	time before the dragoons could extricate the bleeding youth, beaten
 48676	almost to death. And for a long time, despite the feverish haste with
 48677	which the mob tried to end the work that had been begun, those who were
 48678	hitting, throttling, and tearing at VereshchÃ¡gin were unable to kill
 48679	him, for the crowd pressed from all sides, swaying as one mass with them
 48680	in the center and rendering it impossible for them either to kill him or
 48681	let him go.
 48682	
 48683	âHit him with an ax, eh!... Crushed?... Traitor, he sold Christ....
 48684	Still alive... tenacious... serves him right! Torture serves a thief
 48685	right. Use the hatchet!... Whatâstill alive?â
 48686	
 48687	Only when the victim ceased to struggle and his cries changed to a
 48688	long-drawn, measured death rattle did the crowd around his prostrate,
 48689	bleeding corpse begin rapidly to change places. Each one came
 48690	up, glanced at what had been done, and with horror, reproach, and
 48691	astonishment pushed back again.
 48692	
 48693	âO Lord! The people are like wild beasts! How could he be alive?â voices
 48694	in the crowd could be heard saying. âQuite a young fellow too... must
 48695	have been a merchantâs son. What men!... and they say heâs not the right
 48696	one.... How not the right one?... O Lord! And thereâs another has been
 48697	beaten tooâthey say heâs nearly done for.... Oh, the people... Arenât
 48698	they afraid of sinning?...â said the same mob now, looking with pained
 48699	distress at the dead body with its long, thin, half-severed neck and its
 48700	livid face stained with blood and dust.
 48701	
 48702	A painstaking police officer, considering the presence of a corpse in
 48703	his excellencyâs courtyard unseemly, told the dragoons to take it away.
 48704	Two dragoons took it by its distorted legs and dragged it along the
 48705	ground. The gory, dust-stained, half-shaven head with its long neck
 48706	trailed twisting along the ground. The crowd shrank back from it.
 48707	
 48708	At the moment when VereshchÃ¡gin fell and the crowd closed in with savage
 48709	yells and swayed about him, RostopchÃ­n suddenly turned pale and, instead
 48710	of going to the back entrance where his carriage awaited him, went
 48711	with hurried steps and bent head, not knowing where and why, along the
 48712	passage leading to the rooms on the ground floor. The countâs face was
 48713	white and he could not control the feverish twitching of his lower jaw.
 48714	
 48715	âThis way, your excellency... Where are you going?... This way,
 48716	please...â said a trembling, frightened voice behind him.
 48717	
 48718	Count RostopchÃ­n was unable to reply and, turning obediently, went in
 48719	the direction indicated. At the back entrance stood his calÃ¨che. The
 48720	distant roar of the yelling crowd was audible even there. He hastily
 48721	took his seat and told the coachman to drive him to his country house in
 48722	SokÃ³lniki.
 48723	
 48724	When they reached the MyasnÃ­tski Street and could no longer hear
 48725	the shouts of the mob, the count began to repent. He remembered with
 48726	dissatisfaction the agitation and fear he had betrayed before his
 48727	subordinates. âThe mob is terribleâdisgusting,â he said to himself
 48728	in French. âThey are like wolves whom nothing but flesh can appease.â
 48729	âCount! One God is above us both!ââVereshchÃ¡ginâs words suddenly
 48730	recurred to him, and a disagreeable shiver ran down his back. But this
 48731	was only a momentary feeling and Count RostopchÃ­n smiled disdainfully
 48732	at himself. âI had other duties,â thought he. âThe people had to be
 48733	appeased. Many other victims have perished and are perishing for the
 48734	public goodââand he began thinking of his social duties to his family
 48735	and to the city entrusted to him, and of himselfânot himself as Theodore
 48736	VasÃ­lyevich RostopchÃ­n (he fancied that Theodore VasÃ­lyevich RostopchÃ­n
 48737	was sacrificing himself for the public good) but himself as governor,
 48738	the representative of authority and of the Tsar. âHad I been simply
 48739	Theodore VasÃ­lyevich my course of action would have been quite
 48740	different, but it was my duty to safeguard my life and dignity as
 48741	commander in chief.â
 48742	
 48743	Lightly swaying on the flexible springs of his carriage and no longer
 48744	hearing the terrible sounds of the crowd, RostopchÃ­n grew physically
 48745	calm and, as always happens, as soon as he became physically tranquil
 48746	his mind devised reasons why he should be mentally tranquil too. The
 48747	thought which tranquillized RostopchÃ­n was not a new one. Since the
 48748	world began and men have killed one another no one has ever committed
 48749	such a crime against his fellow man without comforting himself with
 48750	this same idea. This idea is le bien public, the hypothetical welfare of
 48751	other people.
 48752	
 48753	To a man not swayed by passion that welfare is never certain, but he
 48754	who commits such a crime always knows just where that welfare lies. And
 48755	RostopchÃ­n now knew it.
 48756	
 48757	Not only did his reason not reproach him for what he had done, but
 48758	he even found cause for self-satisfaction in having so successfully
 48759	contrived to avail himself of a convenient opportunity to punish a
 48760	criminal and at the same time pacify the mob.
 48761	
 48762	âVereshchÃ¡gin was tried and condemned to death,â thought RostopchÃ­n
 48763	(though the Senate had only condemned VereshchÃ¡gin to hard labor), âhe
 48764	was a traitor and a spy. I could not let him go unpunished and so I have
 48765	killed two birds with one stone: to appease the mob I gave them a victim
 48766	and at the same time punished a miscreant.â
 48767	
 48768	Having reached his country house and begun to give orders about domestic
 48769	arrangements, the count grew quite tranquil.
 48770	
 48771	Half an hour later he was driving with his fast horses across the
 48772	SokÃ³lniki field, no longer thinking of what had occurred but considering
 48773	what was to come. He was driving to the YaÃºza bridge where he had heard
 48774	that KutÃºzov was. Count RostopchÃ­n was mentally preparing the angry and
 48775	stinging reproaches he meant to address to KutÃºzov for his deception. He
 48776	would make that foxy old courtier feel that the responsibility for all
 48777	the calamities that would follow the abandonment of the city and the
 48778	ruin of Russia (as RostopchÃ­n regarded it) would fall upon his doting
 48779	old head. Planning beforehand what he would say to KutÃºzov, RostopchÃ­n
 48780	turned angrily in his calÃ¨che and gazed sternly from side to side.
 48781	
 48782	The SokÃ³lniki field was deserted. Only at the end of it, in front of the
 48783	almshouse and the lunatic asylum, could be seen some people in white
 48784	and others like them walking singly across the field shouting and
 48785	gesticulating.
 48786	
 48787	One of these was running to cross the path of Count RostopchÃ­nâs
 48788	carriage, and the count himself, his coachman, and his dragoons
 48789	looked with vague horror and curiosity at these released lunatics and
 48790	especially at the one running toward them.
 48791	
 48792	Swaying from side to side on his long, thin legs in his fluttering
 48793	dressing gown, this lunatic was running impetuously, his gaze fixed on
 48794	RostopchÃ­n, shouting something in a hoarse voice and making signs to him
 48795	to stop. The lunaticâs solemn, gloomy face was thin and yellow, with
 48796	its beard growing in uneven tufts. His black, agate pupils with
 48797	saffron-yellow whites moved restlessly near the lower eyelids.
 48798	
 48799	âStop! Pull up, I tell you!â he cried in a piercing voice, and again
 48800	shouted something breathlessly with emphatic intonations and gestures.
 48801	
 48802	Coming abreast of the calÃ¨che he ran beside it.
 48803	
 48804	âThrice have they slain me, thrice have I risen from the dead. They
 48805	stoned me, crucified me... I shall rise... shall rise... shall rise.
 48806	They have torn my body. The kingdom of God will be overthrown... Thrice
 48807	will I overthrow it and thrice re-establish it!â he cried, raising his
 48808	voice higher and higher.
 48809	
 48810	Count RostopchÃ­n suddenly grew pale as he had done when the crowd closed
 48811	in on VereshchÃ¡gin. He turned away. âGo fas... faster!â he cried in a
 48812	trembling voice to his coachman. The calÃ¨che flew over the ground as
 48813	fast as the horses could draw it, but for a long time Count RostopchÃ­n
 48814	still heard the insane despairing screams growing fainter in the
 48815	distance, while his eyes saw nothing but the astonished, frightened,
 48816	bloodstained face of âthe traitorâ in the fur-lined coat.
 48817	
 48818	Recent as that mental picture was, RostopchÃ­n already felt that it had
 48819	cut deep into his heart and drawn blood. Even now he felt clearly that
 48820	the gory trace of that recollection would not pass with time, but that
 48821	the terrible memory would, on the contrary, dwell in his heart ever more
 48822	cruelly and painfully to the end of his life. He seemed still to hear
 48823	the sound of his own words: âCut him down! I command it....â
 48824	
 48825	âWhy did I utter those words? It was by some accident I said them....
 48826	I need not have said them,â he thought. âAnd then nothing would have
 48827	happened.â He saw the frightened and then infuriated face of the dragoon
 48828	who dealt the blow, the look of silent, timid reproach that boy in the
 48829	fur-lined coat had turned upon him. âBut I did not do it for my own
 48830	sake. I was bound to act that way.... The mob, the traitor... the public
 48831	welfare,â thought he.
 48832	
 48833	Troops were still crowding at the YaÃºza bridge. It was hot. KutÃºzov,
 48834	dejected and frowning, sat on a bench by the bridge toying with his
 48835	whip in the sand when a calÃ¨che dashed up noisily. A man in a generalâs
 48836	uniform with plumes in his hat went up to KutÃºzov and said something
 48837	in French. It was Count RostopchÃ­n. He told KutÃºzov that he had come
 48838	because Moscow, the capital, was no more and only the army remained.
 48839	
 48840	âThings would have been different if your Serene Highness had not told
 48841	me that you would not abandon Moscow without another battle; all this
 48842	would not have happened,â he said.
 48843	
 48844	KutÃºzov looked at RostopchÃ­n as if, not grasping what was said to him,
 48845	he was trying to read something peculiar written at that moment on the
 48846	face of the man addressing him. RostopchÃ­n grew confused and became
 48847	silent. KutÃºzov slightly shook his head and not taking his penetrating
 48848	gaze from RostopchÃ­nâs face muttered softly:
 48849	
 48850	âNo! I shall not give up Moscow without a battle!â
 48851	
 48852	Whether KutÃºzov was thinking of something entirely different when
 48853	he spoke those words, or uttered them purposely, knowing them to be
 48854	meaningless, at any rate RostopchÃ­n made no reply and hastily left him.
 48855	And strange to say, the Governor of Moscow, the proud Count RostopchÃ­n,
 48856	took up a Cossack whip and went to the bridge where he began with shouts
 48857	to drive on the carts that blocked the way.
 48858

 48863	CHAPTER XXVI
 48864	
 48865	Toward four oâclock in the afternoon Muratâs troops were entering
 48866	Moscow. In front rode a detachment of WÃ¼rttemberg hussars and behind
 48867	them rode the King of Naples himself accompanied by a numerous suite.
 48868	
 48869	About the middle of the ArbÃ¡t Street, near the Church of the Miraculous
 48870	Icon of St. Nicholas, Murat halted to await news from the advanced
 48871	detachment as to the condition in which they had found the citadel, le
 48872	Kremlin.
 48873	
 48874	Around Murat gathered a group of those who had remained in Moscow. They
 48875	all stared in timid bewilderment at the strange, long-haired commander
 48876	dressed up in feathers and gold.
 48877	
 48878	âIs that their Tsar himself? Heâs not bad!â low voices could be heard
 48879	saying.
 48880	
 48881	An interpreter rode up to the group.
 48882	
 48883	âTake off your cap... your caps!â These words went from one to another
 48884	in the crowd. The interpreter addressed an old porter and asked if
 48885	it was far to the KrÃ©mlin. The porter, listening in perplexity to the
 48886	unfamiliar Polish accent and not realizing that the interpreter was
 48887	speaking Russian, did not understand what was being said to him and
 48888	slipped behind the others.
 48889	
 48890	Murat approached the interpreter and told him to ask where the Russian
 48891	army was. One of the Russians understood what was asked and several
 48892	voices at once began answering the interpreter. A French officer,
 48893	returning from the advanced detachment, rode up to Murat and reported
 48894	that the gates of the citadel had been barricaded and that there was
 48895	probably an ambuscade there.
 48896	
 48897	âGood!â said Murat and, turning to one of the gentlemen in his suite,
 48898	ordered four light guns to be moved forward to fire at the gates.
 48899	
 48900	The guns emerged at a trot from the column following Murat and advanced
 48901	up the ArbÃ¡t. When they reached the end of the VozdvÃ­zhenka Street they
 48902	halted and drew in the Square. Several French officers superintended the
 48903	placing of the guns and looked at the KrÃ©mlin through field glasses.
 48904	
 48905	The bells in the KrÃ©mlin were ringing for vespers, and this sound
 48906	troubled the French. They imagined it to be a call to arms. A few
 48907	infantrymen ran to the KutÃ¡fyev Gate. Beams and wooden screens had been
 48908	put there, and two musket shots rang out from under the gate as soon as
 48909	an officer and men began to run toward it. A general who was standing
 48910	by the guns shouted some words of command to the officer, and the latter
 48911	ran back again with his men.
 48912	
 48913	The sound of three more shots came from the gate.
 48914	
 48915	One shot struck a French soldierâs foot, and from behind the screens
 48916	came the strange sound of a few voices shouting. Instantly as at a
 48917	word of command the expression of cheerful serenity on the faces of
 48918	the French general, officers, and men changed to one of determined
 48919	concentrated readiness for strife and suffering. To all of them from
 48920	the marshal to the least soldier, that place was not the VozdvÃ­zhenka,
 48921	MokhavÃ¡ya, or KutÃ¡fyev Street, nor the TrÃ³itsa Gate (places familiar in
 48922	Moscow), but a new battlefield which would probably prove sanguinary.
 48923	And all made ready for that battle. The cries from the gates ceased. The
 48924	guns were advanced, the artillerymen blew the ash off their linstocks,
 48925	and an officer gave the word âFire!â This was followed by two whistling
 48926	sounds of canister shot, one after another. The shot rattled against
 48927	the stone of the gate and upon the wooden beams and screens, and two
 48928	wavering clouds of smoke rose over the Square.
 48929	
 48930	A few instants after the echo of the reports resounding over the
 48931	stone-built KrÃ©mlin had died away the French heard a strange sound above
 48932	their head. Thousands of crows rose above the walls and circled in the
 48933	air, cawing and noisily flapping their wings. Together with that sound
 48934	came a solitary human cry from the gateway and amid the smoke appeared
 48935	the figure of a bareheaded man in a peasantâs coat. He grasped a musket
 48936	and took aim at the French. âFire!â repeated the officer once more,
 48937	and the reports of a musket and of two cannon shots were heard
 48938	simultaneously. The gate was again hidden by smoke.
 48939	
 48940	Nothing more stirred behind the screens and the French infantry soldiers
 48941	and officers advanced to the gate. In the gateway lay three wounded and
 48942	four dead. Two men in peasant coats ran away at the foot of the wall,
 48943	toward the ZnÃ¡menka.
 48944	
 48945	âClear that away!â said the officer, pointing to the beams and the
 48946	corpses, and the French soldiers, after dispatching the wounded, threw
 48947	the corpses over the parapet.
 48948	
 48949	Who these men were nobody knew. âClear that away!â was all that was said
 48950	of them, and they were thrown over the parapet and removed later on that
 48951	they might not stink. Thiers alone dedicates a few eloquent lines to
 48952	their memory: âThese wretches had occupied the sacred citadel, having
 48953	supplied themselves with guns from the arsenal, and firedâ (the
 48954	wretches) âat the French. Some of them were sabered and the KrÃ©mlin was
 48955	purged of their presence.â
 48956	
 48957	Murat was informed that the way had been cleared. The French entered
 48958	the gates and began pitching their camp in the Senate Square. Out of the
 48959	windows of the Senate House the soldiers threw chairs into the Square
 48960	for fuel and kindled fires there.
 48961	
 48962	Other detachments passed through the KrÃ©mlin and encamped along
 48963	the MorosÃ©yka, the LubyÃ¡nka, and PokrÃ³vka Streets. Others quartered
 48964	themselves along the VozdvÃ­zhenka, the NikÃ³lski, and the TverskÃ³y
 48965	Streets. No masters of the houses being found anywhere, the French were
 48966	not billeted on the inhabitants as is usual in towns but lived in it as
 48967	in a camp.
 48968	
 48969	Though tattered, hungry, worn out, and reduced to a third of their
 48970	original number, the French entered Moscow in good marching order. It
 48971	was a weary and famished, but still a fighting and menacing army. But
 48972	it remained an army only until its soldiers had dispersed into their
 48973	different lodgings. As soon as the men of the various regiments began
 48974	to disperse among the wealthy and deserted houses, the army was lost
 48975	forever and there came into being something nondescript, neither
 48976	citizens nor soldiers but what are known as marauders. When five weeks
 48977	later these same men left Moscow, they no longer formed an army. They
 48978	were a mob of marauders, each carrying a quantity of articles which
 48979	seemed to him valuable or useful. The aim of each man when he left
 48980	Moscow was no longer, as it had been, to conquer, but merely to keep
 48981	what he had acquired. Like a monkey which puts its paw into the narrow
 48982	neck of a jug, and having seized a handful of nuts will not open its
 48983	fist for fear of losing what it holds, and therefore perishes, the
 48984	French when they left Moscow had inevitably to perish because they
 48985	carried their loot with them, yet to abandon what they had stolen was as
 48986	impossible for them as it is for the monkey to open its paw and let
 48987	go of its nuts. Ten minutes after each regiment had entered a Moscow
 48988	district, not a soldier or officer was left. Men in military uniforms
 48989	and Hessian boots could be seen through the windows, laughing and
 48990	walking through the rooms. In cellars and storerooms similar men were
 48991	busy among the provisions, and in the yards unlocking or breaking open
 48992	coach house and stable doors, lighting fires in kitchens and kneading
 48993	and baking bread with rolled-up sleeves, and cooking; or frightening,
 48994	amusing, or caressing women and children. There were many such men both
 48995	in the shops and housesâbut there was no army.
 48996	
 48997	Order after order was issued by the French commanders that day
 48998	forbidding the men to disperse about the town, sternly forbidding any
 48999	violence to the inhabitants or any looting, and announcing a roll call
 49000	for that very evening. But despite all these measures the men, who had
 49001	till then constituted an army, flowed all over the wealthy, deserted
 49002	city with its comforts and plentiful supplies. As a hungry herd of
 49003	cattle keeps well together when crossing a barren field, but gets out
 49004	of hand and at once disperses uncontrollably as soon as it reaches rich
 49005	pastures, so did the army disperse all over the wealthy city.
 49006	
 49007	No residents were left in Moscow, and the soldiersâlike water
 49008	percolating through sandâspread irresistibly through the city in all
 49009	directions from the KrÃ©mlin into which they had first marched. The
 49010	cavalry, on entering a merchantâs house that had been abandoned and
 49011	finding there stabling more than sufficient for their horses, went on,
 49012	all the same, to the next house which seemed to them better. Many of
 49013	them appropriated several houses, chalked their names on them, and
 49014	quarreled and even fought with other companies for them. Before they had
 49015	had time to secure quarters the soldiers ran out into the streets to
 49016	see the city and, hearing that everything had been abandoned, rushed
 49017	to places where valuables were to be had for the taking. The officers
 49018	followed to check the soldiers and were involuntarily drawn into doing
 49019	the same. In Carriage Row carriages had been left in the shops, and
 49020	generals flocked there to select calÃ¨ches and coaches for themselves.
 49021	The few inhabitants who had remained invited commanding officers to
 49022	their houses, hoping thereby to secure themselves from being plundered.
 49023	There were masses of wealth and there seemed no end to it. All around
 49024	the quarters occupied by the French were other regions still unexplored
 49025	and unoccupied where, they thought, yet greater riches might be found.
 49026	And Moscow engulfed the army ever deeper and deeper. When water is
 49027	spilled on dry ground both the dry ground and the water disappear and
 49028	mud results; and in the same way the entry of the famished army into the
 49029	rich and deserted city resulted in fires and looting and the destruction
 49030	of both the army and the wealthy city.
 49031	
 49032	
 49033	The French attributed the Fire of Moscow au patriotisme fÃ©roce de
 49034	RostopchÃ­ne, * the Russians to the barbarity of the French. In reality,
 49035	however, it was not, and could not be, possible to explain the burning
 49036	of Moscow by making any individual, or any group of people, responsible
 49037	for it. Moscow was burned because it found itself in a position in which
 49038	any town built of wood was bound to burn, quite apart from whether it
 49039	had, or had not, a hundred and thirty inferior fire engines. Deserted
 49040	Moscow had to burn as inevitably as a heap of shavings has to burn on
 49041	which sparks continually fall for several days. A town built of wood,
 49042	where scarcely a day passes without conflagrations when the house owners
 49043	are in residence and a police force is present, cannot help burning when
 49044	its inhabitants have left it and it is occupied by soldiers who smoke
 49045	pipes, make campfires of the Senate chairs in the Senate Square, and
 49046	cook themselves meals twice a day. In peacetime it is only necessary to
 49047	billet troops in the villages of any district and the number of fires in
 49048	that district immediately increases. How much then must the probability
 49049	of fire be increased in an abandoned, wooden town where foreign troops
 49050	are quartered. âLe patriotisme fÃ©roce de RostopchÃ­neâ and the barbarity
 49051	of the French were not to blame in the matter. Moscow was set on fire by
 49052	the soldiersâ pipes, kitchens, and campfires, and by the carelessness of
 49053	enemy soldiers occupying houses they did not own. Even if there was any
 49054	arson (which is very doubtful, for no one had any reason to burn the
 49055	housesâin any case a troublesome and dangerous thing to do), arson
 49056	cannot be regarded as the cause, for the same thing would have happened
 49057	without any incendiarism.
 49058	
 49059	    * To RostopchÃ­nâs ferocious patriotism.
 49060	
 49061	However tempting it might be for the French to blame RostopchÃ­nâs
 49062	ferocity and for Russians to blame the scoundrel Bonaparte, or later
 49063	on to place an heroic torch in the hands of their own people, it is
 49064	impossible not to see that there could be no such direct cause of the
 49065	fire, for Moscow had to burn as every village, factory, or house must
 49066	burn which is left by its owners and in which strangers are allowed to
 49067	live and cook their porridge. Moscow was burned by its inhabitants, it
 49068	is true, but by those who had abandoned it and not by those who remained
 49069	in it. Moscow when occupied by the enemy did not remain intact like
 49070	Berlin, Vienna, and other towns, simply because its inhabitants
 49071	abandoned it and did not welcome the French with bread and salt, nor
 49072	bring them the keys of the city.

 49078	CHAPTER XXVII
 49079	
 49080	The absorption of the French by Moscow, radiating starwise as it did,
 49081	only reached the quarter where Pierre was staying by the evening of the
 49082	second of September.
 49083	
 49084	After the last two days spent in solitude and unusual circumstances,
 49085	Pierre was in a state bordering on insanity. He was completely obsessed
 49086	by one persistent thought. He did not know how or when this thought had
 49087	taken such possession of him, but he remembered nothing of the past,
 49088	understood nothing of the present, and all he saw and heard appeared to
 49089	him like a dream.
 49090	
 49091	He had left home only to escape the intricate tangle of lifeâs demands
 49092	that enmeshed him, and which in his present condition he was unable
 49093	to unravel. He had gone to Joseph AlexÃ©evichâs house, on the plea of
 49094	sorting the deceasedâs books and papers, only in search of rest from
 49095	lifeâs turmoil, for in his mind the memory of Joseph AlexÃ©evich was
 49096	connected with a world of eternal, solemn, and calm thoughts, quite
 49097	contrary to the restless confusion into which he felt himself being
 49098	drawn. He sought a quiet refuge, and in Joseph AlexÃ©evichâs study he
 49099	really found it. When he sat with his elbows on the dusty writing table
 49100	in the deathlike stillness of the study, calm and significant memories
 49101	of the last few days rose one after another in his imagination,
 49102	particularly of the battle of BorodinÃ³ and of that vague sense of his
 49103	own insignificance and insincerity compared with the truth, simplicity,
 49104	and strength of the class of men he mentally classed as they. When
 49105	GerÃ¡sim roused him from his reverie the idea occurred to him of taking
 49106	part in the popular defense of Moscow which he knew was projected. And
 49107	with that object he had asked GerÃ¡sim to get him a peasantâs coat and
 49108	a pistol, confiding to him his intentions of remaining in Joseph
 49109	AlexÃ©evichâs house and keeping his name secret. Then during the first
 49110	day spent in inaction and solitude (he tried several times to fix his
 49111	attention on the Masonic manuscripts, but was unable to do so) the idea
 49112	that had previously occurred to him of the cabalistic significance of
 49113	his name in connection with Bonaparteâs more than once vaguely presented
 49114	itself. But the idea that he, Lârusse Besuhof, was destined to set a
 49115	limit to the power of the Beast was as yet only one of the fancies that
 49116	often passed through his mind and left no trace behind.
 49117	
 49118	When, having bought the coat merely with the object of taking part among
 49119	the people in the defense of Moscow, Pierre had met the RostÃ³vs and
 49120	NatÃ¡sha had said to him: âAre you remaining in Moscow?... How splendid!â
 49121	the thought flashed into his mind that it really would be a good thing,
 49122	even if Moscow were taken, for him to remain there and do what he was
 49123	predestined to do.
 49124	
 49125	Next day, with the sole idea of not sparing himself and not lagging in
 49126	any way behind them, Pierre went to the Three Hills gate. But when he
 49127	returned to the house convinced that Moscow would not be defended, he
 49128	suddenly felt that what before had seemed to him merely a possibility
 49129	had now become absolutely necessary and inevitable. He must remain in
 49130	Moscow, concealing his name, and must meet Napoleon and kill him, and
 49131	either perish or put an end to the misery of all Europeâwhich it seemed
 49132	to him was solely due to Napoleon.
 49133	
 49134	Pierre knew all the details of the attempt on Bonaparteâs life in 1809
 49135	by a German student in Vienna, and knew that the student had been shot.
 49136	And the risk to which he would expose his life by carrying out his
 49137	design excited him still more.
 49138	
 49139	Two equally strong feelings drew Pierre irresistibly to this purpose.
 49140	The first was a feeling of the necessity of sacrifice and suffering in
 49141	view of the common calamity, the same feeling that had caused him to go
 49142	to MozhÃ¡ysk on the twenty-fifth and to make his way to the very thick
 49143	of the battle and had now caused him to run away from his home and, in
 49144	place of the luxury and comfort to which he was accustomed, to sleep
 49145	on a hard sofa without undressing and eat the same food as GerÃ¡sim.
 49146	The other was that vague and quite Russian feeling of contempt for
 49147	everything conventional, artificial, and humanâfor everything the
 49148	majority of men regard as the greatest good in the world. Pierre had
 49149	first experienced this strange and fascinating feeling at the SlobÃ³da
 49150	Palace, when he had suddenly felt that wealth, power, and lifeâall that
 49151	men so painstakingly acquire and guardâif it has any worth has so only
 49152	by reason of the joy with which it can all be renounced.
 49153	
 49154	It was the feeling that induces a volunteer recruit to spend his last
 49155	penny on drink, and a drunken man to smash mirrors or glasses for no
 49156	apparent reason and knowing that it will cost him all the money he
 49157	possesses: the feeling which causes a man to perform actions which from
 49158	an ordinary point of view are insane, to test, as it were, his personal
 49159	power and strength, affirming the existence of a higher, nonhuman
 49160	criterion of life.
 49161	
 49162	From the very day Pierre had experienced this feeling for the first time
 49163	at the SlobÃ³da Palace he had been continuously under its influence, but
 49164	only now found full satisfaction for it. Moreover, at this moment Pierre
 49165	was supported in his design and prevented from renouncing it by what he
 49166	had already done in that direction. If he were now to leave Moscow like
 49167	everyone else, his flight from home, the peasant coat, the pistol, and
 49168	his announcement to the RostÃ³vs that he would remain in Moscow would all
 49169	become not merely meaningless but contemptible and ridiculous, and to
 49170	this Pierre was very sensitive.
 49171	
 49172	Pierreâs physical condition, as is always the case, corresponded to his
 49173	mental state. The unaccustomed coarse food, the vodka he drank during
 49174	those days, the absence of wine and cigars, his dirty unchanged linen,
 49175	two almost sleepless nights passed on a short sofa without beddingâall
 49176	this kept him in a state of excitement bordering on insanity.
 49177	
 49178	It was two oâclock in the afternoon. The French had already entered
 49179	Moscow. Pierre knew this, but instead of acting he only thought about
 49180	his undertaking, going over its minutest details in his mind. In his
 49181	fancy he did not clearly picture to himself either the striking of the
 49182	blow or the death of Napoleon, but with extraordinary vividness and
 49183	melancholy enjoyment imagined his own destruction and heroic endurance.
 49184	
 49185	âYes, alone, for the sake of all, I must do it or perish!â he thought.
 49186	âYes, I will approach... and then suddenly... with pistol or dagger?
 49187	But that is all the same! âIt is not I but the hand of Providence that
 49188	punishes thee,â I shall say,â thought he, imagining what he would say
 49189	when killing Napoleon. âWell then, take me and execute me!â he went on,
 49190	speaking to himself and bowing his head with a sad but firm expression.
 49191	
 49192	While Pierre, standing in the middle of the room, was talking to himself
 49193	in this way, the study door opened and on the threshold appeared
 49194	the figure of MakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich, always so timid before but now quite
 49195	transformed.
 49196	
 49197	His dressing gown was unfastened, his face red and distorted. He
 49198	was obviously drunk. On seeing Pierre he grew confused at first, but
 49199	noticing embarrassment on Pierreâs face immediately grew bold and,
 49200	staggering on his thin legs, advanced into the middle of the room.
 49201	
 49202	âTheyâre frightened,â he said confidentially in a hoarse voice. âI say I
 49203	wonât surrender, I say... Am I not right, sir?â
 49204	
 49205	He paused and then suddenly seeing the pistol on the table seized it
 49206	with unexpected rapidity and ran out into the corridor.
 49207	
 49208	GerÃ¡sim and the porter, who had followed MakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich, stopped him
 49209	in the vestibule and tried to take the pistol from him. Pierre, coming
 49210	out into the corridor, looked with pity and repulsion at the half-crazy
 49211	old man. MakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich, frowning with exertion, held on to the pistol
 49212	and screamed hoarsely, evidently with some heroic fancy in his head.
 49213	
 49214	âTo arms! Board them! No, you shanât get it,â he yelled.
 49215	
 49216	âThat will do, please, that will do. Have the goodnessâplease, sir, to
 49217	let go! Please, sir...â pleaded GerÃ¡sim, trying carefully to steer MakÃ¡r
 49218	AlexÃ©evich by the elbows back to the door.
 49219	
 49220	âWho are you? Bonaparte!...â shouted MakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich.
 49221	
 49222	âThatâs not right, sir. Come to your room, please, and rest. Allow me to
 49223	have the pistol.â
 49224	
 49225	âBe off, thou base slave! Touch me not! See this?â shouted MakÃ¡r
 49226	AlexÃ©evich, brandishing the pistol. âBoard them!â
 49227	
 49228	âCatch hold!â whispered GerÃ¡sim to the porter.
 49229	
 49230	They seized MakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich by the arms and dragged him to the door.
 49231	
 49232	The vestibule was filled with the discordant sounds of a struggle and of
 49233	a tipsy, hoarse voice.
 49234	
 49235	Suddenly a fresh sound, a piercing feminine scream, reverberated from
 49236	the porch and the cook came running into the vestibule.
 49237	
 49238	âItâs them! Gracious heavens! O Lord, four of them, horsemen!â she
 49239	cried.
 49240	
 49241	GerÃ¡sim and the porter let MakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich go, and in the now silent
 49242	corridor the sound of several hands knocking at the front door could be
 49243	heard.
 49244	
 49245	
 49246	
 49247	
 49248	
 49249	CHAPTER XXVIII
 49250	
 49251	Pierre, having decided that until he had carried out his design he would
 49252	disclose neither his identity nor his knowledge of French, stood at the
 49253	half-open door of the corridor, intending to conceal himself as soon
 49254	as the French entered. But the French entered and still Pierre did not
 49255	retireâan irresistible curiosity kept him there.
 49256	
 49257	There were two of them. One was an officerâa tall, soldierly, handsome
 49258	manâthe other evidently a private or an orderly, sunburned, short, and
 49259	thin, with sunken cheeks and a dull expression. The officer walked in
 49260	front, leaning on a stick and slightly limping. When he had advanced
 49261	a few steps he stopped, having apparently decided that these were good
 49262	quarters, turned round to the soldiers standing at the entrance, and in
 49263	a loud voice of command ordered them to put up the horses. Having done
 49264	that, the officer, lifting his elbow with a smart gesture, stroked his
 49265	mustache and lightly touched his hat.
 49266	
 49267	âBonjour, la compagnie!â * said he gaily, smiling and looking about him.
 49268	
 49269	    * âGood day, everybody!â
 49270	
 49271	
 49272	No one gave any reply.
 49273	
 49274	âVous Ãªtes le bourgeois?â * the officer asked GerÃ¡sim.
 49275	
 49276	    * âAre you the master here?â
 49277	
 49278	
 49279	GerÃ¡sim gazed at the officer with an alarmed and inquiring look.
 49280	
 49281	âQuartier, quartier, logement!â said the officer, looking down at the
 49282	little man with a condescending and good-natured smile. âLes franÃ§ais
 49283	sont de bons enfants. Que diable! Voyons! Ne nous fÃ¢chons pas, mon
 49284	vieux!â * added he, clapping the scared and silent GerÃ¡sim on the
 49285	shoulder. âWell, does no one speak French in this establishment?â he
 49286	asked again in French, looking around and meeting Pierreâs eyes. Pierre
 49287	moved away from the door.
 49288	
 49289	     * âQuarters, quarters, lodgings! The French are good
 49290	     fellows. What the devil! There, donât let us be cross, old
 49291	     fellow!â
 49292	
 49293	
 49294	Again the officer turned to GerÃ¡sim and asked him to show him the rooms
 49295	in the house.
 49296	
 49297	âMaster, not hereâdonât understand... me, you...â said GerÃ¡sim, trying
 49298	to render his words more comprehensible by contorting them.
 49299	
 49300	Still smiling, the French officer spread out his hands before GerÃ¡simâs
 49301	nose, intimating that he did not understand him either, and moved,
 49302	limping, to the door at which Pierre was standing. Pierre wished to go
 49303	away and conceal himself, but at that moment he saw MakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich
 49304	appearing at the open kitchen door with the pistol in his hand. With
 49305	a madmanâs cunning, MakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich eyed the Frenchman, raised his
 49306	pistol, and took aim.
 49307	
 49308	âBoard them!â yelled the tipsy man, trying to press the trigger. Hearing
 49309	the yell the officer turned round, and at the same moment Pierre threw
 49310	himself on the drunkard. Just when Pierre snatched at and struck up the
 49311	pistol MakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich at last got his fingers on the trigger, there
 49312	was a deafening report, and all were enveloped in a cloud of smoke. The
 49313	Frenchman turned pale and rushed to the door.
 49314	
 49315	Forgetting his intention of concealing his knowledge of French, Pierre,
 49316	snatching away the pistol and throwing it down, ran up to the officer
 49317	and addressed him in French.
 49318	
 49319	âYou are not wounded?â he asked.
 49320	
 49321	âI think not,â answered the Frenchman, feeling himself over. âBut I have
 49322	had a lucky escape this time,â he added, pointing to the damaged plaster
 49323	of the wall. âWho is that man?â said he, looking sternly at Pierre.
 49324	
 49325	âOh, I am really in despair at what has occurred,â said Pierre rapidly,
 49326	quite forgetting the part he had intended to play. âHe is an unfortunate
 49327	madman who did not know what he was doing.â
 49328	
 49329	The officer went up to MakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich and took him by the collar.
 49330	
 49331	MakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich was standing with parted lips, swaying, as if about to
 49332	fall asleep, as he leaned against the wall.
 49333	
 49334	âBrigand! You shall pay for this,â said the Frenchman, letting go
 49335	of him. âWe French are merciful after victory, but we do not pardon
 49336	traitors,â he added, with a look of gloomy dignity and a fine energetic
 49337	gesture.
 49338	
 49339	Pierre continued, in French, to persuade the officer not to hold that
 49340	drunken imbecile to account. The Frenchman listened in silence with the
 49341	same gloomy expression, but suddenly turned to Pierre with a smile. For
 49342	a few seconds he looked at him in silence. His handsome face assumed a
 49343	melodramatically gentle expression and he held out his hand.
 49344	
 49345	âYou have saved my life. You are French,â said he.
 49346	
 49347	For a Frenchman that deduction was indubitable. Only a Frenchman could
 49348	perform a great deed, and to save his lifeâthe life of M. Ramballe,
 49349	captain of the 13th Light Regimentâwas undoubtedly a very great deed.
 49350	
 49351	But however indubitable that conclusion and the officerâs conviction
 49352	based upon it, Pierre felt it necessary to disillusion him.
 49353	
 49354	âI am Russian,â he said quickly.
 49355	
 49356	âTut, tut, tut! Tell that to others,â said the officer, waving his
 49357	finger before his nose and smiling. âYou shall tell me all about that
 49358	presently. I am delighted to meet a compatriot. Well, and what are we
 49359	to do with this man?â he added, addressing himself to Pierre as to a
 49360	brother.
 49361	
 49362	Even if Pierre were not a Frenchman, having once received that loftiest
 49363	of human appellations he could not renounce it, said the officerâs look
 49364	and tone. In reply to his last question Pierre again explained who MakÃ¡r
 49365	AlexÃ©evich was and how just before their arrival that drunken imbecile
 49366	had seized the loaded pistol which they had not had time to recover from
 49367	him, and begged the officer to let the deed go unpunished.
 49368	
 49369	The Frenchman expanded his chest and made a majestic gesture with his
 49370	arm.
 49371	
 49372	âYou have saved my life! You are French. You ask his pardon? I grant it
 49373	you. Lead that man away!â said he quickly and energetically, and taking
 49374	the arm of Pierre whom he had promoted to be a Frenchman for saving his
 49375	life, he went with him into the room.
 49376	
 49377	The soldiers in the yard, hearing the shot, came into the passage asking
 49378	what had happened, and expressed their readiness to punish the culprits,
 49379	but the officer sternly checked them.
 49380	
 49381	âYou will be called in when you are wanted,â he said.
 49382	
 49383	The soldiers went out again, and the orderly, who had meanwhile had time
 49384	to visit the kitchen, came up to his officer.
 49385	
 49386	âCaptain, there is soup and a leg of mutton in the kitchen,â said he.
 49387	âShall I serve them up?â
 49388	
 49389	âYes, and some wine,â answered the captain.
 49390	
 49391	
 49392	
 49393	
 49394	
 49395	CHAPTER XXIX
 49396	
 49397	When the French officer went into the room with Pierre the latter again
 49398	thought it his duty to assure him that he was not French and wished to
 49399	go away, but the officer would not hear of it. He was so very polite,
 49400	amiable, good-natured, and genuinely grateful to Pierre for saving his
 49401	life that Pierre had not the heart to refuse, and sat down with him in
 49402	the parlorâthe first room they entered. To Pierreâs assurances that he
 49403	was not a Frenchman, the captain, evidently not understanding how anyone
 49404	could decline so flattering an appellation, shrugged his shoulders and
 49405	said that if Pierre absolutely insisted on passing for a Russian let it
 49406	be so, but for all that he would be forever bound to Pierre by gratitude
 49407	for saving his life.
 49408	
 49409	Had this man been endowed with the slightest capacity for perceiving the
 49410	feelings of others, and had he at all understood what Pierreâs feelings
 49411	were, the latter would probably have left him, but the manâs animated
 49412	obtuseness to everything other than himself disarmed Pierre.
 49413	
 49414	âA Frenchman or a Russian prince incognito,â said the officer, looking
 49415	at Pierreâs fine though dirty linen and at the ring on his finger.
 49416	âI owe my life to you and offer you my friendship. A Frenchman never
 49417	forgets either an insult or a service. I offer you my friendship. That
 49418	is all I can say.â
 49419	
 49420	There was so much good nature and nobility (in the French sense of the
 49421	word) in the officerâs voice, in the expression of his face and in
 49422	his gestures, that Pierre, unconsciously smiling in response to the
 49423	Frenchmanâs smile, pressed the hand held out to him.
 49424	
 49425	âCaptain Ramballe, of the 13th Light Regiment, Chevalier of the Legion
 49426	of Honor for the affair on the seventh of September,â he introduced
 49427	himself, a self-satisfied irrepressible smile puckering his lips under
 49428	his mustache. âWill you now be so good as to tell me with whom I have
 49429	the honor of conversing so pleasantly, instead of being in the ambulance
 49430	with that maniacâs bullet in my body?â
 49431	
 49432	Pierre replied that he could not tell him his name and, blushing,
 49433	began to try to invent a name and to say something about his reason for
 49434	concealing it, but the Frenchman hastily interrupted him.
 49435	
 49436	âOh, please!â said he. âI understand your reasons. You are an officer...
 49437	a superior officer perhaps. You have borne arms against us. Thatâs not
 49438	my business. I owe you my life. That is enough for me. I am quite at
 49439	your service. You belong to the gentry?â he concluded with a shade of
 49440	inquiry in his tone. Pierre bent his head. âYour baptismal name, if you
 49441	please. That is all I ask. Monsieur Pierre, you say.... Thatâs all I
 49442	want to know.â
 49443	
 49444	When the mutton and an omelet had been served and a samovar and vodka
 49445	brought, with some wine which the French had taken from a Russian cellar
 49446	and brought with them, Ramballe invited Pierre to share his dinner, and
 49447	himself began to eat greedily and quickly like a healthy and hungry man,
 49448	munching his food rapidly with his strong teeth, continually smacking
 49449	his lips, and repeatingââExcellent! Delicious!â His face grew red and
 49450	was covered with perspiration. Pierre was hungry and shared the dinner
 49451	with pleasure. Morel, the orderly, brought some hot water in a saucepan
 49452	and placed a bottle of claret in it. He also brought a bottle of kvass,
 49453	taken from the kitchen for them to try. That beverage was already known
 49454	to the French and had been given a special name. They called it limonade
 49455	de cochon (pigâs lemonade), and Morel spoke well of the limonade de
 49456	cochon he had found in the kitchen. But as the captain had the wine they
 49457	had taken while passing through Moscow, he left the kvass to Morel and
 49458	applied himself to the bottle of Bordeaux. He wrapped the bottle up
 49459	to its neck in a table napkin and poured out wine for himself and for
 49460	Pierre. The satisfaction of his hunger and the wine rendered the captain
 49461	still more lively and he chatted incessantly all through dinner.
 49462	
 49463	âYes, my dear Monsieur Pierre, I owe you a fine votive candle for
 49464	saving me from that maniac.... You see, I have bullets enough in my
 49465	body already. Here is one I got at Wagramâ (he touched his side) âand a
 49466	second at SmolÃ©nskââhe showed a scar on his cheekââand this leg which as
 49467	you see does not want to march, I got that on the seventh at the great
 49468	battle of la Moskowa. SacrÃ© Dieu! It was splendid! That deluge of fire
 49469	was worth seeing. It was a tough job you set us there, my word! You may
 49470	be proud of it! And on my honor, in spite of the cough I caught there, I
 49471	should be ready to begin again. I pity those who did not see it.â
 49472	
 49473	âI was there,â said Pierre.
 49474	
 49475	âBah, really? So much the better! You are certainly brave foes. The
 49476	great redoubt held out well, by my pipe!â continued the Frenchman. âAnd
 49477	you made us pay dear for it. I was at it three timesâsure as I sit here.
 49478	Three times we reached the guns and three times we were thrown back
 49479	like cardboard figures. Oh, it was beautiful, Monsieur Pierre! Your
 49480	grenadiers were splendid, by heaven! I saw them close up their ranks six
 49481	times in succession and march as if on parade. Fine fellows! Our King of
 49482	Naples, who knows whatâs what, cried âBravo!â Ha, ha! So you are one of
 49483	us soldiers!â he added, smiling, after a momentary pause. âSo much
 49484	the better, so much the better, Monsieur Pierre! Terrible in battle...
 49485	gallant... with the fairâ (he winked and smiled), âthatâs what the
 49486	French are, Monsieur Pierre, arenât they?â
 49487	
 49488	The captain was so naÃ¯vely and good-humoredly gay, so real, and so
 49489	pleased with himself that Pierre almost winked back as he looked merrily
 49490	at him. Probably the word âgallantâ turned the captainâs thoughts to the
 49491	state of Moscow.
 49492	
 49493	âApropos, tell me please, is it true that the women have all left
 49494	Moscow? What a queer idea! What had they to be afraid of?â
 49495	
 49496	âWould not the French ladies leave Paris if the Russians entered it?â
 49497	asked Pierre.
 49498	
 49499	âHa, ha, ha!â The Frenchman emitted a merry, sanguine chuckle, patting
 49500	Pierre on the shoulder. âWhat a thing to say!â he exclaimed. âParis?...
 49501	But Paris, Paris...â
 49502	
 49503	âParisâthe capital of the world,â Pierre finished his remark for him.
 49504	
 49505	The captain looked at Pierre. He had a habit of stopping short in the
 49506	middle of his talk and gazing intently with his laughing, kindly eyes.
 49507	
 49508	âWell, if you hadnât told me you were Russian, I should have wagered
 49509	that you were Parisian! You have that... I donât know what, that...â and
 49510	having uttered this compliment, he again gazed at him in silence.
 49511	
 49512	âI have been in Paris. I spent years there,â said Pierre.
 49513	
 49514	âOh yes, one sees that plainly. Paris!... A man who doesnât know Paris
 49515	is a savage. You can tell a Parisian two leagues off. Paris is Talma, la
 49516	DuchÃ©nois, Potier, the Sorbonne, the boulevards,â and noticing that
 49517	his conclusion was weaker than what had gone before, he added quickly:
 49518	âThere is only one Paris in the world. You have been to Paris and have
 49519	remained Russian. Well, I donât esteem you the less for it.â
 49520	
 49521	Under the influence of the wine he had drunk, and after the days he had
 49522	spent alone with his depressing thoughts, Pierre involuntarily enjoyed
 49523	talking with this cheerful and good-natured man.
 49524	
 49525	âTo return to your ladiesâI hear they are lovely. What a wretched idea
 49526	to go and bury themselves in the steppes when the French army is in
 49527	Moscow. What a chance those girls have missed! Your peasants, nowâthatâs
 49528	another thing; but you civilized people, you ought to know us better
 49529	than that. We took Vienna, Berlin, Madrid, Naples, Rome, Warsaw, all
 49530	the worldâs capitals.... We are feared, but we are loved. We are nice to
 49531	know. And then the Emperor...â he began, but Pierre interrupted him.
 49532	
 49533	âThe Emperor,â Pierre repeated, and his face suddenly became sad and
 49534	embarrassed, âis the Emperor...?â
 49535	
 49536	âThe Emperor? He is generosity, mercy, justice, order, geniusâthatâs
 49537	what the Emperor is! It is I, Ramballe, who tell you so.... I assure you
 49538	I was his enemy eight years ago. My father was an emigrant count.... But
 49539	that man has vanquished me. He has taken hold of me. I could not resist
 49540	the sight of the grandeur and glory with which he has covered France.
 49541	When I understood what he wantedâwhen I saw that he was preparing a bed
 49542	of laurels for us, you know, I said to myself: âThat is a monarch,â and
 49543	I devoted myself to him! So there! Oh yes, mon cher, he is the greatest
 49544	man of the ages past or future.â
 49545	
 49546	âIs he in Moscow?â Pierre stammered with a guilty look.
 49547	
 49548	The Frenchman looked at his guilty face and smiled.
 49549	
 49550	âNo, he will make his entry tomorrow,â he replied, and continued his
 49551	talk.
 49552	
 49553	Their conversation was interrupted by the cries of several voices at
 49554	the gate and by Morel, who came to say that some WÃ¼rttemberg hussars had
 49555	come and wanted to put up their horses in the yard where the captainâs
 49556	horses were. This difficulty had arisen chiefly because the hussars did
 49557	not understand what was said to them in French.
 49558	
 49559	The captain had their senior sergeant called in, and in a stern voice
 49560	asked him to what regiment he belonged, who was his commanding officer,
 49561	and by what right he allowed himself to claim quarters that were already
 49562	occupied. The German who knew little French, answered the two first
 49563	questions by giving the names of his regiment and of his commanding
 49564	officer, but in reply to the third question which he did not understand
 49565	said, introducing broken French into his own German, that he was the
 49566	quartermaster of the regiment and his commander had ordered him to
 49567	occupy all the houses one after another. Pierre, who knew German,
 49568	translated what the German said to the captain and gave the captainâs
 49569	reply to the WÃ¼rttemberg hussar in German. When he had understood what
 49570	was said to him, the German submitted and took his men elsewhere. The
 49571	captain went out into the porch and gave some orders in a loud voice.
 49572	
 49573	When he returned to the room Pierre was sitting in the same place as
 49574	before, with his head in his hands. His face expressed suffering. He
 49575	really was suffering at that moment. When the captain went out and he
 49576	was left alone, suddenly he came to himself and realized the position
 49577	he was in. It was not that Moscow had been taken or that the happy
 49578	conquerors were masters in it and were patronizing him. Painful as
 49579	that was it was not that which tormented Pierre at the moment. He was
 49580	tormented by the consciousness of his own weakness. The few glasses of
 49581	wine he had drunk and the conversation with this good-natured man had
 49582	destroyed the mood of concentrated gloom in which he had spent the last
 49583	few days and which was essential for the execution of his design. The
 49584	pistol, dagger, and peasant coat were ready. Napoleon was to enter the
 49585	town next day. Pierre still considered that it would be a useful and
 49586	worthy action to slay the evildoer, but now he felt that he would not
 49587	do it. He did not know why, but he felt a foreboding that he would not
 49588	carry out his intention. He struggled against the confession of his
 49589	weakness but dimly felt that he could not overcome it and that his
 49590	former gloomy frame of mind, concerning vengeance, killing, and
 49591	self-sacrifice, had been dispersed like dust by contact with the first
 49592	man he met.
 49593	
 49594	The captain returned to the room, limping slightly and whistling a tune.
 49595	
 49596	The Frenchmanâs chatter which had previously amused Pierre now repelled
 49597	him. The tune he was whistling, his gait, and the gesture with which
 49598	he twirled his mustache, all now seemed offensive. âI will go away
 49599	immediately. I wonât say another word to him,â thought Pierre. He
 49600	thought this, but still sat in the same place. A strange feeling of
 49601	weakness tied him to the spot; he wished to get up and go away, but
 49602	could not do so.
 49603	
 49604	The captain, on the other hand, seemed very cheerful. He paced up and
 49605	down the room twice. His eyes shone and his mustache twitched as if he
 49606	were smiling to himself at some amusing thought.
 49607	
 49608	âThe colonel of those WÃ¼rttembergers is delightful,â he suddenly said.
 49609	âHeâs a German, but a nice fellow all the same.... But heâs a German.â
 49610	He sat down facing Pierre. âBy the way, you know German, then?â
 49611	
 49612	Pierre looked at him in silence.
 49613	
 49614	âWhat is the German for âshelterâ?â
 49615	
 49616	âShelter?â Pierre repeated. âThe German for shelter is Unterkunft.â
 49617	
 49618	âHow do you say it?â the captain asked quickly and doubtfully.
 49619	
 49620	âUnterkunft,â Pierre repeated.
 49621	
 49622	âOnterkoff,â said the captain and looked at Pierre for some seconds with
 49623	laughing eyes. âThese Germans are first-rate fools, donât you think so,
 49624	Monsieur Pierre?â he concluded.
 49625	
 49626	âWell, letâs have another bottle of this Moscow Bordeaux, shall we?
 49627	Morel will warm us up another little bottle. Morel!â he called out
 49628	gaily.
 49629	
 49630	Morel brought candles and a bottle of wine. The captain looked at Pierre
 49631	by the candlelight and was evidently struck by the troubled expression
 49632	on his companionâs face. Ramballe, with genuine distress and sympathy in
 49633	his face, went up to Pierre and bent over him.
 49634	
 49635	âThere now, weâre sad,â said he, touching Pierreâs hand. âHave I
 49636	upset you? No, really, have you anything against me?â he asked Pierre.
 49637	âPerhaps itâs the state of affairs?â
 49638	
 49639	Pierre did not answer, but looked cordially into the Frenchmanâs eyes
 49640	whose expression of sympathy was pleasing to him.
 49641	
 49642	âHonestly, without speaking of what I owe you, I feel friendship for
 49643	you. Can I do anything for you? Dispose of me. It is for life and death.
 49644	I say it with my hand on my heart!â said he, striking his chest.
 49645	
 49646	âThank you,â said Pierre.
 49647	
 49648	The captain gazed intently at him as he had done when he learned that
 49649	âshelterâ was Unterkunft in German, and his face suddenly brightened.
 49650	
 49651	âWell, in that case, I drink to our friendship!â he cried gaily, filling
 49652	two glasses with wine.
 49653	
 49654	Pierre took one of the glasses and emptied it. Ramballe emptied his too,
 49655	again pressed Pierreâs hand, and leaned his elbows on the table in a
 49656	pensive attitude.
 49657	
 49658	âYes, my dear friend,â he began, âsuch is fortuneâs caprice. Who would
 49659	have said that I should be a soldier and a captain of dragoons in the
 49660	service of Bonaparte, as we used to call him? Yet here I am in Moscow
 49661	with him. I must tell you, mon cher,â he continued in the sad and
 49662	measured tones of a man who intends to tell a long story, âthat our name
 49663	is one of the most ancient in France.â
 49664	
 49665	And with a Frenchmanâs easy and naÃ¯ve frankness the captain told Pierre
 49666	the story of his ancestors, his childhood, youth, and manhood, and all
 49667	about his relations and his financial and family affairs, âma pauvre
 49668	mÃ¨reâ playing of course an important part in the story.
 49669	
 49670	âBut all that is only lifeâs setting, the real thing is loveâlove! Am I
 49671	not right, Monsieur Pierre?â said he, growing animated. âAnother glass?â
 49672	
 49673	Pierre again emptied his glass and poured himself out a third.
 49674	
 49675	âOh, women, women!â and the captain, looking with glistening eyes at
 49676	Pierre, began talking of love and of his love affairs.
 49677	
 49678	There were very many of these, as one could easily believe, looking
 49679	at the officerâs handsome, self-satisfied face, and noting the eager
 49680	enthusiasm with which he spoke of women. Though all Ramballeâs love
 49681	stories had the sensual character which Frenchmen regard as the special
 49682	charm and poetry of love, yet he told his story with such sincere
 49683	conviction that he alone had experienced and known all the charm of love
 49684	and he described women so alluringly that Pierre listened to him with
 49685	curiosity.
 49686	
 49687	It was plain that lâamour which the Frenchman was so fond of was not
 49688	that low and simple kind that Pierre had once felt for his wife, nor
 49689	was it the romantic love stimulated by himself that he experienced for
 49690	NatÃ¡sha. (Ramballe despised both these kinds of love equally: the one
 49691	he considered the âlove of clodhoppersâ and the other the âlove
 49692	of simpletons.â) Lâamour which the Frenchman worshiped consisted
 49693	principally in the unnaturalness of his relation to the woman and in a
 49694	combination of incongruities giving the chief charm to the feeling.
 49695	
 49696	Thus the captain touchingly recounted the story of his love for a
 49697	fascinating marquise of thirty-five and at the same time for a charming,
 49698	innocent child of seventeen, daughter of the bewitching marquise. The
 49699	conflict of magnanimity between the mother and the daughter, ending in
 49700	the motherâs sacrificing herself and offering her daughter in marriage
 49701	to her lover, even now agitated the captain, though it was the memory of
 49702	a distant past. Then he recounted an episode in which the husband played
 49703	the part of the lover, and heâthe loverâassumed the role of the husband,
 49704	as well as several droll incidents from his recollections of Germany,
 49705	where âshelterâ is called Unterkunft and where the husbands eat
 49706	sauerkraut and the young girls are âtoo blonde.â
 49707	
 49708	Finally, the latest episode in Poland still fresh in the captainâs
 49709	memory, and which he narrated with rapid gestures and glowing face, was
 49710	of how he had saved the life of a Pole (in general, the saving of
 49711	life continually occurred in the captainâs stories) and the Pole had
 49712	entrusted to him his enchanting wife (parisienne de cÅur) while himself
 49713	entering the French service. The captain was happy, the enchanting
 49714	Polish lady wished to elope with him, but, prompted by magnanimity, the
 49715	captain restored the wife to the husband, saying as he did so: âI have
 49716	saved your life, and I save your honor!â Having repeated these words the
 49717	captain wiped his eyes and gave himself a shake, as if driving away the
 49718	weakness which assailed him at this touching recollection.
 49719	
 49720	Listening to the captainâs tales, Pierreâas often happens late in the
 49721	evening and under the influence of wineâfollowed all that was told him,
 49722	understood it all, and at the same time followed a train of personal
 49723	memories which, he knew not why, suddenly arose in his mind. While
 49724	listening to these love stories his own love for NatÃ¡sha unexpectedly
 49725	rose to his mind, and going over the pictures of that love in his
 49726	imagination he mentally compared them with Ramballeâs tales. Listening
 49727	to the story of the struggle between love and duty, Pierre saw before
 49728	his eyes every minutest detail of his last meeting with the object of
 49729	his love at the SÃºkharev water tower. At the time of that meeting it had
 49730	not produced an effect upon himâhe had not even once recalled it. But
 49731	now it seemed to him that that meeting had had in it something very
 49732	important and poetic.
 49733	
 49734	âPeter KirÃ­lovich, come here! We have recognized you,â he now seemed
 49735	to hear the words she had uttered and to see before him her eyes, her
 49736	smile, her traveling hood, and a stray lock of her hair... and there
 49737	seemed to him something pathetic and touching in all this.
 49738	
 49739	Having finished his tale about the enchanting Polish lady, the captain
 49740	asked Pierre if he had ever experienced a similar impulse to sacrifice
 49741	himself for love and a feeling of envy of the legitimate husband.
 49742	
 49743	Challenged by this question Pierre raised his head and felt a need to
 49744	express the thoughts that filled his mind. He began to explain that he
 49745	understood love for a woman somewhat differently. He said that in all
 49746	his life he had loved and still loved only one woman, and that she could
 49747	never be his.
 49748	
 49749	âTiens!â said the captain.
 49750	
 49751	Pierre then explained that he had loved this woman from his earliest
 49752	years, but that he had not dared to think of her because she was too
 49753	young, and because he had been an illegitimate son without a name.
 49754	Afterwards when he had received a name and wealth he dared not think of
 49755	her because he loved her too well, placing her far above everything in
 49756	the world, and especially therefore above himself.
 49757	
 49758	When he had reached this point, Pierre asked the captain whether he
 49759	understood that.
 49760	
 49761	The captain made a gesture signifying that even if he did not understand
 49762	it he begged Pierre to continue.
 49763	
 49764	âPlatÃ³nic love, clouds...â he muttered.
 49765	
 49766	Whether it was the wine he had drunk, or an impulse of frankness, or the
 49767	thought that this man did not, and never would, know any of those who
 49768	played a part in his story, or whether it was all these things together,
 49769	something loosened Pierreâs tongue. Speaking thickly and with a faraway
 49770	look in his shining eyes, he told the whole story of his life: his
 49771	marriage, NatÃ¡shaâs love for his best friend, her betrayal of him, and
 49772	all his own simple relations with her. Urged on by Ramballeâs questions
 49773	he also told what he had at first concealedâhis own position and even
 49774	his name.
 49775	
 49776	More than anything else in Pierreâs story the captain was impressed by
 49777	the fact that Pierre was very rich, had two mansions in Moscow, and that
 49778	he had abandoned everything and not left the city, but remained there
 49779	concealing his name and station.
 49780	
 49781	When it was late at night they went out together into the street. The
 49782	night was warm and light. To the left of the house on the PokrÃ³vka a
 49783	fire glowedâthe first of those that were beginning in Moscow. To the
 49784	right and high up in the sky was the sickle of the waning moon and
 49785	opposite to it hung that bright comet which was connected in Pierreâs
 49786	heart with his love. At the gate stood GerÃ¡sim, the cook, and two
 49787	Frenchmen. Their laughter and their mutually incomprehensible remarks in
 49788	two languages could be heard. They were looking at the glow seen in the
 49789	town.
 49790	
 49791	There was nothing terrible in the one small, distant fire in the immense
 49792	city.
 49793	
 49794	Gazing at the high starry sky, at the moon, at the comet, and at the
 49795	glow from the fire, Pierre experienced a joyful emotion. âThere now,
 49796	how good it is, what more does one need?â thought he. And suddenly
 49797	remembering his intention he grew dizzy and felt so faint that he leaned
 49798	against the fence to save himself from falling.
 49799	
 49800	Without taking leave of his new friend, Pierre left the gate with
 49801	unsteady steps and returning to his room lay down on the sofa and
 49802	immediately fell asleep.
 49803	
 49804	
 49805	
 49806	
 49807	
 49808	CHAPTER XXX
 49809	
 49810	The glow of the first fire that began on the second of September was
 49811	watched from the various roads by the fugitive Muscovites and by the
 49812	retreating troops, with many different feelings.
 49813	
 49814	The RostÃ³v party spent the night at MytÃ­shchi, fourteen miles from
 49815	Moscow. They had started so late on the first of September, the road
 49816	had been so blocked by vehicles and troops, so many things had been
 49817	forgotten for which servants were sent back, that they had decided to
 49818	spend that night at a place three miles out of Moscow. The next morning
 49819	they woke late and were again delayed so often that they only got as far
 49820	as Great MytÃ­shchi. At ten oâclock that evening the RostÃ³v family and
 49821	the wounded traveling with them were all distributed in the yards and
 49822	huts of that large village. The RostÃ³vsâ servants and coachmen and the
 49823	orderlies of the wounded officers, after attending to their masters, had
 49824	supper, fed the horses, and came out into the porches.
 49825	
 49826	In a neighboring hut lay RaÃ©vskiâs adjutant with a fractured wrist. The
 49827	awful pain he suffered made him moan incessantly and piteously, and his
 49828	moaning sounded terrible in the darkness of the autumn night. He had
 49829	spent the first night in the same yard as the RostÃ³vs. The countess said
 49830	she had been unable to close her eyes on account of his moaning, and at
 49831	MytÃ­shchi she moved into a worse hut simply to be farther away from the
 49832	wounded man.
 49833	
 49834	In the darkness of the night one of the servants noticed, above the high
 49835	body of a coach standing before the porch, the small glow of another
 49836	fire. One glow had long been visible and everybody knew that it was
 49837	Little MytÃ­shchi burningâset on fire by MamÃ³novâs Cossacks.
 49838	
 49839	âBut look here, brothers, thereâs another fire!â remarked an orderly.
 49840	
 49841	All turned their attention to the glow.
 49842	
 49843	âBut they told us Little MytÃ­shchi had been set on fire by MamÃ³novâs
 49844	Cossacks.â
 49845	
 49846	âBut thatâs not MytÃ­shchi, itâs farther away.â
 49847	
 49848	âLook, it must be in Moscow!â
 49849	
 49850	Two of the gazers went round to the other side of the coach and sat down
 49851	on its steps.
 49852	
 49853	âItâs more to the left, why, Little MytÃ­shchi is over there, and this is
 49854	right on the other side.â
 49855	
 49856	Several men joined the first two.
 49857	
 49858	âSee how itâs flaring,â said one. âThatâs a fire in Moscow: either in
 49859	the SushchÃ©vski or the RogÃ³zhski quarter.â
 49860	
 49861	No one replied to this remark and for some time they all gazed silently
 49862	at the spreading flames of the second fire in the distance.
 49863	
 49864	Old Daniel TerÃ©ntich, the countâs valet (as he was called), came up to
 49865	the group and shouted at MÃ­shka.
 49866	
 49867	âWhat are you staring at, you good-for-nothing?... The count will be
 49868	calling and thereâs nobody there; go and gather the clothes together.â
 49869	
 49870	âI only ran out to get some water,â said MÃ­shka.
 49871	
 49872	âBut what do you think, Daniel TerÃ©ntich? Doesnât it look as if that
 49873	glow were in Moscow?â remarked one of the footmen.
 49874	
 49875	Daniel TerÃ©ntich made no reply, and again for a long time they were all
 49876	silent. The glow spread, rising and falling, farther and farther still.
 49877	
 49878	âGod have mercy.... Itâs windy and dry...â said another voice.
 49879	
 49880	âJust look! See what itâs doing now. O Lord! You can even see the crows
 49881	flying. Lord have mercy on us sinners!â
 49882	
 49883	âTheyâll put it out, no fear!â
 49884	
 49885	âWhoâs to put it out?â Daniel TerÃ©ntich, who had hitherto been silent,
 49886	was heard to say. His voice was calm and deliberate. âMoscow it is,
 49887	brothers,â said he. âMother Moscow, the white...â his voice faltered,
 49888	and he gave way to an old manâs sob.
 49889	
 49890	And it was as if they had all only waited for this to realize the
 49891	significance for them of the glow they were watching. Sighs were heard,
 49892	words of prayer, and the sobbing of the countâs old valet.
 49893

 49898	CHAPTER XXXI
 49899	
 49900	The valet, returning to the cottage, informed the count that Moscow was
 49901	burning. The count donned his dressing gown and went out to look. SÃ³nya
 49902	and Madame Schoss, who had not yet undressed, went out with him. Only
 49903	NatÃ¡sha and the countess remained in the room. PÃ©tya was no longer
 49904	with the family, he had gone on with his regiment which was making for
 49905	TrÃ³itsa.
 49906	
 49907	The countess, on hearing that Moscow was on fire, began to cry. NatÃ¡sha,
 49908	pale, with a fixed look, was sitting on the bench under the icons just
 49909	where she had sat down on arriving and paid no attention to her fatherâs
 49910	words. She was listening to the ceaseless moaning of the adjutant, three
 49911	houses off.
 49912	
 49913	âOh, how terrible,â said SÃ³nya returning from the yard chilled and
 49914	frightened. âI believe the whole of Moscow will burn, thereâs an awful
 49915	glow! NatÃ¡sha, do look! You can see it from the window,â she said to her
 49916	cousin, evidently wishing to distract her mind.
 49917	
 49918	But NatÃ¡sha looked at her as if not understanding what was said to her
 49919	and again fixed her eyes on the corner of the stove. She had been in
 49920	this condition of stupor since the morning, when SÃ³nya, to the surprise
 49921	and annoyance of the countess, had for some unaccountable reason found
 49922	it necessary to tell NatÃ¡sha of Prince Andrewâs wound and of his being
 49923	with their party. The countess had seldom been so angry with anyone as
 49924	she was with SÃ³nya. SÃ³nya had cried and begged to be forgiven and now,
 49925	as if trying to atone for her fault, paid unceasing attention to her
 49926	cousin.
 49927	
 49928	âLook, NatÃ¡sha, how dreadfully it is burning!â said she.
 49929	
 49930	âWhatâs burning?â asked NatÃ¡sha. âOh, yes, Moscow.â
 49931	
 49932	And as if in order not to offend SÃ³nya and to get rid of her, she turned
 49933	her face to the window, looked out in such a way that it was evident
 49934	that she could not see anything, and again settled down in her former
 49935	attitude.
 49936	
 49937	âBut you didnât see it!â
 49938	
 49939	âYes, really I did,â NatÃ¡sha replied in a voice that pleaded to be left
 49940	in peace.
 49941	
 49942	Both the countess and SÃ³nya understood that, naturally, neither Moscow
 49943	nor the burning of Moscow nor anything else could seem of importance to
 49944	NatÃ¡sha.
 49945	
 49946	The count returned and lay down behind the partition. The countess went
 49947	up to her daughter and touched her head with the back of her hand as she
 49948	was wont to do when NatÃ¡sha was ill, then touched her forehead with her
 49949	lips as if to feel whether she was feverish, and finally kissed her.
 49950	
 49951	âYou are cold. You are trembling all over. Youâd better lie down,â said
 49952	the countess.
 49953	
 49954	âLie down? All right, I will. Iâll lie down at once,â said NatÃ¡sha.
 49955	
 49956	When NatÃ¡sha had been told that morning that Prince Andrew was seriously
 49957	wounded and was traveling with their party, she had at first asked many
 49958	questions: Where was he going? How was he wounded? Was it serious? And
 49959	could she see him? But after she had been told that she could not see
 49960	him, that he was seriously wounded but that his life was not in danger,
 49961	she ceased to ask questions or to speak at all, evidently disbelieving
 49962	what they told her, and convinced that say what she might she would
 49963	still be told the same. All the way she had sat motionless in a corner
 49964	of the coach with wide open eyes, and the expression in them which the
 49965	countess knew so well and feared so much, and now she sat in the same
 49966	way on the bench where she had seated herself on arriving. She was
 49967	planning something and either deciding or had already decided something
 49968	in her mind. The countess knew this, but what it might be she did not
 49969	know, and this alarmed and tormented her.
 49970	
 49971	âNatÃ¡sha, undress, darling; lie down on my bed.â
 49972	
 49973	A bed had been made on a bedstead for the countess only. Madame Schoss
 49974	and the two girls were to sleep on some hay on the floor.
 49975	
 49976	âNo, Mamma, I will lie down here on the floor,â NatÃ¡sha replied
 49977	irritably and she went to the window and opened it. Through the open
 49978	window the moans of the adjutant could be heard more distinctly. She put
 49979	her head out into the damp night air, and the countess saw her slim neck
 49980	shaking with sobs and throbbing against the window frame. NatÃ¡sha knew
 49981	it was not Prince Andrew who was moaning. She knew Prince Andrew was in
 49982	the same yard as themselves and in a part of the hut across the passage;
 49983	but this dreadful incessant moaning made her sob. The countess exchanged
 49984	a look with SÃ³nya.
 49985	
 49986	âLie down, darling; lie down, my pet,â said the countess, softly
 49987	touching NatÃ¡shaâs shoulders. âCome, lie down.â
 49988	
 49989	âOh, yes... Iâll lie down at once,â said NatÃ¡sha, and began hurriedly
 49990	undressing, tugging at the tapes of her petticoat.
 49991	
 49992	When she had thrown off her dress and put on a dressing jacket, she sat
 49993	down with her foot under her on the bed that had been made up on the
 49994	floor, jerked her thin and rather short plait of hair to the front,
 49995	and began replaiting it. Her long, thin, practiced fingers rapidly
 49996	unplaited, replaited, and tied up her plait. Her head moved from side
 49997	to side from habit, but her eyes, feverishly wide, looked fixedly before
 49998	her. When her toilet for the night was finished she sank gently onto the
 49999	sheet spread over the hay on the side nearest the door.
 50000	
 50001	âNatÃ¡sha, youâd better lie in the middle,â said SÃ³nya.
 50002	
 50003	âIâll stay here,â muttered NatÃ¡sha. âDo lie down,â she added crossly,
 50004	and buried her face in the pillow.
 50005	
 50006	The countess, Madame Schoss, and SÃ³nya undressed hastily and lay down.
 50007	The small lamp in front of the icons was the only light left in
 50008	the room. But in the yard there was a light from the fire at Little
 50009	MytÃ­shchi a mile and a half away, and through the night came the noise
 50010	of people shouting at a tavern MamÃ³novâs Cossacks had set up across the
 50011	street, and the adjutantâs unceasing moans could still be heard.
 50012	
 50013	For a long time NatÃ¡sha listened attentively to the sounds that reached
 50014	her from inside and outside the room and did not move. First she heard
 50015	her mother praying and sighing and the creaking of her bed under
 50016	her, then Madame Schossâ familiar whistling snore and SÃ³nyaâs gentle
 50017	breathing. Then the countess called to NatÃ¡sha. NatÃ¡sha did not answer.
 50018	
 50019	âI think sheâs asleep, Mamma,â said SÃ³nya softly.
 50020	
 50021	After a short silence the countess spoke again but this time no one
 50022	replied.
 50023	
 50024	Soon after that NatÃ¡sha heard her motherâs even breathing. NatÃ¡sha did
 50025	not move, though her little bare foot, thrust out from under the quilt,
 50026	was growing cold on the bare floor.
 50027	
 50028	As if to celebrate a victory over everybody, a cricket chirped in a
 50029	crack in the wall. A cock crowed far off and another replied near
 50030	by. The shouting in the tavern had died down; only the moaning of the
 50031	adjutant was heard. NatÃ¡sha sat up.
 50032	
 50033	âSÃ³nya, are you asleep? Mamma?â she whispered.
 50034	
 50035	No one replied. NatÃ¡sha rose slowly and carefully, crossed herself, and
 50036	stepped cautiously on the cold and dirty floor with her slim, supple,
 50037	bare feet. The boards of the floor creaked. Stepping cautiously from one
 50038	foot to the other she ran like a kitten the few steps to the door and
 50039	grasped the cold door handle.
 50040	
 50041	It seemed to her that something heavy was beating rhythmically against
 50042	all the walls of the room: it was her own heart, sinking with alarm and
 50043	terror and overflowing with love.
 50044	
 50045	She opened the door and stepped across the threshold and onto the cold,
 50046	damp earthen floor of the passage. The cold she felt refreshed her. With
 50047	her bare feet she touched a sleeping man, stepped over him, and opened
 50048	the door into the part of the hut where Prince Andrew lay. It was dark
 50049	in there. In the farthest corner, on a bench beside a bed on which
 50050	something was lying, stood a tallow candle with a long, thick, and
 50051	smoldering wick.
 50052	
 50053	From the moment she had been told that morning of Prince Andrewâs wound
 50054	and his presence there, NatÃ¡sha had resolved to see him. She did not
 50055	know why she had to, she knew the meeting would be painful, but felt the
 50056	more convinced that it was necessary.
 50057	
 50058	All day she had lived only in hope of seeing him that night. But now
 50059	that the moment had come she was filled with dread of what she might
 50060	see. How was he maimed? What was left of him? Was he like that incessant
 50061	moaning of the adjutantâs? Yes, he was altogether like that. In her
 50062	imagination he was that terrible moaning personified. When she saw an
 50063	indistinct shape in the corner, and mistook his knees raised under the
 50064	quilt for his shoulders, she imagined a horrible body there, and stood
 50065	still in terror. But an irresistible impulse drew her forward. She
 50066	cautiously took one step and then another, and found herself in the
 50067	middle of a small room containing baggage. Another manâTimÃ³khinâwas
 50068	lying in a corner on the benches beneath the icons, and two othersâthe
 50069	doctor and a valetâlay on the floor.
 50070	
 50071	The valet sat up and whispered something. TimÃ³khin, kept awake by the
 50072	pain in his wounded leg, gazed with wide-open eyes at this strange
 50073	apparition of a girl in a white chemise, dressing jacket, and nightcap.
 50074	The valetâs sleepy, frightened exclamation, âWhat do you want? Whatâs
 50075	the matter?â made NatÃ¡sha approach more swiftly to what was lying in the
 50076	corner. Horribly unlike a man as that body looked, she must see him.
 50077	She passed the valet, the snuff fell from the candle wick, and she saw
 50078	Prince Andrew clearly with his arms outside the quilt, and such as she
 50079	had always seen him.
 50080	
 50081	He was the same as ever, but the feverish color of his face, his
 50082	glittering eyes rapturously turned toward her, and especially his neck,
 50083	delicate as a childâs, revealed by the turn-down collar of his shirt,
 50084	gave him a peculiarly innocent, childlike look, such as she had never
 50085	seen on him before. She went up to him and with a swift, flexible,
 50086	youthful movement dropped on her knees.
 50087	
 50088	He smiled and held out his hand to her.
 50089	
 50090	
 50091	
 50092	
 50093	
 50094	CHAPTER XXXII
 50095	
 50096	Seven days had passed since Prince Andrew found himself in the
 50097	ambulance station on the field of BorodinÃ³. His feverish state and the
 50098	inflammation of his bowels, which were injured, were in the doctorâs
 50099	opinion sure to carry him off. But on the seventh day he ate with
 50100	pleasure a piece of bread with some tea, and the doctor noticed that his
 50101	temperature was lower. He had regained consciousness that morning.
 50102	The first night after they left Moscow had been fairly warm and he had
 50103	remained in the calÃ¨che, but at MytÃ­shchi the wounded man himself asked
 50104	to be taken out and given some tea. The pain caused by his removal into
 50105	the hut had made him groan aloud and again lose consciousness. When he
 50106	had been placed on his camp bed he lay for a long time motionless with
 50107	closed eyes. Then he opened them and whispered softly: âAnd the tea?â
 50108	His remembering such a small detail of everyday life astonished
 50109	the doctor. He felt Prince Andrewâs pulse, and to his surprise and
 50110	dissatisfaction found it had improved. He was dissatisfied because he
 50111	knew by experience that if his patient did not die now, he would do so
 50112	a little later with greater suffering. TimÃ³khin, the red-nosed major of
 50113	Prince Andrewâs regiment, had joined him in Moscow and was being
 50114	taken along with him, having been wounded in the leg at the battle of
 50115	BorodinÃ³. They were accompanied by a doctor, Prince Andrewâs valet, his
 50116	coachman, and two orderlies.
 50117	
 50118	They gave Prince Andrew some tea. He drank it eagerly, looking with
 50119	feverish eyes at the door in front of him as if trying to understand and
 50120	remember something.
 50121	
 50122	âI donât want any more. Is TimÃ³khin here?â he asked.
 50123	
 50124	TimÃ³khin crept along the bench to him.
 50125	
 50126	âI am here, your excellency.â
 50127	
 50128	âHowâs your wound?â
 50129	
 50130	âMine, sir? All right. But how about you?â
 50131	
 50132	Prince Andrew again pondered as if trying to remember something.
 50133	
 50134	âCouldnât one get a book?â he asked.
 50135	
 50136	âWhat book?â
 50137	
 50138	âThe Gospels. I havenât one.â
 50139	
 50140	The doctor promised to procure it for him and began to ask how he
 50141	was feeling. Prince Andrew answered all his questions reluctantly but
 50142	reasonably, and then said he wanted a bolster placed under him as he was
 50143	uncomfortable and in great pain. The doctor and valet lifted the cloak
 50144	with which he was covered and, making wry faces at the noisome smell of
 50145	mortifying flesh that came from the wound, began examining that dreadful
 50146	place. The doctor was very much displeased about something and made a
 50147	change in the dressings, turning the wounded man over so that he groaned
 50148	again and grew unconscious and delirious from the agony. He kept asking
 50149	them to get him the book and put it under him.
 50150	
 50151	âWhat trouble would it be to you?â he said. âI have not got one. Please
 50152	get it for me and put it under for a moment,â he pleaded in a piteous
 50153	voice.
 50154	
 50155	The doctor went into the passage to wash his hands.
 50156	
 50157	âYou fellows have no conscience,â said he to the valet who was pouring
 50158	water over his hands. âFor just one moment I didnât look after you...
 50159	Itâs such pain, you know, that I wonder how he can bear it.â
 50160	
 50161	âBy the Lord Jesus Christ, I thought we had put something under him!â
 50162	said the valet.
 50163	
 50164	The first time Prince Andrew understood where he was and what was the
 50165	matter with him and remembered being wounded and how was when he asked
 50166	to be carried into the hut after his calÃ¨che had stopped at MytÃ­shchi.
 50167	After growing confused from pain while being carried into the hut he
 50168	again regained consciousness, and while drinking tea once more recalled
 50169	all that had happened to him, and above all vividly remembered the
 50170	moment at the ambulance station when, at the sight of the sufferings of
 50171	a man he disliked, those new thoughts had come to him which promised him
 50172	happiness. And those thoughts, though now vague and indefinite, again
 50173	possessed his soul. He remembered that he had now a new source of
 50174	happiness and that this happiness had something to do with the Gospels.
 50175	That was why he asked for a copy of them. The uncomfortable position in
 50176	which they had put him and turned him over again confused his thoughts,
 50177	and when he came to himself a third time it was in the complete
 50178	stillness of the night. Everybody near him was sleeping. A cricket
 50179	chirped from across the passage; someone was shouting and singing in
 50180	the street; cockroaches rustled on the table, on the icons, and on
 50181	the walls, and a big fly flopped at the head of the bed and around the
 50182	candle beside him, the wick of which was charred and had shaped itself
 50183	like a mushroom.
 50184	
 50185	His mind was not in a normal state. A healthy man usually thinks of,
 50186	feels, and remembers innumerable things simultaneously, but has the
 50187	power and will to select one sequence of thoughts or events on which to
 50188	fix his whole attention. A healthy man can tear himself away from the
 50189	deepest reflections to say a civil word to someone who comes in and can
 50190	then return again to his own thoughts. But Prince Andrewâs mind was not
 50191	in a normal state in that respect. All the powers of his mind were more
 50192	active and clearer than ever, but they acted apart from his will. Most
 50193	diverse thoughts and images occupied him simultaneously. At times his
 50194	brain suddenly began to work with a vigor, clearness, and depth it had
 50195	never reached when he was in health, but suddenly in the midst of its
 50196	work it would turn to some unexpected idea and he had not the strength
 50197	to turn it back again.
 50198	
 50199	âYes, a new happiness was revealed to me of which man cannot be
 50200	deprived,â he thought as he lay in the semidarkness of the quiet hut,
 50201	gazing fixedly before him with feverish wide open eyes. âA happiness
 50202	lying beyond material forces, outside the material influences that act
 50203	on manâa happiness of the soul alone, the happiness of loving. Every man
 50204	can understand it, but to conceive it and enjoin it was possible only
 50205	for God. But how did God enjoin that law? And why was the Son...?â
 50206	
 50207	And suddenly the sequence of these thoughts broke off, and Prince Andrew
 50208	heard (without knowing whether it was a delusion or reality) a
 50209	soft whispering voice incessantly and rhythmically repeating
 50210	âpiti-piti-piti,â and then âtiti,â and then again âpiti-piti-piti,â and
 50211	âti-tiâ once more. At the same time he felt that above his face, above
 50212	the very middle of it, some strange airy structure was being erected out
 50213	of slender needles or splinters, to the sound of this whispered music.
 50214	He felt that he had to balance carefully (though it was difficult) so
 50215	that this airy structure should not collapse; but nevertheless it kept
 50216	collapsing and again slowly rising to the sound of whispered rhythmic
 50217	musicââit stretches, stretches, spreading out and stretching,â said
 50218	Prince Andrew to himself. While listening to this whispering and feeling
 50219	the sensation of this drawing out and the construction of this edifice
 50220	of needles, he also saw by glimpses a red halo round the candle, and
 50221	heard the rustle of the cockroaches and the buzzing of the fly that
 50222	flopped against his pillow and his face. Each time the fly touched his
 50223	face it gave him a burning sensation and yet to his surprise it did not
 50224	destroy the structure, though it knocked against the very region of his
 50225	face where it was rising. But besides this there was something else of
 50226	importance. It was something white by the doorâthe statue of a sphinx,
 50227	which also oppressed him.
 50228	
 50229	âBut perhaps thatâs my shirt on the table,â he thought, âand thatâs my
 50230	legs, and that is the door, but why is it always stretching and drawing
 50231	itself out, and âpiti-piti-pitiâ and âti-tiâ and âpiti-piti-pitiâ...?
 50232	Thatâs enough, please leave off!â Prince Andrew painfully entreated
 50233	someone. And suddenly thoughts and feelings again swam to the surface of
 50234	his mind with peculiar clearness and force.
 50235	
 50236	âYesâlove,â he thought again quite clearly. âBut not love which loves
 50237	for something, for some quality, for some purpose, or for some reason,
 50238	but the love which Iâwhile dyingâfirst experienced when I saw my enemy
 50239	and yet loved him. I experienced that feeling of love which is the very
 50240	essence of the soul and does not require an object. Now again I feel
 50241	that bliss. To love oneâs neighbors, to love oneâs enemies, to love
 50242	everything, to love God in all His manifestations. It is possible to
 50243	love someone dear to you with human love, but an enemy can only be loved
 50244	by divine love. That is why I experienced such joy when I felt that I
 50245	loved that man. What has become of him? Is he alive?...
 50246	
 50247	âWhen loving with human love one may pass from love to hatred, but
 50248	divine love cannot change. No, neither death nor anything else can
 50249	destroy it. It is the very essence of the soul. Yet how many people have
 50250	I hated in my life? And of them all, I loved and hated none as I did
 50251	her.â And he vividly pictured to himself NatÃ¡sha, not as he had done in
 50252	the past with nothing but her charms which gave him delight, but for
 50253	the first time picturing to himself her soul. And he understood her
 50254	feelings, her sufferings, shame, and remorse. He now understood for the
 50255	first time all the cruelty of his rejection of her, the cruelty of his
 50256	rupture with her. âIf only it were possible for me to see her once more!
 50257	Just once, looking into those eyes to say...â
 50258	
 50259	âPiti-piti-piti and ti-ti and piti-piti-piti boom!â flopped the fly....
 50260	And his attention was suddenly carried into another world, a world of
 50261	reality and delirium in which something particular was happening. In
 50262	that world some structure was still being erected and did not fall,
 50263	something was still stretching out, and the candle with its red halo
 50264	was still burning, and the same shirtlike sphinx lay near the door; but
 50265	besides all this something creaked, there was a whiff of fresh air, and
 50266	a new white sphinx appeared, standing at the door. And that sphinx had
 50267	the pale face and shining eyes of the very NatÃ¡sha of whom he had just
 50268	been thinking.
 50269	
 50270	âOh, how oppressive this continual delirium is,â thought Prince Andrew,
 50271	trying to drive that face from his imagination. But the face remained
 50272	before him with the force of reality and drew nearer. Prince Andrew
 50273	wished to return to that former world of pure thought, but he could not,
 50274	and delirium drew him back into its domain. The soft whispering voice
 50275	continued its rhythmic murmur, something oppressed him and stretched
 50276	out, and the strange face was before him. Prince Andrew collected all
 50277	his strength in an effort to recover his senses, he moved a little, and
 50278	suddenly there was a ringing in his ears, a dimness in his eyes, and
 50279	like a man plunged into water he lost consciousness. When he came to
 50280	himself, NatÃ¡sha, that same living NatÃ¡sha whom of all people he most
 50281	longed to love with this new pure divine love that had been revealed to
 50282	him, was kneeling before him. He realized that it was the real living
 50283	NatÃ¡sha, and he was not surprised but quietly happy. NatÃ¡sha, motionless
 50284	on her knees (she was unable to stir), with frightened eyes riveted on
 50285	him, was restraining her sobs. Her face was pale and rigid. Only in the
 50286	lower part of it something quivered.
 50287	
 50288	Prince Andrew sighed with relief, smiled, and held out his hand.
 50289	
 50290	âYou?â he said. âHow fortunate!â
 50291	
 50292	With a rapid but careful movement NatÃ¡sha drew nearer to him on her
 50293	knees and, taking his hand carefully, bent her face over it and began
 50294	kissing it, just touching it lightly with her lips.
 50295	
 50296	âForgive me!â she whispered, raising her head and glancing at him.
 50297	âForgive me!â
 50298	
 50299	âI love you,â said Prince Andrew.
 50300	
 50301	âForgive...!â
 50302	
 50303	âForgive what?â he asked.
 50304	
 50305	âForgive me for what I ha-ve do-ne!â faltered NatÃ¡sha in a scarcely
 50306	audible, broken whisper, and began kissing his hand more rapidly, just
 50307	touching it with her lips.
 50308	
 50309	âI love you more, better than before,â said Prince Andrew, lifting her
 50310	face with his hand so as to look into her eyes.
 50311	
 50312	Those eyes, filled with happy tears, gazed at him timidly,
 50313	compassionately, and with joyous love. NatÃ¡shaâs thin pale face, with
 50314	its swollen lips, was more than plainâit was dreadful. But Prince Andrew
 50315	did not see that, he saw her shining eyes which were beautiful. They
 50316	heard the sound of voices behind them.
 50317	
 50318	Peter the valet, who was now wide awake, had roused the doctor.
 50319	TimÃ³khin, who had not slept at all because of the pain in his leg, had
 50320	long been watching all that was going on, carefully covering his bare
 50321	body with the sheet as he huddled up on his bench.
 50322	
 50323	âWhatâs this?â said the doctor, rising from his bed. âPlease go away,
 50324	madam!â
 50325	
 50326	At that moment a maid sent by the countess, who had noticed her
 50327	daughterâs absence, knocked at the door.
 50328	
 50329	Like a somnambulist aroused from her sleep NatÃ¡sha went out of the room
 50330	and, returning to her hut, fell sobbing on her bed.
 50331	
 50332	From that time, during all the rest of the RostÃ³vsâ journey, at every
 50333	halting place and wherever they spent a night, NatÃ¡sha never left the
 50334	wounded BolkÃ³nski, and the doctor had to admit that he had not expected
 50335	from a young girl either such firmness or such skill in nursing a
 50336	wounded man.
 50337	
 50338	Dreadful as the countess imagined it would be should Prince Andrew die
 50339	in her daughterâs arms during the journeyâas, judging by what the doctor
 50340	said, it seemed might easily happenâshe could not oppose NatÃ¡sha. Though
 50341	with the intimacy now established between the wounded man and NatÃ¡sha
 50342	the thought occurred that should he recover their former engagement
 50343	would be renewed, no oneâleast of all NatÃ¡sha and Prince Andrewâspoke of
 50344	this: the unsettled question of life and death, which hung not only over
 50345	BolkÃ³nski but over all Russia, shut out all other considerations.
 50346

 50351	CHAPTER XXXIII
 50352	
 50353	On the third of September Pierre awoke late. His head was aching, the
 50354	clothes in which he had slept without undressing felt uncomfortable on
 50355	his body, and his mind had a dim consciousness of something shameful
 50356	he had done the day before. That something shameful was his yesterdayâs
 50357	conversation with Captain Ramballe.
 50358	
 50359	It was eleven by the clock, but it seemed peculiarly dark out of doors.
 50360	Pierre rose, rubbed his eyes, and seeing the pistol with an engraved
 50361	stock which GerÃ¡sim had replaced on the writing table, he remembered
 50362	where he was and what lay before him that very day.
 50363	
 50364	âAm I not too late?â he thought. âNo, probably he wonât make his entry
 50365	into Moscow before noon.â
 50366	
 50367	Pierre did not allow himself to reflect on what lay before him, but
 50368	hastened to act.
 50369	
 50370	After arranging his clothes, he took the pistol and was about to go out.
 50371	But it then occurred to him for the first time that he certainly could
 50372	not carry the weapon in his hand through the streets. It was difficult
 50373	to hide such a big pistol even under his wide coat. He could not
 50374	carry it unnoticed in his belt or under his arm. Besides, it had been
 50375	discharged, and he had not had time to reload it. âNo matter, the dagger
 50376	will do,â he said to himself, though when planning his design he had
 50377	more than once come to the conclusion that the chief mistake made by the
 50378	student in 1809 had been to try to kill Napoleon with a dagger. But as
 50379	his chief aim consisted not in carrying out his design, but in proving
 50380	to himself that he would not abandon his intention and was doing all he
 50381	could to achieve it, Pierre hastily took the blunt jagged dagger in a
 50382	green sheath which he had bought at the SÃºkharev market with the pistol,
 50383	and hid it under his waistcoat.
 50384	
 50385	Having tied a girdle over his coat and pulled his cap low on his head,
 50386	Pierre went down the corridor, trying to avoid making a noise or meeting
 50387	the captain, and passed out into the street.
 50388	
 50389	The conflagration, at which he had looked with so much indifference the
 50390	evening before, had greatly increased during the night. Moscow was on
 50391	fire in several places. The buildings in Carriage Row, across the river,
 50392	in the Bazaar and the PovarskÃ³y, as well as the barges on the MoskvÃ¡
 50393	River and the timber yards by the DorogomÃ­lov Bridge, were all ablaze.
 50394	
 50395	Pierreâs way led through side streets to the PovarskÃ³y and from there
 50396	to the church of St. Nicholas on the ArbÃ¡t, where he had long before
 50397	decided that the deed should be done. The gates of most of the houses
 50398	were locked and the shutters up. The streets and lanes were deserted.
 50399	The air was full of smoke and the smell of burning. Now and then he met
 50400	Russians with anxious and timid faces, and Frenchmen with an air not of
 50401	the city but of the camp, walking in the middle of the streets. Both
 50402	the Russians and the French looked at Pierre with surprise. Besides his
 50403	height and stoutness, and the strange morose look of suffering in his
 50404	face and whole figure, the Russians stared at Pierre because they could
 50405	not make out to what class he could belong. The French followed him with
 50406	astonishment in their eyes chiefly because Pierre, unlike all the
 50407	other Russians who gazed at the French with fear and curiosity, paid no
 50408	attention to them. At the gate of one house three Frenchmen, who were
 50409	explaining something to some Russians who did not understand them,
 50410	stopped Pierre asking if he did not know French.
 50411	
 50412	Pierre shook his head and went on. In another side street a sentinel
 50413	standing beside a green caisson shouted at him, but only when the shout
 50414	was threateningly repeated and he heard the click of the manâs musket as
 50415	he raised it did Pierre understand that he had to pass on the other side
 50416	of the street. He heard nothing and saw nothing of what went on around
 50417	him. He carried his resolution within himself in terror and haste, like
 50418	something dreadful and alien to him, for, after the previous nightâs
 50419	experience, he was afraid of losing it. But he was not destined to bring
 50420	his mood safely to his destination. And even had he not been hindered by
 50421	anything on the way, his intention could not now have been carried out,
 50422	for Napoleon had passed the ArbÃ¡t more than four hours previously on his
 50423	way from the DorogomÃ­lov suburb to the KrÃ©mlin, and was now sitting in
 50424	a very gloomy frame of mind in a royal study in the KrÃ©mlin, giving
 50425	detailed and exact orders as to measures to be taken immediately
 50426	to extinguish the fire, to prevent looting, and to reassure the
 50427	inhabitants. But Pierre did not know this; he was entirely absorbed
 50428	in what lay before him, and was torturedâas those are who obstinately
 50429	undertake a task that is impossible for them not because of its
 50430	difficulty but because of its incompatibility with their naturesâby the
 50431	fear of weakening at the decisive moment and so losing his self-esteem.
 50432	
 50433	Though he heard and saw nothing around him he found his way by instinct
 50434	and did not go wrong in the side streets that led to the PovarskÃ³y.
 50435	
 50436	As Pierre approached that street the smoke became denser and denserâhe
 50437	even felt the heat of the fire. Occasionally curly tongues of flame rose
 50438	from under the roofs of the houses. He met more people in the streets
 50439	and they were more excited. But Pierre, though he felt that something
 50440	unusual was happening around him, did not realize that he was
 50441	approaching the fire. As he was going along a footpath across a
 50442	wide-open space adjoining the PovarskÃ³y on one side and the gardens
 50443	of Prince GruzÃ­nskiâs house on the other, Pierre suddenly heard the
 50444	desperate weeping of a woman close to him. He stopped as if awakening
 50445	from a dream and lifted his head.
 50446	
 50447	By the side of the path, on the dusty dry grass, all sorts of household
 50448	goods lay in a heap: featherbeds, a samovar, icons, and trunks. On the
 50449	ground, beside the trunks, sat a thin woman no longer young, with long,
 50450	prominent upper teeth, and wearing a black cloak and cap. This woman,
 50451	swaying to and fro and muttering something, was choking with sobs. Two
 50452	girls of about ten and twelve, dressed in dirty short frocks and cloaks,
 50453	were staring at their mother with a look of stupefaction on their pale
 50454	frightened faces. The youngest child, a boy of about seven, who wore an
 50455	overcoat and an immense cap evidently not his own, was crying in his
 50456	old nurseâs arms. A dirty, barefooted maid was sitting on a trunk,
 50457	and, having undone her pale-colored plait, was pulling it straight
 50458	and sniffing at her singed hair. The womanâs husband, a short,
 50459	round-shouldered man in the undress uniform of a civilian official, with
 50460	sausage-shaped whiskers and showing under his square-set cap the hair
 50461	smoothly brushed forward over his temples, with expressionless face was
 50462	moving the trunks, which were placed one on another, and was dragging
 50463	some garments from under them.
 50464	
 50465	As soon as she saw Pierre, the woman almost threw herself at his feet.
 50466	
 50467	âDear people, good Christians, save me, help me, dear friends... help
 50468	us, somebody,â she muttered between her sobs. âMy girl... My daughter!
 50469	My youngest daughter is left behind. Sheâs burned! Ooh! Was it for this
 50470	I nursed you.... Ooh!â
 50471	
 50472	âDonât, Mary NikolÃ¡evna!â said her husband to her in a low voice,
 50473	evidently only to justify himself before the stranger. âSister must have
 50474	taken her, or else where can she be?â he added.
 50475	
 50476	âMonster! Villain!â shouted the woman angrily, suddenly ceasing to weep.
 50477	âYou have no heart, you donât feel for your own child! Another man would
 50478	have rescued her from the fire. But this is a monster and neither a
 50479	man nor a father! You, honored sir, are a noble man,â she went on,
 50480	addressing Pierre rapidly between her sobs. âThe fire broke out
 50481	alongside, and blew our way, the maid called out âFire!â and we rushed
 50482	to collect our things. We ran out just as we were.... This is what we
 50483	have brought away.... The icons, and my dowry bed, all the rest is lost.
 50484	We seized the children. But not Katie! Ooh! O Lord!...â and again she
 50485	began to sob. âMy child, my dear one! Burned, burned!â
 50486	
 50487	âBut where was she left?â asked Pierre.
 50488	
 50489	From the expression of his animated face the woman saw that this man
 50490	might help her.
 50491	
 50492	âOh, dear sir!â she cried, seizing him by the legs. âMy benefactor, set
 50493	my heart at ease.... AnÃ­ska, go, you horrid girl, show him the way!â she
 50494	cried to the maid, angrily opening her mouth and still farther exposing
 50495	her long teeth.
 50496	
 50497	âShow me the way, show me, I... Iâll do it,â gasped Pierre rapidly.
 50498	
 50499	The dirty maidservant stepped from behind the trunk, put up her plait,
 50500	sighed, and went on her short, bare feet along the path. Pierre felt
 50501	as if he had come back to life after a heavy swoon. He held his head
 50502	higher, his eyes shone with the light of life, and with swift steps
 50503	he followed the maid, overtook her, and came out on the PovarskÃ³y. The
 50504	whole street was full of clouds of black smoke. Tongues of flame here
 50505	and there broke through that cloud. A great number of people crowded in
 50506	front of the conflagration. In the middle of the street stood a French
 50507	general saying something to those around him. Pierre, accompanied by the
 50508	maid, was advancing to the spot where the general stood, but the French
 50509	soldiers stopped him.
 50510	
 50511	âOn ne passe pas!â * cried a voice.
 50512	
 50513	    * âYou canât pass!â
 50514	
 50515	
 50516	âThis way, uncle,â cried the girl. âWeâll pass through the side street,
 50517	by the NikÃºlinsâ!â
 50518	
 50519	Pierre turned back, giving a spring now and then to keep up with her.
 50520	She ran across the street, turned down a side street to the left, and,
 50521	passing three houses, turned into a yard on the right.
 50522	
 50523	âItâs here, close by,â said she and, running across the yard, opened a
 50524	gate in a wooden fence and, stopping, pointed out to him a small wooden
 50525	wing of the house, which was burning brightly and fiercely. One of its
 50526	sides had fallen in, another was on fire, and bright flames issued from
 50527	the openings of the windows and from under the roof.
 50528	
 50529	As Pierre passed through the fence gate, he was enveloped by hot air and
 50530	involuntarily stopped.
 50531	
 50532	âWhich is it? Which is your house?â he asked.
 50533	
 50534	âOoh!â wailed the girl, pointing to the wing. âThatâs it, that was our
 50535	lodging. Youâve burned to death, our treasure, Katie, my precious little
 50536	missy! Ooh!â lamented AnÃ­ska, who at the sight of the fire felt that she
 50537	too must give expression to her feelings.
 50538	
 50539	Pierre rushed to the wing, but the heat was so great that he
 50540	involuntarily passed round in a curve and came upon the large house
 50541	that was as yet burning only at one end, just below the roof, and around
 50542	which swarmed a crowd of Frenchmen. At first Pierre did not realize
 50543	what these men, who were dragging something out, were about; but seeing
 50544	before him a Frenchman hitting a peasant with a blunt saber and trying
 50545	to take from him a fox-fur coat, he vaguely understood that looting was
 50546	going on there, but he had no time to dwell on that idea.
 50547	
 50548	The sounds of crackling and the din of falling walls and ceilings, the
 50549	whistle and hiss of the flames, the excited shouts of the people, and
 50550	the sight of the swaying smoke, now gathering into thick black clouds
 50551	and now soaring up with glittering sparks, with here and there dense
 50552	sheaves of flame (now red and now like golden fish scales creeping along
 50553	the walls), and the heat and smoke and rapidity of motion, produced
 50554	on Pierre the usual animating effects of a conflagration. It had a
 50555	peculiarly strong effect on him because at the sight of the fire he felt
 50556	himself suddenly freed from the ideas that had weighed him down. He felt
 50557	young, bright, adroit, and resolute. He ran round to the other side of
 50558	the lodge and was about to dash into that part of it which was still
 50559	standing, when just above his head he heard several voices shouting
 50560	and then a cracking sound and the ring of something heavy falling close
 50561	beside him.
 50562	
 50563	Pierre looked up and saw at a window of the large house some Frenchmen
 50564	who had just thrown out the drawer of a chest, filled with metal
 50565	articles. Other French soldiers standing below went up to the drawer.
 50566	
 50567	âWhat does this fellow want?â shouted one of them referring to Pierre.
 50568	
 50569	âThereâs a child in that house. Havenât you seen a child?â cried Pierre.
 50570	
 50571	âWhatâs he talking about? Get along!â said several voices, and one of
 50572	the soldiers, evidently afraid that Pierre might want to take from
 50573	them some of the plate and bronzes that were in the drawer, moved
 50574	threateningly toward him.
 50575	
 50576	âA child?â shouted a Frenchman from above. âI did hear something
 50577	squealing in the garden. Perhaps itâs his brat that the fellow is
 50578	looking for. After all, one must be human, you know....â
 50579	
 50580	âWhere is it? Where?â said Pierre.
 50581	
 50582	âThere! There!â shouted the Frenchman at the window, pointing to the
 50583	garden at the back of the house. âWait a bitâIâm coming down.â
 50584	
 50585	And a minute or two later the Frenchman, a black-eyed fellow with a spot
 50586	on his cheek, in shirt sleeves, really did jump out of a window on the
 50587	ground floor, and clapping Pierre on the shoulder ran with him into the
 50588	garden.
 50589	
 50590	âHurry up, you others!â he called out to his comrades. âItâs getting
 50591	hot.â
 50592	
 50593	When they reached a gravel path behind the house the Frenchman pulled
 50594	Pierre by the arm and pointed to a round, graveled space where a
 50595	three-year-old girl in a pink dress was lying under a seat.
 50596	
 50597	âThere is your child! Oh, a girl, so much the better!â said the
 50598	Frenchman. âGood-by, Fatty. We must be human, we are all mortal you
 50599	know!â and the Frenchman with the spot on his cheek ran back to his
 50600	comrades.
 50601	
 50602	Breathless with joy, Pierre ran to the little girl and was going to take
 50603	her in his arms. But seeing a stranger the sickly, scrofulous-looking
 50604	child, unattractively like her mother, began to yell and run away.
 50605	Pierre, however, seized her and lifted her in his arms. She screamed
 50606	desperately and angrily and tried with her little hands to pull Pierreâs
 50607	hands away and to bite them with her slobbering mouth. Pierre was seized
 50608	by a sense of horror and repulsion such as he had experienced when
 50609	touching some nasty little animal. But he made an effort not to throw
 50610	the child down and ran with her to the large house. It was now, however,
 50611	impossible to get back the way he had come; the maid, AnÃ­ska, was no
 50612	longer there, and Pierre with a feeling of pity and disgust pressed the
 50613	wet, painfully sobbing child to himself as tenderly as he could and ran
 50614	with her through the garden seeking another way out.
 50615	
 50616

 50620	CHAPTER XXXIV

 50622	Having run through different yards and side streets, Pierre got back
 50623	with his little burden to the GruzÃ­nski garden at the corner of the
 50624	PovarskÃ³y. He did not at first recognize the place from which he had set
 50625	out to look for the child, so crowded was it now with people and goods
 50626	that had been dragged out of the houses. Besides Russian families who
 50627	had taken refuge here from the fire with their belongings, there were
 50628	several French soldiers in a variety of clothing. Pierre took no notice
 50629	of them. He hurried to find the family of that civil servant in order to
 50630	restore the daughter to her mother and go to save someone else. Pierre
 50631	felt that he had still much to do and to do quickly. Glowing with the
 50632	heat and from running, he felt at that moment more strongly than ever
 50633	the sense of youth, animation, and determination that had come on him
 50634	when he ran to save the child. She had now become quiet and, clinging
 50635	with her little hands to Pierreâs coat, sat on his arm gazing about
 50636	her like some little wild animal. He glanced at her occasionally with a
 50637	slight smile. He fancied he saw something pathetically innocent in that
 50638	frightened, sickly little face.
 50639	
 50640	He did not find the civil servant or his wife where he had left them. He
 50641	walked among the crowd with rapid steps, scanning the various faces he
 50642	met. Involuntarily he noticed a Georgian or Armenian family
 50643	consisting of a very handsome old man of Oriental type, wearing a new,
 50644	cloth-covered, sheepskin coat and new boots, an old woman of similar
 50645	type, and a young woman. That very young woman seemed to Pierre the
 50646	perfection of Oriental beauty, with her sharply outlined, arched,
 50647	black eyebrows and the extraordinarily soft, bright color of her long,
 50648	beautiful, expressionless face. Amid the scattered property and the
 50649	crowd on the open space, she, in her rich satin cloak with a bright
 50650	lilac shawl on her head, suggested a delicate exotic plant thrown out
 50651	onto the snow. She was sitting on some bundles a little behind the old
 50652	woman, and looked from under her long lashes with motionless, large,
 50653	almond-shaped eyes at the ground before her. Evidently she was aware
 50654	of her beauty and fearful because of it. Her face struck Pierre and,
 50655	hurrying along by the fence, he turned several times to look at her.
 50656	When he had reached the fence, still without finding those he sought, he
 50657	stopped and looked about him.
 50658	
 50659	With the child in his arms his figure was now more conspicuous than
 50660	before, and a group of Russians, both men and women, gathered about him.
 50661	
 50662	âHave you lost anyone, my dear fellow? Youâre of the gentry yourself,
 50663	arenât you? Whose child is it?â they asked him.
 50664	
 50665	Pierre replied that the child belonged to a woman in a black coat who
 50666	had been sitting there with her other children, and he asked whether
 50667	anyone knew where she had gone.
 50668	
 50669	âWhy, that must be the AnfÃ©rovs,â said an old deacon, addressing a
 50670	pockmarked peasant woman. âLord have mercy, Lord have mercy!â he added
 50671	in his customary bass.
 50672	
 50673	âThe AnfÃ©rovs? No,â said the woman. âThey left in the morning. That must
 50674	be either Mary NikolÃ¡evnaâs or the IvÃ¡novsâ!â
 50675	
 50676	âHe says âa woman,â and Mary NikolÃ¡evna is a lady,â remarked a house
 50677	serf.
 50678	
 50679	âDo you know her? Sheâs thin, with long teeth,â said Pierre.
 50680	
 50681	âThatâs Mary NikolÃ¡evna! They went inside the garden when these wolves
 50682	swooped down,â said the woman, pointing to the French soldiers.
 50683	
 50684	âO Lord, have mercy!â added the deacon.
 50685	
 50686	âGo over that way, theyâre there. Itâs she! She kept on lamenting and
 50687	crying,â continued the woman. âItâs she. Here, this way!â
 50688	
 50689	But Pierre was not listening to the woman. He had for some seconds been
 50690	intently watching what was going on a few steps away. He was looking at
 50691	the Armenian family and at two French soldiers who had gone up to them.
 50692	One of these, a nimble little man, was wearing a blue coat tied round
 50693	the waist with a rope. He had a nightcap on his head and his feet were
 50694	bare. The other, whose appearance particularly struck Pierre, was a
 50695	long, lank, round-shouldered, fair-haired man, slow in his movements
 50696	and with an idiotic expression of face. He wore a womanâs loose gown
 50697	of frieze, blue trousers, and large torn Hessian boots. The little
 50698	barefooted Frenchman in the blue coat went up to the Armenians and,
 50699	saying something, immediately seized the old man by his legs and the old
 50700	man at once began pulling off his boots. The other in the frieze gown
 50701	stopped in front of the beautiful Armenian girl and with his hands in
 50702	his pockets stood staring at her, motionless and silent.
 50703	
 50704	âHere, take the child!â said Pierre peremptorily and hurriedly to the
 50705	woman, handing the little girl to her. âGive her back to them, give her
 50706	back!â he almost shouted, putting the child, who began screaming, on the
 50707	ground, and again looking at the Frenchman and the Armenian family.
 50708	
 50709	The old man was already sitting barefoot. The little Frenchman had
 50710	secured his second boot and was slapping one boot against the other.
 50711	The old man was saying something in a voice broken by sobs, but Pierre
 50712	caught but a glimpse of this, his whole attention was directed to the
 50713	Frenchman in the frieze gown who meanwhile, swaying slowly from side to
 50714	side, had drawn nearer to the young woman and taking his hands from his
 50715	pockets had seized her by the neck.
 50716	
 50717	The beautiful Armenian still sat motionless and in the same attitude,
 50718	with her long lashes drooping as if she did not see or feel what the
 50719	soldier was doing to her.
 50720	
 50721	While Pierre was running the few steps that separated him from the
 50722	Frenchman, the tall marauder in the frieze gown was already tearing
 50723	from her neck the necklace the young Armenian was wearing, and the young
 50724	woman, clutching at her neck, screamed piercingly.
 50725	
 50726	âLet that woman alone!â exclaimed Pierre hoarsely in a furious voice,
 50727	seizing the soldier by his round shoulders and throwing him aside.
 50728	
 50729	The soldier fell, got up, and ran away. But his comrade, throwing down
 50730	the boots and drawing his sword, moved threateningly toward Pierre.
 50731	
 50732	âVoyons, pas de bÃªtises!â * he cried.
 50733	
 50734	    * âLook here, no nonsense!â
 50735	
 50736	
 50737	Pierre was in such a transport of rage that he remembered nothing and
 50738	his strength increased tenfold. He rushed at the barefooted Frenchman
 50739	and, before the latter had time to draw his sword, knocked him off his
 50740	feet and hammered him with his fists. Shouts of approval were heard
 50741	from the crowd around, and at the same moment a mounted patrol of French
 50742	Uhlans appeared from round the corner. The Uhlans came up at a trot to
 50743	Pierre and the Frenchman and surrounded them. Pierre remembered nothing
 50744	of what happened after that. He only remembered beating someone and
 50745	being beaten and finally feeling that his hands were bound and that a
 50746	crowd of French soldiers stood around him and were searching him.
 50747	
 50748	âLieutenant, he has a dagger,â were the first words Pierre understood.
 50749	
 50750	âAh, a weapon?â said the officer and turned to the barefooted soldier
 50751	who had been arrested with Pierre. âAll right, you can tell all about it
 50752	at the court-martial.â Then he turned to Pierre. âDo you speak French?â
 50753	
 50754	Pierre looked around him with bloodshot eyes and did not reply. His
 50755	face probably looked very terrible, for the officer said something in
 50756	a whisper and four more Uhlans left the ranks and placed themselves on
 50757	both sides of Pierre.
 50758	
 50759	âDo you speak French?â the officer asked again, keeping at a distance
 50760	from Pierre. âCall the interpreter.â
 50761	
 50762	A little man in Russian civilian clothes rode out from the ranks, and
 50763	by his clothes and manner of speaking Pierre at once knew him to be a
 50764	French salesman from one of the Moscow shops.
 50765	
 50766	âHe does not look like a common man,â said the interpreter, after a
 50767	searching look at Pierre.
 50768	
 50769	âAh, he looks very much like an incendiary,â remarked the officer. âAnd
 50770	ask him who he is,â he added.
 50771	
 50772	âWho are you?â asked the interpreter in poor Russian. âYou must answer
 50773	the chief.â
 50774	
 50775	âI will not tell you who I am. I am your prisonerâtake me!â Pierre
 50776	suddenly replied in French.
 50777	
 50778	âAh, ah!â muttered the officer with a frown. âWell then, march!â
 50779	
 50780	A crowd had collected round the Uhlans. Nearest to Pierre stood the
 50781	pockmarked peasant woman with the little girl, and when the patrol
 50782	started she moved forward.
 50783	
 50784	âWhere are they taking you to, you poor dear?â said she. âAnd the little
 50785	girl, the little girl, what am I to do with her if sheâs not theirs?â
 50786	said the woman.
 50787	
 50788	âWhat does that woman want?â asked the officer.
 50789	
 50790	Pierre was as if intoxicated. His elation increased at the sight of the
 50791	little girl he had saved.
 50792	
 50793	âWhat does she want?â he murmured. âShe is bringing me my daughter whom
 50794	I have just saved from the flames,â said he. âGood-by!â And without
 50795	knowing how this aimless lie had escaped him, he went along with
 50796	resolute and triumphant steps between the French soldiers.
 50797	
 50798	The French patrol was one of those sent out through the various
 50799	streets of Moscow by Durosnelâs order to put a stop to the pillage,
 50800	and especially to catch the incendiaries who, according to the general
 50801	opinion which had that day originated among the higher French officers,
 50802	were the cause of the conflagrations. After marching through a number
 50803	of streets the patrol arrested five more Russian suspects: a small
 50804	shopkeeper, two seminary students, a peasant, and a house serf, besides
 50805	several looters. But of all these various suspected characters, Pierre
 50806	was considered to be the most suspicious of all. When they had all been
 50807	brought for the night to a large house on the ZÃºbov Rampart that was
 50808	being used as a guardhouse, Pierre was placed apart under strict guard.

 50820	CHAPTER I
 50821	
 50822	In Petersburg at that time a complicated struggle was being carried on
 50823	with greater heat than ever in the highest circles, between the parties
 50824	of RumyÃ¡ntsev, the French, MÃ¡rya FÃ«dorovna, the TsarÃ©vich, and others,
 50825	drowned as usual by the buzzing of the court drones. But the calm,
 50826	luxurious life of Petersburg, concerned only about phantoms and
 50827	reflections of real life, went on in its old way and made it hard,
 50828	except by a great effort, to realize the danger and the difficult
 50829	position of the Russian people. There were the same receptions and
 50830	balls, the same French theater, the same court interests and service
 50831	interests and intrigues as usual. Only in the very highest circles were
 50832	attempts made to keep in mind the difficulties of the actual position.
 50833	Stories were whispered of how differently the two Empresses behaved
 50834	in these difficult circumstances. The Empress MÃ¡rya, concerned for
 50835	the welfare of the charitable and educational institutions under her
 50836	patronage, had given directions that they should all be removed to
 50837	KazÃ¡n, and the things belonging to these institutions had already been
 50838	packed up. The Empress Elisabeth, however, when asked what instructions
 50839	she would be pleased to giveâwith her characteristic Russian patriotism
 50840	had replied that she could give no directions about state institutions
 50841	for that was the affair of the sovereign, but as far as she personally
 50842	was concerned she would be the last to quit Petersburg.
 50843	
 50844	At Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs on the twenty-sixth of August, the very day of the
 50845	battle of BorodinÃ³, there was a soiree, the chief feature of which was
 50846	to be the reading of a letter from His Lordship the Bishop when sending
 50847	the Emperor an icon of the Venerable Sergius. It was regarded as a model
 50848	of ecclesiastical, patriotic eloquence. Prince VasÃ­li himself, famed for
 50849	his elocution, was to read it. (He used to read at the Empressâ.) The
 50850	art of his reading was supposed to lie in rolling out the words, quite
 50851	independently of their meaning, in a loud and singsong voice alternating
 50852	between a despairing wail and a tender murmur, so that the wail fell
 50853	quite at random on one word and the murmur on another. This reading,
 50854	as was always the case at Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs soirees, had a political
 50855	significance. That evening she expected several important personages who
 50856	had to be made ashamed of their visits to the French theater and aroused
 50857	to a patriotic temper. A good many people had already arrived, but Anna
 50858	PÃ¡vlovna, not yet seeing all those whom she wanted in her drawing room,
 50859	did not let the reading begin but wound up the springs of a general
 50860	conversation.
 50861	
 50862	The news of the day in Petersburg was the illness of Countess BezÃºkhova.
 50863	She had fallen ill unexpectedly a few days previously, had missed
 50864	several gatherings of which she was usually the ornament, and was said
 50865	to be receiving no one, and instead of the celebrated Petersburg doctors
 50866	who usually attended her had entrusted herself to some Italian doctor
 50867	who was treating her in some new and unusual way.
 50868	
 50869	They all knew very well that the enchanting countessâ illness arose from
 50870	an inconvenience resulting from marrying two husbands at the same time,
 50871	and that the Italianâs cure consisted in removing such inconvenience;
 50872	but in Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs presence no one dared to think of this or even
 50873	appear to know it.
 50874	
 50875	âThey say the poor countess is very ill. The doctor says it is angina
 50876	pectoris.â
 50877	
 50878	âAngina? Oh, thatâs a terrible illness!â
 50879	
 50880	âThey say that the rivals are reconciled, thanks to the angina...â and
 50881	the word angina was repeated with great satisfaction.
 50882	
 50883	âThe count is pathetic, they say. He cried like a child when the doctor
 50884	told him the case was dangerous.â
 50885	
 50886	âOh, it would be a terrible loss, she is an enchanting woman.â
 50887	
 50888	âYou are speaking of the poor countess?â said Anna PÃ¡vlovna, coming
 50889	up just then. âI sent to ask for news, and hear that she is a little
 50890	better. Oh, she is certainly the most charming woman in the world,â she
 50891	went on, with a smile at her own enthusiasm. âWe belong to different
 50892	camps, but that does not prevent my esteeming her as she deserves. She
 50893	is very unfortunate!â added Anna PÃ¡vlovna.
 50894	
 50895	Supposing that by these words Anna PÃ¡vlovna was somewhat lifting the
 50896	veil from the secret of the countessâ malady, an unwary young man
 50897	ventured to express surprise that well-known doctors had not been called
 50898	in and that the countess was being attended by a charlatan who might
 50899	employ dangerous remedies.
 50900	
 50901	âYour information may be better than mine,â Anna PÃ¡vlovna suddenly and
 50902	venomously retorted on the inexperienced young man, âbut I know on good
 50903	authority that this doctor is a very learned and able man. He is private
 50904	physician to the Queen of Spain.â
 50905	
 50906	And having thus demolished the young man, Anna PÃ¡vlovna turned to
 50907	another group where BilÃ­bin was talking about the Austrians: having
 50908	wrinkled up his face he was evidently preparing to smooth it out again
 50909	and utter one of his mots.
 50910	
 50911	âI think it is delightful,â he said, referring to a diplomatic note that
 50912	had been sent to Vienna with some Austrian banners captured from the
 50913	French by Wittgenstein, âthe hero of Petropolâ as he was then called in
 50914	Petersburg.
 50915	
 50916	âWhat? Whatâs that?â asked Anna PÃ¡vlovna, securing silence for the mot,
 50917	which she had heard before.
 50918	
 50919	And BilÃ­bin repeated the actual words of the diplomatic dispatch, which
 50920	he had himself composed.
 50921	
 50922	âThe Emperor returns these Austrian banners,â said BilÃ­bin, âfriendly
 50923	banners gone astray and found on a wrong path,â and his brow became
 50924	smooth again.
 50925	
 50926	âCharming, charming!â observed Prince VasÃ­li.
 50927	
 50928	âThe path to Warsaw, perhaps,â Prince Hippolyte remarked loudly and
 50929	unexpectedly. Everybody looked at him, understanding what he meant.
 50930	Prince Hippolyte himself glanced around with amused surprise. He knew no
 50931	more than the others what his words meant. During his diplomatic career
 50932	he had more than once noticed that such utterances were received as very
 50933	witty, and at every opportunity he uttered in that way the first words
 50934	that entered his head. âIt may turn out very well,â he thought, âbut
 50935	if not, theyâll know how to arrange matters.â And really, during the
 50936	awkward silence that ensued, that insufficiently patriotic person
 50937	entered whom Anna PÃ¡vlovna had been waiting for and wished to convert,
 50938	and she, smiling and shaking a finger at Hippolyte, invited Prince
 50939	VasÃ­li to the table and bringing him two candles and the manuscript
 50940	begged him to begin. Everyone became silent.
 50941	
 50942	âMost Gracious Sovereign and Emperor!â Prince VasÃ­li sternly declaimed,
 50943	looking round at his audience as if to inquire whether anyone had
 50944	anything to say to the contrary. But no one said anything. âMoscow, our
 50945	ancient capital, the New Jerusalem, receives her Christââhe placed a
 50946	sudden emphasis on the word herââas a mother receives her zealous sons
 50947	into her arms, and through the gathering mists, foreseeing the brilliant
 50948	glory of thy rule, sings in exultation, âHosanna, blessed is he that
 50949	cometh!ââ
 50950	
 50951	Prince VasÃ­li pronounced these last words in a tearful voice.
 50952	
 50953	BilÃ­bin attentively examined his nails, and many of those present
 50954	appeared intimidated, as if asking in what they were to blame. Anna
 50955	PÃ¡vlovna whispered the next words in advance, like an old woman
 50956	muttering the prayer at Communion: âLet the bold and insolent
 50957	Goliath...â she whispered.
 50958	
 50959	Prince VasÃ­li continued.
 50960	
 50961	âLet the bold and insolent Goliath from the borders of France encompass
 50962	the realms of Russia with death-bearing terrors; humble Faith, the sling
 50963	of the Russian David, shall suddenly smite his head in his bloodthirsty
 50964	pride. This icon of the Venerable Sergius, the servant of God and
 50965	zealous champion of old of our countryâs weal, is offered to Your
 50966	Imperial Majesty. I grieve that my waning strength prevents rejoicing
 50967	in the sight of your most gracious presence. I raise fervent prayers to
 50968	Heaven that the Almighty may exalt the race of the just, and mercifully
 50969	fulfill the desires of Your Majesty.â
 50970	
 50971	âWhat force! What a style!â was uttered in approval both of reader and
 50972	of author.
 50973	
 50974	Animated by that address Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs guests talked for a long time
 50975	of the state of the fatherland and offered various conjectures as to the
 50976	result of the battle to be fought in a few days.
 50977	
 50978	âYou will see,â said Anna PÃ¡vlovna, âthat tomorrow, on the Emperorâs
 50979	birthday, we shall receive news. I have a favorable presentiment!â
 50980	
 50981	
 50982	
 50983	
 50984	
 50985	CHAPTER II
 50986	
 50987	Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs presentiment was in fact fulfilled. Next day during the
 50988	service at the palace church in honor of the Emperorâs birthday, Prince
 50989	VolkÃ³nski was called out of the church and received a dispatch from
 50990	Prince KutÃºzov. It was KutÃºzovâs report, written from TatÃ¡rinova on the
 50991	day of the battle. KutÃºzov wrote that the Russians had not retreated a
 50992	step, that the French losses were much heavier than ours, and that he
 50993	was writing in haste from the field of battle before collecting full
 50994	information. It followed that there must have been a victory. And at
 50995	once, without leaving the church, thanks were rendered to the Creator
 50996	for His help and for the victory.
 50997	
 50998	Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs presentiment was justified, and all that morning a
 50999	joyously festive mood reigned in the city. Everyone believed the victory
 51000	to have been complete, and some even spoke of Napoleonâs having been
 51001	captured, of his deposition, and of the choice of a new ruler for
 51002	France.
 51003	
 51004	It is very difficult for events to be reflected in their real strength
 51005	and completeness amid the conditions of court life and far from the
 51006	scene of action. General events involuntarily group themselves around
 51007	some particular incident. So now the courtiersâ pleasure was based as
 51008	much on the fact that the news had arrived on the Emperorâs birthday as
 51009	on the fact of the victory itself. It was like a successfully arranged
 51010	surprise. Mention was made in KutÃºzovâs report of the Russian losses,
 51011	among which figured the names of TÃºchkov, BagratiÃ³n, and KutÃ¡ysov. In
 51012	the Petersburg world this sad side of the affair again involuntarily
 51013	centered round a single incident: KutÃ¡ysovâs death. Everybody knew
 51014	him, the Emperor liked him, and he was young and interesting. That day
 51015	everyone met with the words:
 51016	
 51017	âWhat a wonderful coincidence! Just during the service. But what a loss
 51018	KutÃ¡ysov is! How sorry I am!â
 51019	
 51020	âWhat did I tell about KutÃºzov?â Prince VasÃ­li now said with a
 51021	prophetâs pride. âI always said he was the only man capable of defeating
 51022	Napoleon.â
 51023	
 51024	But next day no news arrived from the army and the public mood grew
 51025	anxious. The courtiers suffered because of the suffering the suspense
 51026	occasioned the Emperor.
 51027	
 51028	âFancy the Emperorâs position!â said they, and instead of extolling
 51029	KutÃºzov as they had done the day before, they condemned him as the cause
 51030	of the Emperorâs anxiety. That day Prince VasÃ­li no longer boasted of
 51031	his protÃ©gÃ© KutÃºzov, but remained silent when the commander in chief was
 51032	mentioned. Moreover, toward evening, as if everything conspired to make
 51033	Petersburg society anxious and uneasy, a terrible piece of news was
 51034	added. Countess HÃ©lÃ¨ne BezÃºkhova had suddenly died of that terrible
 51035	malady it had been so agreeable to mention. Officially, at large
 51036	gatherings, everyone said that Countess BezÃºkhova had died of a
 51037	terrible attack of angina pectoris, but in intimate circles details
 51038	were mentioned of how the private physician of the Queen of Spain had
 51039	prescribed small doses of a certain drug to produce a certain effect;
 51040	but HÃ©lÃ¨ne, tortured by the fact that the old count suspected her and
 51041	that her husband to whom she had written (that wretched, profligate
 51042	Pierre) had not replied, had suddenly taken a very large dose of the
 51043	drug, and had died in agony before assistance could be rendered her.
 51044	It was said that Prince VasÃ­li and the old count had turned upon the
 51045	Italian, but the latter had produced such letters from the unfortunate
 51046	deceased that they had immediately let the matter drop.
 51047	
 51048	Talk in general centered round three melancholy facts: the Emperorâs
 51049	lack of news, the loss of KutÃ¡ysov, and the death of HÃ©lÃ¨ne.
 51050	
 51051	On the third day after KutÃºzovâs report a country gentleman arrived from
 51052	Moscow, and news of the surrender of Moscow to the French spread through
 51053	the whole town. This was terrible! What a position for the Emperor to
 51054	be in! KutÃºzov was a traitor, and Prince VasÃ­li during the visits of
 51055	condolence paid to him on the occasion of his daughterâs death said of
 51056	KutÃºzov, whom he had formerly praised (it was excusable for him in his
 51057	grief to forget what he had said), that it was impossible to expect
 51058	anything else from a blind and depraved old man.
 51059	
 51060	âI only wonder that the fate of Russia could have been entrusted to such
 51061	a man.â
 51062	
 51063	As long as this news remained unofficial it was possible to doubt it,
 51064	but the next day the following communication was received from Count
 51065	RostopchÃ­n:
 51066	
 51067	Prince KutÃºzovâs adjutant has brought me a letter in which he demands
 51068	police officers to guide the army to the RyazÃ¡n road. He writes that
 51069	he is regretfully abandoning Moscow. Sire! KutÃºzovâs action decides the
 51070	fate of the capital and of your empire! Russia will shudder to learn of
 51071	the abandonment of the city in which her greatness is centered and in
 51072	which lie the ashes of your ancestors! I shall follow the army. I have
 51073	had everything removed, and it only remains for me to weep over the fate
 51074	of my fatherland.
 51075	
 51076	On receiving this dispatch the Emperor sent Prince VolkÃ³nski to KutÃºzov
 51077	with the following rescript:
 51078	
 51079	Prince Michael IlariÃ³novich! Since the twenty-ninth of August I have
 51080	received no communication from you, yet on the first of September I
 51081	received from the commander in chief of Moscow, via YaroslÃ¡vl, the sad
 51082	news that you, with the army, have decided to abandon Moscow. You can
 51083	yourself imagine the effect this news has had on me, and your silence
 51084	increases my astonishment. I am sending this by Adjutant-General Prince
 51085	VolkÃ³nski, to hear from you the situation of the army and the reasons
 51086	that have induced you to take this melancholy decision.
 51087	
 51088	
 51089	
 51090	
 51091	
 51092	CHAPTER III
 51093	
 51094	Nine days after the abandonment of Moscow, a messenger from KutÃºzov
 51095	reached Petersburg with the official announcement of that event. This
 51096	messenger was Michaud, a Frenchman who did not know Russian, but who was
 51097	quoique Ã©tranger, russe de cÅur et dâÃ¢me, * as he said of himself.
 51098	
 51099	    * Though a foreigner, Russian in heart and soul.
 51100	
 51101	The Emperor at once received this messenger in his study at the palace
 51102	on Stone Island. Michaud, who had never seen Moscow before the campaign
 51103	and who did not know Russian, yet felt deeply moved (as he wrote) when
 51104	he appeared before notre trÃ¨s gracieux souverain * with the news of the
 51105	burning of Moscow, dont les flammes Ã©clairaient sa route. *(2)
 51106	
 51107	     * Our most gracious sovereign.
 51108	
 51109	     * (2) Whose flames illumined his route.
 51110	
 51111	Though the source of M. Michaudâs chagrin must have been different from
 51112	that which caused Russians to grieve, he had such a sad face when shown
 51113	into the Emperorâs study that the latter at once asked:
 51114	
 51115	âHave you brought me sad news, Colonel?â
 51116	
 51117	âVery sad, sire,â replied Michaud, lowering his eyes with a sigh. âThe
 51118	abandonment of Moscow.â
 51119	
 51120	âHave they surrendered my ancient capital without a battle?â asked the
 51121	Emperor quickly, his face suddenly flushing.
 51122	
 51123	Michaud respectfully delivered the message KutÃºzov had entrusted to him,
 51124	which was that it had been impossible to fight before Moscow, and that
 51125	as the only remaining choice was between losing the army as well as
 51126	Moscow, or losing Moscow alone, the field marshal had to choose the
 51127	latter.
 51128	
 51129	The Emperor listened in silence, not looking at Michaud.
 51130	
 51131	âHas the enemy entered the city?â he asked.
 51132	
 51133	âYes, sire, and Moscow is now in ashes. I left it all in flames,â
 51134	replied Michaud in a decided tone, but glancing at the Emperor he was
 51135	frightened by what he had done.
 51136	
 51137	The Emperor began to breathe heavily and rapidly, his lower lip
 51138	trembled, and tears instantly appeared in his fine blue eyes.
 51139	
 51140	But this lasted only a moment. He suddenly frowned, as if blaming
 51141	himself for his weakness, and raising his head addressed Michaud in a
 51142	firm voice:
 51143	
 51144	âI see, Colonel, from all that is happening, that Providence requires
 51145	great sacrifices of us... I am ready to submit myself in all things to
 51146	His will; but tell me, Michaud, how did you leave the army when it
 51147	saw my ancient capital abandoned without a battle? Did you not notice
 51148	discouragement?...â
 51149	
 51150	Seeing that his most gracious ruler was calm once more, Michaud also
 51151	grew calm, but was not immediately ready to reply to the Emperorâs
 51152	direct and relevant question which required a direct answer.
 51153	
 51154	âSire, will you allow me to speak frankly as befits a loyal soldier?â he
 51155	asked to gain time.
 51156	
 51157	âColonel, I always require it,â replied the Emperor. âConceal nothing
 51158	from me, I wish to know absolutely how things are.â
 51159	
 51160	âSire!â said Michaud with a subtle, scarcely perceptible smile on his
 51161	lips, having now prepared a well-phrased reply, âsire, I left the
 51162	whole army, from its chiefs to the lowest soldier, without exception in
 51163	desperate and agonized terror...â
 51164	
 51165	âHow is that?â the Emperor interrupted him, frowning sternly. âWould
 51166	misfortune make my Russians lose heart?... Never!â
 51167	
 51168	Michaud had only waited for this to bring out the phrase he had
 51169	prepared.
 51170	
 51171	âSire,â he said, with respectful playfulness, âthey are only afraid lest
 51172	Your Majesty, in the goodness of your heart, should allow yourself to be
 51173	persuaded to make peace. They are burning for the combat,â declared this
 51174	representative of the Russian nation, âand to prove to Your Majesty by
 51175	the sacrifice of their lives how devoted they are....â
 51176	
 51177	âAh!â said the Emperor reassured, and with a kindly gleam in his eyes,
 51178	he patted Michaud on the shoulder. âYou set me at ease, Colonel.â
 51179	
 51180	He bent his head and was silent for some time.
 51181	
 51182	âWell, then, go back to the army,â he said, drawing himself up to his
 51183	full height and addressing Michaud with a gracious and majestic gesture,
 51184	âand tell our brave men and all my good subjects wherever you go that
 51185	when I have not a soldier left I shall put myself at the head of my
 51186	beloved nobility and my good peasants and so use the last resources of
 51187	my empire. It still offers me more than my enemies suppose,â said the
 51188	Emperor growing more and more animated; âbut should it ever be ordained
 51189	by Divine Providence,â he continued, raising to heaven his fine eyes
 51190	shining with emotion, âthat my dynasty should cease to reign on the
 51191	throne of my ancestors, then after exhausting all the means at my
 51192	command, I shall let my beard grow to hereâ (he pointed halfway down his
 51193	chest) âand go and eat potatoes with the meanest of my peasants, rather
 51194	than sign the disgrace of my country and of my beloved people whose
 51195	sacrifices I know how to appreciate.â
 51196	
 51197	Having uttered these words in an agitated voice the Emperor suddenly
 51198	turned away as if to hide from Michaud the tears that rose to his eyes,
 51199	and went to the further end of his study. Having stood there a few
 51200	moments, he strode back to Michaud and pressed his arm below the elbow
 51201	with a vigorous movement. The Emperorâs mild and handsome face was
 51202	flushed and his eyes gleamed with resolution and anger.
 51203	
 51204	âColonel Michaud, do not forget what I say to you here, perhaps we may
 51205	recall it with pleasure someday... Napoleon or I,â said the Emperor,
 51206	touching his breast. âWe can no longer both reign together. I have
 51207	learned to know him, and he will not deceive me any more....â
 51208	
 51209	And the Emperor paused, with a frown.
 51210	
 51211	When he heard these words and saw the expression of firm resolution in
 51212	the Emperorâs eyes, Michaudâquoique Ã©tranger, russe de cÅur et dâÃ¢me,âat
 51213	that solemn moment felt himself enraptured by all that he had heard (as
 51214	he used afterwards to say), and gave expression to his own feelings and
 51215	those of the Russian people whose representative he considered himself
 51216	to be, in the following words:
 51217	
 51218	âSire!â said he, âYour Majesty is at this moment signing the glory of
 51219	the nation and the salvation of Europe!â
 51220	
 51221	With an inclination of the head the Emperor dismissed him.
 51222	
 51223	
 51224	
 51225	
 51226	
 51227	CHAPTER IV
 51228	
 51229	It is natural for us who were not living in those days to imagine that
 51230	when half Russia had been conquered and the inhabitants were fleeing to
 51231	distant provinces, and one levy after another was being raised for the
 51232	defense of the fatherland, all Russians from the greatest to the least
 51233	were solely engaged in sacrificing themselves, saving their fatherland,
 51234	or weeping over its downfall. The tales and descriptions of that time
 51235	without exception speak only of the self-sacrifice, patriotic devotion,
 51236	despair, grief, and the heroism of the Russians. But it was not really
 51237	so. It appears so to us because we see only the general historic
 51238	interest of that time and do not see all the personal human interests
 51239	that people had. Yet in reality those personal interests of the moment
 51240	so much transcend the general interests that they always prevent the
 51241	public interest from being felt or even noticed. Most of the people at
 51242	that time paid no attention to the general progress of events but were
 51243	guided only by their private interests, and they were the very people
 51244	whose activities at that period were most useful.
 51245	
 51246	Those who tried to understand the general course of events and to take
 51247	part in it by self-sacrifice and heroism were the most useless members
 51248	of society, they saw everything upside down, and all they did for the
 51249	common good turned out to be useless and foolishâlike Pierreâs and
 51250	MamÃ³novâs regiments which looted Russian villages, and the lint the
 51251	young ladies prepared and that never reached the wounded, and so on.
 51252	Even those, fond of intellectual talk and of expressing their feelings,
 51253	who discussed Russiaâs position at the time involuntarily introduced
 51254	into their conversation either a shade of pretense and falsehood or
 51255	useless condemnation and anger directed against people accused of
 51256	actions no one could possibly be guilty of. In historic events the rule
 51257	forbidding us to eat of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge is specially
 51258	applicable. Only unconscious action bears fruit, and he who plays a part
 51259	in an historic event never understands its significance. If he tries to
 51260	realize it his efforts are fruitless.
 51261	
 51262	The more closely a man was engaged in the events then taking place in
 51263	Russia the less did he realize their significance. In Petersburg and
 51264	in the provinces at a distance from Moscow, ladies, and gentlemen in
 51265	militia uniforms, wept for Russia and its ancient capital and talked of
 51266	self-sacrifice and so on; but in the army which retired beyond Moscow
 51267	there was little talk or thought of Moscow, and when they caught sight
 51268	of its burned ruins no one swore to be avenged on the French, but they
 51269	thought about their next pay, their next quarters, of MatrÃ«shka the
 51270	vivandiÃ¨re, and like matters.
 51271	
 51272	As the war had caught him in the service, Nicholas RostÃ³v took a close
 51273	and prolonged part in the defense of his country, but did so casually,
 51274	without any aim at self-sacrifice, and he therefore looked at what was
 51275	going on in Russia without despair and without dismally racking his
 51276	brains over it. Had he been asked what he thought of the state of
 51277	Russia, he would have said that it was not his business to think about
 51278	it, that KutÃºzov and others were there for that purpose, but that he had
 51279	heard that the regiments were to be made up to their full strength, that
 51280	fighting would probably go on for a long time yet, and that things being
 51281	so it was quite likely he might be in command of a regiment in a couple
 51282	of yearsâ time.
 51283	
 51284	As he looked at the matter in this way, he learned that he was being
 51285	sent to VorÃ³nezh to buy remounts for his division, not only without
 51286	regret at being prevented from taking part in the coming battle, but
 51287	with the greatest pleasureâwhich he did not conceal and which his
 51288	comrades fully understood.
 51289	
 51290	A few days before the battle of BorodinÃ³, Nicholas received the
 51291	necessary money and warrants, and having sent some hussars on in
 51292	advance, he set out with post horses for VorÃ³nezh.
 51293	
 51294	Only a man who has experienced itâthat is, has passed some months
 51295	continuously in an atmosphere of campaigning and warâcan understand the
 51296	delight Nicholas felt when he escaped from the region covered by the
 51297	armyâs foraging operations, provision trains, and hospitals. Whenâfree
 51298	from soldiers, wagons, and the filthy traces of a campâhe saw villages
 51299	with peasants and peasant women, gentlemenâs country houses, fields
 51300	where cattle were grazing, posthouses with stationmasters asleep in
 51301	them, he rejoiced as though seeing all this for the first time. What for
 51302	a long while specially surprised and delighted him were the women, young
 51303	and healthy, without a dozen officers making up to each of them; women,
 51304	too, who were pleased and flattered that a passing officer should joke
 51305	with them.
 51306	
 51307	In the highest spirits Nicholas arrived at night at a hotel in VorÃ³nezh,
 51308	ordered things he had long been deprived of in camp, and next day, very
 51309	clean-shaven and in a full-dress uniform he had not worn for a long
 51310	time, went to present himself to the authorities.
 51311	
 51312	The commander of the militia was a civilian general, an old man who was
 51313	evidently pleased with his military designation and rank. He received
 51314	Nicholas brusquely (imagining this to be characteristically military)
 51315	and questioned him with an important air, as if considering the general
 51316	progress of affairs and approving and disapproving with full right to do
 51317	so. Nicholas was in such good spirits that this merely amused him.
 51318	
 51319	From the commander of the militia he drove to the governor. The governor
 51320	was a brisk little man, very simple and affable. He indicated the stud
 51321	farms at which Nicholas might procure horses, recommended to him a horse
 51322	dealer in the town and a landowner fourteen miles out of town who had
 51323	the best horses, and promised to assist him in every way.
 51324	
 51325	âYou are Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³vâs son? My wife was a great friend of your
 51326	motherâs. We are at home on Thursdaysâtoday is Thursday, so please come
 51327	and see us quite informally,â said the governor, taking leave of him.
 51328	
 51329	Immediately on leaving the governorâs, Nicholas hired post horses and,
 51330	taking his squadron quartermaster with him, drove at a gallop to the
 51331	landowner, fourteen miles away, who had the stud. Everything seemed to
 51332	him pleasant and easy during that first part of his stay in VorÃ³nezh
 51333	and, as usually happens when a man is in a pleasant state of mind,
 51334	everything went well and easily.
 51335	
 51336	The landowner to whom Nicholas went was a bachelor, an old cavalryman, a
 51337	horse fancier, a sportsman, the possessor of some century-old brandy
 51338	and some old Hungarian wine, who had a snuggery where he smoked, and who
 51339	owned some splendid horses.
 51340	
 51341	In very few words Nicholas bought seventeen picked stallions for six
 51342	thousand rublesâto serve, as he said, as samples of his remounts. After
 51343	dining and taking rather too much of the Hungarian wine, Nicholasâhaving
 51344	exchanged kisses with the landowner, with whom he was already on the
 51345	friendliest termsâgalloped back over abominable roads, in the brightest
 51346	frame of mind, continually urging on the driver so as to be in time for
 51347	the governorâs party.
 51348	
 51349	When he had changed, poured water over his head, and scented himself,
 51350	Nicholas arrived at the governorâs rather late, but with the phrase
 51351	âbetter late than neverâ on his lips.
 51352	
 51353	It was not a ball, nor had dancing been announced, but everyone knew
 51354	that Catherine PetrÃ³vna would play valses and the Ã©cossaise on the
 51355	clavichord and that there would be dancing, and so everyone had come as
 51356	to a ball.
 51357	
 51358	Provincial life in 1812 went on very much as usual, but with this
 51359	difference, that it was livelier in the towns in consequence of the
 51360	arrival of many wealthy families from Moscow, and as in everything that
 51361	went on in Russia at that time a special recklessness was noticeable, an
 51362	âin for a penny, in for a poundâwho cares?â spirit, and the inevitable
 51363	small talk, instead of turning on the weather and mutual acquaintances,
 51364	now turned on Moscow, the army, and Napoleon.
 51365	
 51366	The society gathered together at the governorâs was the best in
 51367	VorÃ³nezh.
 51368	
 51369	There were a great many ladies and some of Nicholasâ Moscow
 51370	acquaintances, but there were no men who could at all vie with the
 51371	cavalier of St. George, the hussar remount officer, the good-natured
 51372	and well-bred Count RostÃ³v. Among the men was an Italian prisoner, an
 51373	officer of the French army; and Nicholas felt that the presence of that
 51374	prisoner enhanced his own importance as a Russian hero. The Italian
 51375	was, as it were, a war trophy. Nicholas felt this, it seemed to him
 51376	that everyone regarded the Italian in the same light, and he treated him
 51377	cordially though with dignity and restraint.
 51378	
 51379	As soon as Nicholas entered in his hussar uniform, diffusing around him
 51380	a fragrance of perfume and wine, and had uttered the words âbetter late
 51381	than neverâ and heard them repeated several times by others, people
 51382	clustered around him; all eyes turned on him, and he felt at once
 51383	that he had entered into his proper position in the provinceâthat of
 51384	a universal favorite: a very pleasant position, and intoxicatingly so
 51385	after his long privations. At posting stations, at inns, and in the
 51386	landownerâs snuggery, maidservants had been flattered by his notice, and
 51387	here too at the governorâs party there were (as it seemed to Nicholas)
 51388	an inexhaustible number of pretty young women, married and unmarried,
 51389	impatiently awaiting his notice. The women and girls flirted with him
 51390	and, from the first day, the people concerned themselves to get this
 51391	fine young daredevil of an hussar married and settled down. Among these
 51392	was the governorâs wife herself, who welcomed RostÃ³v as a near relative
 51393	and called him âNicholas.â
 51394	
 51395	Catherine PetrÃ³vna did actually play valses and the Ã©cossaise, and
 51396	dancing began in which Nicholas still further captivated the provincial
 51397	society by his agility. His particularly free manner of dancing even
 51398	surprised them all. Nicholas was himself rather surprised at the way he
 51399	danced that evening. He had never danced like that in Moscow and would
 51400	even have considered such a very free and easy manner improper and in
 51401	bad form, but here he felt it incumbent on him to astonish them all by
 51402	something unusual, something they would have to accept as the regular
 51403	thing in the capital though new to them in the provinces.
 51404	
 51405	All the evening Nicholas paid attention to a blue-eyed, plump and
 51406	pleasing little blonde, the wife of one of the provincial officials.
 51407	With the naÃ¯ve conviction of young men in a merry mood that other menâs
 51408	wives were created for them, RostÃ³v did not leave the ladyâs side and
 51409	treated her husband in a friendly and conspiratorial style, as if,
 51410	without speaking of it, they knew how capitally Nicholas and the lady
 51411	would get on together. The husband, however, did not seem to share that
 51412	conviction and tried to behave morosely with RostÃ³v. But the
 51413	latterâs good-natured naÃ¯vetÃ© was so boundless that sometimes even he
 51414	involuntarily yielded to Nicholasâ good humor. Toward the end of the
 51415	evening, however, as the wifeâs face grew more flushed and animated, the
 51416	husbandâs became more and more melancholy and solemn, as though there
 51417	were but a given amount of animation between them and as the wifeâs
 51418	share increased the husbandâs diminished.

 51424	CHAPTER V
 51425	
 51426	Nicholas sat leaning slightly forward in an armchair, bending closely
 51427	over the blonde lady and paying her mythological compliments with a
 51428	smile that never left his face. Jauntily shifting the position of his
 51429	legs in their tight riding breeches, diffusing an odor of perfume, and
 51430	admiring his partner, himself, and the fine outlines of his legs in
 51431	their well-fitting Hessian boots, Nicholas told the blonde lady that he
 51432	wished to run away with a certain lady here in VorÃ³nezh.
 51433	
 51434	âWhich lady?â
 51435	
 51436	âA charming lady, a divine one. Her eyesâ (Nicholas looked at his
 51437	partner) âare blue, her mouth coral and ivory; her figureâ (he glanced
 51438	at her shoulders) âlike Dianaâs....â
 51439	
 51440	The husband came up and sullenly asked his wife what she was talking
 51441	about.
 51442	
 51443	âAh, NikÃ­ta IvÃ¡nych!â cried Nicholas, rising politely, and as if wishing
 51444	NikÃ­ta IvÃ¡nych to share his joke, he began to tell him of his intention
 51445	to elope with a blonde lady.
 51446	
 51447	The husband smiled gloomily, the wife gaily. The governorâs good-natured
 51448	wife came up with a look of disapproval.
 51449	
 51450	âAnna IgnÃ¡tyevna wants to see you, Nicholas,â said she, pronouncing the
 51451	name so that Nicholas at once understood that Anna IgnÃ¡tyevna was a very
 51452	important person. âCome, Nicholas! You know you let me call you so?â
 51453	
 51454	âOh, yes, Aunt. Who is she?â
 51455	
 51456	âAnna IgnÃ¡tyevna MalvÃ­ntseva. She has heard from her niece how you
 51457	rescued her.... Can you guess?â
 51458	
 51459	âI rescued such a lot of them!â said Nicholas.
 51460	
 51461	âHer niece, Princess BolkÃ³nskaya. She is here in VorÃ³nezh with her aunt.
 51462	Oho! How you blush. Why, are...?â
 51463	
 51464	âNot a bit! Please donât, Aunt!â
 51465	
 51466	âVery well, very well!... Oh, what a fellow you are!â
 51467	
 51468	The governorâs wife led him up to a tall and very stout old lady with
 51469	a blue headdress, who had just finished her game of cards with the most
 51470	important personages of the town. This was MalvÃ­ntseva, Princess Maryâs
 51471	aunt on her motherâs side, a rich, childless widow who always lived in
 51472	VorÃ³nezh. When RostÃ³v approached her she was standing settling up for
 51473	the game. She looked at him and, screwing up her eyes sternly, continued
 51474	to upbraid the general who had won from her.
 51475	
 51476	âVery pleased, mon cher,â she then said, holding out her hand to
 51477	Nicholas. âPray come and see me.â
 51478	
 51479	After a few words about Princess Mary and her late father, whom
 51480	MalvÃ­ntseva had evidently not liked, and having asked what Nicholas
 51481	knew of Prince Andrew, who also was evidently no favorite of hers, the
 51482	important old lady dismissed Nicholas after repeating her invitation to
 51483	come to see her.
 51484	
 51485	Nicholas promised to come and blushed again as he bowed. At the mention
 51486	of Princess Mary he experienced a feeling of shyness and even of fear,
 51487	which he himself did not understand.
 51488	
 51489	When he had parted from MalvÃ­ntseva Nicholas wished to return to the
 51490	dancing, but the governorâs little wife placed her plump hand on his
 51491	sleeve and, saying that she wanted to have a talk with him, led him to
 51492	her sitting room, from which those who were there immediately withdrew
 51493	so as not to be in her way.
 51494	
 51495	âDo you know, dear boy,â began the governorâs wife with a serious
 51496	expression on her kind little face, âthat really would be the match for
 51497	you: would you like me to arrange it?â
 51498	
 51499	âWhom do you mean, Aunt?â asked Nicholas.
 51500	
 51501	âI will make a match for you with the princess. Catherine PetrÃ³vna
 51502	speaks of Lily, but I say, noâthe princess! Do you want me to do it? I
 51503	am sure your mother will be grateful to me. What a charming girl she is,
 51504	really! And she is not at all so plain, either.â
 51505	
 51506	âNot at all,â replied Nicholas as if offended at the idea. âAs befits
 51507	a soldier, Aunt, I donât force myself on anyone or refuse anything,â he
 51508	said before he had time to consider what he was saying.
 51509	
 51510	âWell then, remember, this is not a joke!â
 51511	
 51512	âOf course not!â
 51513	
 51514	âYes, yes,â the governorâs wife said as if talking to herself. âBut,
 51515	my dear boy, among other things you are too attentive to the other, the
 51516	blonde. One is sorry for the husband, really....â
 51517	
 51518	âOh no, we are good friends with him,â said Nicholas in the simplicity
 51519	of his heart; it did not enter his head that a pastime so pleasant to
 51520	himself might not be pleasant to someone else.
 51521	
 51522	âBut what nonsense I have been saying to the governorâs wife!â thought
 51523	Nicholas suddenly at supper. âShe will really begin to arrange a
 51524	match... and SÃ³nya...?â And on taking leave of the governorâs wife,
 51525	when she again smilingly said to him, âWell then, remember!â he drew her
 51526	aside.
 51527	
 51528	âBut see here, to tell the truth, Aunt...â
 51529	
 51530	âWhat is it, my dear? Come, letâs sit down here,â said she.
 51531	
 51532	Nicholas suddenly felt a desire and need to tell his most intimate
 51533	thoughts (which he would not have told to his mother, his sister, or
 51534	his friend) to this woman who was almost a stranger. When he afterwards
 51535	recalled that impulse to unsolicited and inexplicable frankness which
 51536	had very important results for him, it seemed to himâas it seems to
 51537	everyone in such casesâthat it was merely some silly whim that seized
 51538	him: yet that burst of frankness, together with other trifling events,
 51539	had immense consequences for him and for all his family.
 51540	
 51541	âYou see, Aunt, Mamma has long wanted me to marry an heiress, but the
 51542	very idea of marrying for money is repugnant to me.â
 51543	
 51544	âOh yes, I understand,â said the governorâs wife.
 51545	
 51546	âBut Princess BolkÃ³nskayaâthatâs another matter. I will tell you the
 51547	truth. In the first place I like her very much, I feel drawn to her; and
 51548	then, after I met her under such circumstancesâso strangely, the idea
 51549	often occurred to me: âThis is fate.â Especially if you remember that
 51550	Mamma had long been thinking of it; but I had never happened to meet her
 51551	before, somehow it had always happened that we did not meet. And as long
 51552	as my sister NatÃ¡sha was engaged to her brother it was of course out of
 51553	the question for me to think of marrying her. And it must needs happen
 51554	that I should meet her just when NatÃ¡shaâs engagement had been broken
 51555	off... and then everything... So you see... I never told this to anyone
 51556	and never will, only to you.â
 51557	
 51558	The governorâs wife pressed his elbow gratefully.
 51559	
 51560	âYou know SÃ³nya, my cousin? I love her, and promised to marry her, and
 51561	will do so.... So you see there can be no question aboutââ said Nicholas
 51562	incoherently and blushing.
 51563	
 51564	âMy dear boy, what a way to look at it! You know SÃ³nya has nothing and
 51565	you yourself say your Papaâs affairs are in a very bad way. And what
 51566	about your mother? It would kill her, thatâs one thing. And what sort of
 51567	life would it be for SÃ³nyaâif sheâs a girl with a heart? Your mother
 51568	in despair, and you all ruined.... No, my dear, you and SÃ³nya ought to
 51569	understand that.â
 51570	
 51571	Nicholas remained silent. It comforted him to hear these arguments.
 51572	
 51573	âAll the same, Aunt, it is impossible,â he rejoined with a sigh, after
 51574	a short pause. âBesides, would the princess have me? And besides, she is
 51575	now in mourning. How can one think of it!â
 51576	
 51577	âBut you donât suppose Iâm going to get you married at once? There is
 51578	always a right way of doing things,â replied the governorâs wife.
 51579	
 51580	âWhat a matchmaker you are, Aunt...â said Nicholas, kissing her plump
 51581	little hand.
 51582	
 51583	
 51584	
 51585	
 51586	
 51587	CHAPTER VI
 51588	
 51589	On reaching Moscow after her meeting with RostÃ³v, Princess Mary had
 51590	found her nephew there with his tutor, and a letter from Prince Andrew
 51591	giving her instructions how to get to her Aunt MalvÃ­ntseva at VorÃ³nezh.
 51592	That feeling akin to temptation which had tormented her during her
 51593	fatherâs illness, since his death, and especially since her meeting with
 51594	RostÃ³v was smothered by arrangements for the journey, anxiety about her
 51595	brother, settling in a new house, meeting new people, and attending to
 51596	her nephewâs education. She was sad. Now, after a month passed in quiet
 51597	surroundings, she felt more and more deeply the loss of her father which
 51598	was associated in her mind with the ruin of Russia. She was agitated and
 51599	incessantly tortured by the thought of the dangers to which her brother,
 51600	the only intimate person now remaining to her, was exposed. She was
 51601	worried too about her nephewâs education for which she had always felt
 51602	herself incompetent, but in the depths of her soul she felt at peaceâa
 51603	peace arising from consciousness of having stifled those personal dreams
 51604	and hopes that had been on the point of awakening within her and were
 51605	related to her meeting with RostÃ³v.
 51606	
 51607	The day after her party the governorâs wife came to see MalvÃ­ntseva
 51608	and, after discussing her plan with the aunt, remarked that though
 51609	under present circumstances a formal betrothal was, of course, not to be
 51610	thought of, all the same the young people might be brought together and
 51611	could get to know one another. MalvÃ­ntseva expressed approval, and the
 51612	governorâs wife began to speak of RostÃ³v in Maryâs presence, praising
 51613	him and telling how he had blushed when Princess Maryâs name was
 51614	mentioned. But Princess Mary experienced a painful rather than a joyful
 51615	feelingâher mental tranquillity was destroyed, and desires, doubts,
 51616	self-reproach, and hopes reawoke.
 51617	
 51618	During the two days that elapsed before RostÃ³v called, Princess Mary
 51619	continually thought of how she ought to behave to him. First she decided
 51620	not to come to the drawing room when he called to see her auntâthat it
 51621	would not be proper for her, in her deep mourning, to receive visitors;
 51622	then she thought this would be rude after what he had done for her; then
 51623	it occurred to her that her aunt and the governorâs wife had intentions
 51624	concerning herself and RostÃ³vâtheir looks and words at times seemed to
 51625	confirm this suppositionâthen she told herself that only she, with her
 51626	sinful nature, could think this of them: they could not forget that
 51627	situated as she was, while still wearing deep mourning, such matchmaking
 51628	would be an insult to her and to her fatherâs memory. Assuming that she
 51629	did go down to see him, Princess Mary imagined the words he would say
 51630	to her and what she would say to him, and these words sometimes seemed
 51631	undeservedly cold and then to mean too much. More than anything she
 51632	feared lest the confusion she felt might overwhelm her and betray her as
 51633	soon as she saw him.
 51634	
 51635	But when on Sunday after church the footman announced in the drawing
 51636	room that Count RostÃ³v had called, the princess showed no confusion,
 51637	only a slight blush suffused her cheeks and her eyes lit up with a new
 51638	and radiant light.
 51639	
 51640	âYou have met him, Aunt?â said she in a calm voice, unable herself to
 51641	understand that she could be outwardly so calm and natural.
 51642	
 51643	When RostÃ³v entered the room, the princess dropped her eyes for an
 51644	instant, as if to give the visitor time to greet her aunt, and then
 51645	just as Nicholas turned to her she raised her head and met his look with
 51646	shining eyes. With a movement full of dignity and grace she half rose
 51647	with a smile of pleasure, held out her slender, delicate hand to him,
 51648	and began to speak in a voice in which for the first time new deep
 51649	womanly notes vibrated. Mademoiselle Bourienne, who was in the drawing
 51650	room, looked at Princess Mary in bewildered surprise. Herself a
 51651	consummate coquette, she could not have maneuvered better on meeting a
 51652	man she wished to attract.
 51653	
 51654	âEither black is particularly becoming to her or she really has greatly
 51655	improved without my having noticed it. And above all, what tact and
 51656	grace!â thought Mademoiselle Bourienne.
 51657	
 51658	Had Princess Mary been capable of reflection at that moment, she would
 51659	have been more surprised than Mademoiselle Bourienne at the change that
 51660	had taken place in herself. From the moment she recognized that dear,
 51661	loved face, a new life force took possession of her and compelled her to
 51662	speak and act apart from her own will. From the time RostÃ³v entered, her
 51663	face became suddenly transformed. It was as if a light had been kindled
 51664	in a carved and painted lantern and the intricate, skillful, artistic
 51665	work on its sides, that previously seemed dark, coarse, and meaningless,
 51666	was suddenly shown up in unexpected and striking beauty. For the first
 51667	time all that pure, spiritual, inward travail through which she had
 51668	lived appeared on the surface. All her inward labor, her dissatisfaction
 51669	with herself, her sufferings, her strivings after goodness, her
 51670	meekness, love, and self-sacrificeâall this now shone in those radiant
 51671	eyes, in her delicate smile, and in every trait of her gentle face.
 51672	
 51673	RostÃ³v saw all this as clearly as if he had known her whole life. He
 51674	felt that the being before him was quite different from, and better
 51675	than, anyone he had met before, and above all better than himself.
 51676	
 51677	Their conversation was very simple and unimportant. They spoke of the
 51678	war, and like everyone else unconsciously exaggerated their sorrow
 51679	about it; they spoke of their last meetingâNicholas trying to change the
 51680	subjectâthey talked of the governorâs kind wife, of Nicholasâ relations,
 51681	and of Princess Maryâs.
 51682	
 51683	She did not talk about her brother, diverting the conversation as soon
 51684	as her aunt mentioned Andrew. Evidently she could speak of Russiaâs
 51685	misfortunes with a certain artificiality, but her brother was too near
 51686	her heart and she neither could nor would speak lightly of him. Nicholas
 51687	noticed this, as he noticed every shade of Princess Maryâs character
 51688	with an observation unusual to him, and everything confirmed his
 51689	conviction that she was a quite unusual and extraordinary being.
 51690	Nicholas blushed and was confused when people spoke to him about the
 51691	princess (as she did when he was mentioned) and even when he thought of
 51692	her, but in her presence he felt quite at ease, and said not at all what
 51693	he had prepared, but what, quite appropriately, occurred to him at the
 51694	moment.
 51695	
 51696	When a pause occurred during his short visit, Nicholas, as is usual when
 51697	there are children, turned to Prince Andrewâs little son, caressing him
 51698	and asking whether he would like to be an hussar. He took the boy on
 51699	his knee, played with him, and looked round at Princess Mary. With a
 51700	softened, happy, timid look she watched the boy she loved in the arms
 51701	of the man she loved. Nicholas also noticed that look and, as if
 51702	understanding it, flushed with pleasure and began to kiss the boy with
 51703	good natured playfulness.
 51704	
 51705	As she was in mourning Princess Mary did not go out into society, and
 51706	Nicholas did not think it the proper thing to visit her again; but all
 51707	the same the governorâs wife went on with her matchmaking, passing on to
 51708	Nicholas the flattering things Princess Mary said of him and vice
 51709	versa, and insisting on his declaring himself to Princess Mary. For this
 51710	purpose she arranged a meeting between the young people at the bishopâs
 51711	house before Mass.
 51712	
 51713	Though RostÃ³v told the governorâs wife that he would not make any
 51714	declaration to Princess Mary, he promised to go.
 51715	
 51716	As at Tilsit RostÃ³v had not allowed himself to doubt that what everybody
 51717	considered right was right, so now, after a short but sincere struggle
 51718	between his effort to arrange his life by his own sense of justice, and
 51719	in obedient submission to circumstances, he chose the latter and yielded
 51720	to the power he felt irresistibly carrying him he knew not where. He
 51721	knew that after his promise to SÃ³nya it would be what he deemed base to
 51722	declare his feelings to Princess Mary. And he knew that he would never
 51723	act basely. But he also knew (or rather felt at the bottom of his heart)
 51724	that by resigning himself now to the force of circumstances and to those
 51725	who were guiding him, he was not only doing nothing wrong, but was doing
 51726	something very importantâmore important than anything he had ever done
 51727	in his life.
 51728	
 51729	After meeting Princess Mary, though the course of his life went on
 51730	externally as before, all his former amusements lost their charm for him
 51731	and he often thought about her. But he never thought about her as he
 51732	had thought of all the young ladies without exception whom he had met
 51733	in society, nor as he had for a long time, and at one time rapturously,
 51734	thought about SÃ³nya. He had pictured each of those young ladies as
 51735	almost all honest-hearted young men do, that is, as a possible wife,
 51736	adapting her in his imagination to all the conditions of married life:
 51737	a white dressing gown, his wife at the tea table, his wifeâs carriage,
 51738	little ones, Mamma and Papa, their relations to her, and so onâand these
 51739	pictures of the future had given him pleasure. But with Princess Mary,
 51740	to whom they were trying to get him engaged, he could never picture
 51741	anything of future married life. If he tried, his pictures seemed
 51742	incongruous and false. It made him afraid.
 51743	
 51744

 51747	
 51748	CHAPTER VII
 51749	
 51750	The dreadful news of the battle of BorodinÃ³, of our losses in killed and
 51751	wounded, and the still more terrible news of the loss of Moscow reached
 51752	VorÃ³nezh in the middle of September. Princess Mary, having learned of
 51753	her brotherâs wound only from the Gazette and having no definite news of
 51754	him, prepared (so Nicholas heard, he had not seen her again himself) to
 51755	set off in search of Prince Andrew.
 51756	
 51757	When he received the news of the battle of BorodinÃ³ and the abandonment
 51758	of Moscow, RostÃ³v was not seized with despair, anger, the desire for
 51759	vengeance, or any feeling of that kind, but everything in VorÃ³nezh
 51760	suddenly seemed to him dull and tiresome, and he experienced an
 51761	indefinite feeling of shame and awkwardness. The conversations he heard
 51762	seemed to him insincere; he did not know how to judge all these affairs
 51763	and felt that only in the regiment would everything again become clear
 51764	to him. He made haste to finish buying the horses, and often became
 51765	unreasonably angry with his servant and squadron quartermaster.
 51766	
 51767	A few days before his departure a special thanksgiving, at which
 51768	Nicholas was present, was held in the cathedral for the Russian victory.
 51769	He stood a little behind the governor and held himself with military
 51770	decorum through the service, meditating on a great variety of subjects.
 51771	When the service was over the governorâs wife beckoned him to her.
 51772	
 51773	âHave you seen the princess?â she asked, indicating with a movement of
 51774	her head a lady standing on the opposite side, beyond the choir.
 51775	
 51776	Nicholas immediately recognized Princess Mary not so much by the profile
 51777	he saw under her bonnet as by the feeling of solicitude, timidity, and
 51778	pity that immediately overcame him. Princess Mary, evidently engrossed
 51779	by her thoughts, was crossing herself for the last time before leaving
 51780	the church.
 51781	
 51782	Nicholas looked at her face with surprise. It was the same face he had
 51783	seen before, there was the same general expression of refined, inner,
 51784	spiritual labor, but now it was quite differently lit up. There was a
 51785	pathetic expression of sorrow, prayer, and hope in it. As had occurred
 51786	before when she was present, Nicholas went up to her without waiting to
 51787	be prompted by the governorâs wife and not asking himself whether or not
 51788	it was right and proper to address her here in church, and told her he
 51789	had heard of her trouble and sympathized with his whole soul. As soon as
 51790	she heard his voice a vivid glow kindled in her face, lighting up both
 51791	her sorrow and her joy.
 51792	
 51793	âThere is one thing I wanted to tell you, Princess,â said RostÃ³v. âIt
 51794	is that if your brother, Prince Andrew NikolÃ¡evich, were not living, it
 51795	would have been at once announced in the Gazette, as he is a colonel.â
 51796	
 51797	The princess looked at him, not grasping what he was saying, but cheered
 51798	by the expression of regretful sympathy on his face.
 51799	
 51800	âAnd I have known so many cases of a splinter woundâ (the Gazette said
 51801	it was a shell) âeither proving fatal at once or being very slight,â
 51802	continued Nicholas. âWe must hope for the best, and I am sure...â
 51803	
 51804	Princess Mary interrupted him.
 51805	
 51806	âOh, that would be so dread...â she began and, prevented by agitation
 51807	from finishing, she bent her head with a movement as graceful as
 51808	everything she did in his presence and, looking up at him gratefully,
 51809	went out, following her aunt.
 51810	
 51811	That evening Nicholas did not go out, but stayed at home to settle some
 51812	accounts with the horse dealers. When he had finished that business it
 51813	was already too late to go anywhere but still too early to go to bed,
 51814	and for a long time he paced up and down the room, reflecting on his
 51815	life, a thing he rarely did.
 51816	
 51817	Princess Mary had made an agreeable impression on him when he had met
 51818	her in SmolÃ©nsk province. His having encountered her in such exceptional
 51819	circumstances, and his mother having at one time mentioned her to him as
 51820	a good match, had drawn his particular attention to her. When he met her
 51821	again in VorÃ³nezh the impression she made on him was not merely pleasing
 51822	but powerful. Nicholas had been struck by the peculiar moral beauty he
 51823	observed in her at this time. He was, however, preparing to go away and
 51824	it had not entered his head to regret that he was thus depriving himself
 51825	of chances of meeting her. But that dayâs encounter in church had, he
 51826	felt, sunk deeper than was desirable for his peace of mind. That pale,
 51827	sad, refined face, that radiant look, those gentle graceful gestures,
 51828	and especially the deep and tender sorrow expressed in all her features
 51829	agitated him and evoked his sympathy. In men RostÃ³v could not bear to
 51830	see the expression of a higher spiritual life (that was why he did not
 51831	like Prince Andrew) and he referred to it contemptuously as philosophy
 51832	and dreaminess, but in Princess Mary that very sorrow which revealed
 51833	the depth of a whole spiritual world foreign to him was an irresistible
 51834	attraction.
 51835	
 51836	âShe must be a wonderful woman. A real angel!â he said to himself.
 51837	âWhy am I not free? Why was I in such a hurry with SÃ³nya?â And he
 51838	involuntarily compared the two: the lack of spirituality in the one and
 51839	the abundance of it in the otherâa spirituality he himself lacked and
 51840	therefore valued most highly. He tried to picture what would happen were
 51841	he free. How he would propose to her and how she would become his wife.
 51842	But no, he could not imagine that. He felt awed, and no clear picture
 51843	presented itself to his mind. He had long ago pictured to himself a
 51844	future with SÃ³nya, and that was all clear and simple just because it
 51845	had all been thought out and he knew all there was in SÃ³nya, but it was
 51846	impossible to picture a future with Princess Mary, because he did not
 51847	understand her but simply loved her.
 51848	
 51849	Reveries about SÃ³nya had had something merry and playful in them, but to
 51850	dream of Princess Mary was always difficult and a little frightening.
 51851	
 51852	âHow she prayed!â he thought. âIt was plain that her whole soul was in
 51853	her prayer. Yes, that was the prayer that moves mountains, and I am
 51854	sure her prayer will be answered. Why donât I pray for what I want?â he
 51855	suddenly thought. âWhat do I want? To be free, released from SÃ³nya...
 51856	She was right,â he thought, remembering what the governorâs wife had
 51857	said: âNothing but misfortune can come of marrying SÃ³nya. Muddles,
 51858	grief for Mamma... business difficulties... muddles, terrible muddles!
 51859	Besides, I donât love herânot as I should. O, God! release me from
 51860	this dreadful, inextricable position!â he suddenly began to pray. âYes,
 51861	prayer can move mountains, but one must have faith and not pray as
 51862	NatÃ¡sha and I used to as children, that the snow might turn into
 51863	sugarâand then run out into the yard to see whether it had done so. No,
 51864	but I am not praying for trifles now,â he thought as he put his pipe
 51865	down in a corner, and folding his hands placed himself before the icon.
 51866	Softened by memories of Princess Mary he began to pray as he had not
 51867	done for a long time. Tears were in his eyes and in his throat when the
 51868	door opened and LavrÃºshka came in with some papers.
 51869	
 51870	âBlockhead! Why do you come in without being called?â cried Nicholas,
 51871	quickly changing his attitude.
 51872	
 51873	âFrom the governor,â said LavrÃºshka in a sleepy voice. âA courier has
 51874	arrived and thereâs a letter for you.â
 51875	
 51876	âWell, all right, thanks. You can go!â
 51877	
 51878	Nicholas took the two letters, one of which was from his mother and
 51879	the other from SÃ³nya. He recognized them by the handwriting and opened
 51880	SÃ³nyaâs first. He had read only a few lines when he turned pale and his
 51881	eyes opened wide with fear and joy.
 51882	
 51883	âNo, itâs not possible!â he cried aloud.
 51884	
 51885	Unable to sit still he paced up and down the room holding the letter and
 51886	reading it. He glanced through it, then read it again, and then again,
 51887	and standing still in the middle of the room he raised his shoulders,
 51888	stretching out his hands, with his mouth wide open and his eyes fixed.
 51889	What he had just been praying for with confidence that God would hear
 51890	him had come to pass; but Nicholas was as much astonished as if it were
 51891	something extraordinary and unexpected, and as if the very fact that it
 51892	had happened so quickly proved that it had not come from God to whom he
 51893	had prayed, but by some ordinary coincidence.
 51894	
 51895	This unexpected and, as it seemed to Nicholas, quite voluntary letter
 51896	from SÃ³nya freed him from the knot that fettered him and from which
 51897	there had seemed no escape. She wrote that the last unfortunate
 51898	eventsâthe loss of almost the whole of the RostÃ³vsâ Moscow propertyâand
 51899	the countessâ repeatedly expressed wish that Nicholas should marry
 51900	Princess BolkÃ³nskaya, together with his silence and coldness of late,
 51901	had all combined to make her decide to release him from his promise and
 51902	set him completely free.
 51903	
 51904	It would be too painful to me to think that I might be a cause of sorrow
 51905	or discord in the family that has been so good to me (she wrote), and my
 51906	love has no aim but the happiness of those I love; so, Nicholas, I
 51907	beg you to consider yourself free, and to be assured that, in spite of
 51908	everything, no one can love you more than does
 51909	
 51910	Your SÃ³nya
 51911	
 51912	Both letters were written from TrÃ³itsa. The other, from the countess,
 51913	described their last days in Moscow, their departure, the fire, and
 51914	the destruction of all their property. In this letter the countess also
 51915	mentioned that Prince Andrew was among the wounded traveling with them;
 51916	his state was very critical, but the doctor said there was now more
 51917	hope. SÃ³nya and NatÃ¡sha were nursing him.
 51918	
 51919	Next day Nicholas took his motherâs letter and went to see Princess
 51920	Mary. Neither he nor she said a word about what âNatÃ¡sha nursing himâ
 51921	might mean, but thanks to this letter Nicholas suddenly became almost as
 51922	intimate with the princess as if they were relations.
 51923	
 51924	The following day he saw Princess Mary off on her journey to YaroslÃ¡vl,
 51925	and a few days later left to rejoin his regiment.

 51931	CHAPTER VIII
 51932	
 51933	SÃ³nyaâs letter written from TrÃ³itsa, which had come as an answer to
 51934	Nicholasâ prayer, was prompted by this: the thought of getting Nicholas
 51935	married to an heiress occupied the old countessâ mind more and more. She
 51936	knew that SÃ³nya was the chief obstacle to this happening, and SÃ³nyaâs
 51937	life in the countessâ house had grown harder and harder, especially
 51938	after they had received a letter from Nicholas telling of his meeting
 51939	with Princess Mary in BoguchÃ¡rovo. The countess let no occasion slip of
 51940	making humiliating or cruel allusions to SÃ³nya.
 51941	
 51942	But a few days before they left Moscow, moved and excited by all that
 51943	was going on, she called SÃ³nya to her and, instead of reproaching and
 51944	making demands on her, tearfully implored her to sacrifice herself
 51945	and repay all that the family had done for her by breaking off her
 51946	engagement with Nicholas.
 51947	
 51948	âI shall not be at peace till you promise me this.â
 51949	
 51950	SÃ³nya burst into hysterical tears and replied through her sobs that
 51951	she would do anything and was prepared for anything, but gave no actual
 51952	promise and could not bring herself to decide to do what was demanded
 51953	of her. She must sacrifice herself for the family that had reared and
 51954	brought her up. To sacrifice herself for others was SÃ³nyaâs habit. Her
 51955	position in the house was such that only by sacrifice could she show her
 51956	worth, and she was accustomed to this and loved doing it. But in all her
 51957	former acts of self-sacrifice she had been happily conscious that they
 51958	raised her in her own esteem and in that of others, and so made her more
 51959	worthy of Nicholas whom she loved more than anything in the world. But
 51960	now they wanted her to sacrifice the very thing that constituted the
 51961	whole reward for her self-sacrifice and the whole meaning of her life.
 51962	And for the first time she felt bitterness against those who had been
 51963	her benefactors only to torture her the more painfully; she felt jealous
 51964	of NatÃ¡sha who had never experienced anything of this sort, had never
 51965	needed to sacrifice herself, but made others sacrifice themselves for
 51966	her and yet was beloved by everybody. And for the first time SÃ³nya felt
 51967	that out of her pure, quiet love for Nicholas a passionate feeling
 51968	was beginning to grow up which was stronger than principle, virtue,
 51969	or religion. Under the influence of this feeling SÃ³nya, whose life of
 51970	dependence had taught her involuntarily to be secretive, having answered
 51971	the countess in vague general terms, avoided talking with her and
 51972	resolved to wait till she should see Nicholas, not in order to set him
 51973	free but on the contrary at that meeting to bind him to her forever.
 51974	
 51975	The bustle and terror of the RostÃ³vsâ last days in Moscow stifled the
 51976	gloomy thoughts that oppressed SÃ³nya. She was glad to find escape
 51977	from them in practical activity. But when she heard of Prince Andrewâs
 51978	presence in their house, despite her sincere pity for him and for
 51979	NatÃ¡sha, she was seized by a joyful and superstitious feeling that God
 51980	did not intend her to be separated from Nicholas. She knew that NatÃ¡sha
 51981	loved no one but Prince Andrew and had never ceased to love him. She
 51982	knew that being thrown together again under such terrible circumstances
 51983	they would again fall in love with one another, and that Nicholas would
 51984	then not be able to marry Princess Mary as they would be within the
 51985	prohibited degrees of affinity. Despite all the terror of what had
 51986	happened during those last days and during the first days of their
 51987	journey, this feeling that Providence was intervening in her personal
 51988	affairs cheered SÃ³nya.
 51989	
 51990	At the TrÃ³itsa monastery the RostÃ³vs first broke their journey for a
 51991	whole day.
 51992	
 51993	Three large rooms were assigned to them in the monastery hostelry, one
 51994	of which was occupied by Prince Andrew. The wounded man was much better
 51995	that day and NatÃ¡sha was sitting with him. In the next room sat the
 51996	count and countess respectfully conversing with the prior, who was
 51997	calling on them as old acquaintances and benefactors of the monastery.
 51998	SÃ³nya was there too, tormented by curiosity as to what Prince Andrew and
 51999	NatÃ¡sha were talking about. She heard the sound of their voices through
 52000	the door. That door opened and NatÃ¡sha came out, looking excited. Not
 52001	noticing the monk, who had risen to greet her and was drawing back the
 52002	wide sleeve on his right arm, she went up to SÃ³nya and took her hand.
 52003	
 52004	âNatÃ¡sha, what are you about? Come here!â said the countess.
 52005	
 52006	NatÃ¡sha went up to the monk for his blessing, and he advised her to pray
 52007	for aid to God and His saint.
 52008	
 52009	As soon as the prior withdrew, NatÃ¡sha took her friend by the hand and
 52010	went with her into the unoccupied room.
 52011	
 52012	âSÃ³nya, will he live?â she asked. âSÃ³nya, how happy I am, and how
 52013	unhappy!... SÃ³nya, dovey, everything is as it used to be. If only he
 52014	lives! He cannot... because... because... of...â and NatÃ¡sha burst into
 52015	tears.
 52016	
 52017	âYes! I knew it! Thank God!â murmured SÃ³nya. âHe will live.â
 52018	
 52019	SÃ³nya was not less agitated than her friend by the latterâs fear and
 52020	grief and by her own personal feelings which she shared with no one.
 52021	Sobbing, she kissed and comforted NatÃ¡sha. âIf only he lives!â she
 52022	thought. Having wept, talked, and wiped away their tears, the two
 52023	friends went together to Prince Andrewâs door. NatÃ¡sha opened it
 52024	cautiously and glanced into the room, SÃ³nya standing beside her at the
 52025	half-open door.
 52026	
 52027	Prince Andrew was lying raised high on three pillows. His pale face was
 52028	calm, his eyes closed, and they could see his regular breathing.
 52029	
 52030	âO, NatÃ¡sha!â SÃ³nya suddenly almost screamed, catching her companionâs
 52031	arm and stepping back from the door.
 52032	
 52033	âWhat? What is it?â asked NatÃ¡sha.
 52034	
 52035	âItâs that, that...â said SÃ³nya, with a white face and trembling lips.
 52036	
 52037	NatÃ¡sha softly closed the door and went with SÃ³nya to the window, not
 52038	yet understanding what the latter was telling her.
 52039	
 52040	âYou remember,â said SÃ³nya with a solemn and frightened expression.
 52041	âYou remember when I looked in the mirror for you... at OtrÃ¡dnoe at
 52042	Christmas? Do you remember what I saw?â
 52043	
 52044	âYes, yes!â cried NatÃ¡sha opening her eyes wide, and vaguely recalling
 52045	that SÃ³nya had told her something about Prince Andrew whom she had seen
 52046	lying down.
 52047	
 52048	âYou remember?â SÃ³nya went on. âI saw it then and told everybody, you
 52049	and DunyÃ¡sha. I saw him lying on a bed,â said she, making a gesture with
 52050	her hand and a lifted finger at each detail, âand that he had his eyes
 52051	closed and was covered just with a pink quilt, and that his hands were
 52052	folded,â she concluded, convincing herself that the details she had just
 52053	seen were exactly what she had seen in the mirror.
 52054	
 52055	She had in fact seen nothing then but had mentioned the first thing that
 52056	came into her head, but what she had invented then seemed to her now
 52057	as real as any other recollection. She not only remembered what she had
 52058	then saidâthat he turned to look at her and smiled and was covered with
 52059	something redâbut was firmly convinced that she had then seen and said
 52060	that he was covered with a pink quilt and that his eyes were closed.
 52061	
 52062	âYes, yes, it really was pink!â cried NatÃ¡sha, who now thought she
 52063	too remembered the word pink being used, and saw in this the most
 52064	extraordinary and mysterious part of the prediction.
 52065	
 52066	âBut what does it mean?â she added meditatively.
 52067	
 52068	âOh, I donât know, it is all so strange,â replied SÃ³nya, clutching at
 52069	her head.
 52070	
 52071	A few minutes later Prince Andrew rang and NatÃ¡sha went to him, but
 52072	SÃ³nya, feeling unusually excited and touched, remained at the window
 52073	thinking about the strangeness of what had occurred.
 52074	
 52075	
 52076	They had an opportunity that day to send letters to the army, and the
 52077	countess was writing to her son.
 52078	
 52079	âSÃ³nya!â said the countess, raising her eyes from her letter as her
 52080	niece passed, âSÃ³nya, wonât you write to Nicholas?â She spoke in a soft,
 52081	tremulous voice, and in the weary eyes that looked over her spectacles
 52082	SÃ³nya read all that the countess meant to convey with these words. Those
 52083	eyes expressed entreaty, shame at having to ask, fear of a refusal, and
 52084	readiness for relentless hatred in case of such refusal.
 52085	
 52086	SÃ³nya went up to the countess and, kneeling down, kissed her hand.
 52087	
 52088	âYes, Mamma, I will write,â said she.
 52089	
 52090	SÃ³nya was softened, excited, and touched by all that had occurred that
 52091	day, especially by the mysterious fulfillment she had just seen of her
 52092	vision. Now that she knew that the renewal of NatÃ¡shaâs relations with
 52093	Prince Andrew would prevent Nicholas from marrying Princess Mary, she
 52094	was joyfully conscious of a return of that self-sacrificing spirit in
 52095	which she was accustomed to live and loved to live. So with a joyful
 52096	consciousness of performing a magnanimous deedâinterrupted several times
 52097	by the tears that dimmed her velvety black eyesâshe wrote that touching
 52098	letter the arrival of which had so amazed Nicholas.
 52099	
 52100	
 52101	
 52102	
 52103	
 52104	CHAPTER IX
 52105	
 52106	The officer and soldiers who had arrested Pierre treated him with
 52107	hostility but yet with respect, in the guardhouse to which he was taken.
 52108	In their attitude toward him could still be felt both uncertainty as
 52109	to who he might beâperhaps a very important personâand hostility as a
 52110	result of their recent personal conflict with him.
 52111	
 52112	But when the guard was relieved next morning, Pierre felt that for the
 52113	new guardâboth officers and menâhe was not as interesting as he had
 52114	been to his captors; and in fact the guard of the second day did not
 52115	recognize in this big, stout man in a peasant coat the vigorous person
 52116	who had fought so desperately with the marauder and the convoy and had
 52117	uttered those solemn words about saving a child; they saw in him only
 52118	No. 17 of the captured Russians, arrested and detained for some reason
 52119	by order of the Higher Command. If they noticed anything remarkable
 52120	about Pierre, it was only his unabashed, meditative concentration
 52121	and thoughtfulness, and the way he spoke French, which struck them as
 52122	surprisingly good. In spite of this he was placed that day with the
 52123	other arrested suspects, as the separate room he had occupied was
 52124	required by an officer.
 52125	
 52126	All the Russians confined with Pierre were men of the lowest class and,
 52127	recognizing him as a gentleman, they all avoided him, more especially as
 52128	he spoke French. Pierre felt sad at hearing them making fun of him.
 52129	
 52130	That evening he learned that all these prisoners (he, probably, among
 52131	them) were to be tried for incendiarism. On the third day he was taken
 52132	with the others to a house where a French general with a white mustache
 52133	sat with two colonels and other Frenchmen with scarves on their arms.
 52134	With the precision and definiteness customary in addressing prisoners,
 52135	and which is supposed to preclude human frailty, Pierre like the others
 52136	was questioned as to who he was, where he had been, with what object,
 52137	and so on.
 52138	
 52139	These questions, like questions put at trials generally, left the
 52140	essence of the matter aside, shut out the possibility of that essenceâs
 52141	being revealed, and were designed only to form a channel through which
 52142	the judges wished the answers of the accused to flow so as to lead to
 52143	the desired result, namely a conviction. As soon as Pierre began to say
 52144	anything that did not fit in with that aim, the channel was removed and
 52145	the water could flow to waste. Pierre felt, moreover, what the accused
 52146	always feel at their trial, perplexity as to why these questions were
 52147	put to him. He had a feeling that it was only out of condescension or a
 52148	kind of civility that this device of placing a channel was employed. He
 52149	knew he was in these menâs power, that only by force had they brought
 52150	him there, that force alone gave them the right to demand answers
 52151	to their questions, and that the sole object of that assembly was to
 52152	inculpate him. And so, as they had the power and wish to inculpate
 52153	him, this expedient of an inquiry and trial seemed unnecessary. It was
 52154	evident that any answer would lead to conviction. When asked what he
 52155	was doing when he was arrested, Pierre replied in a rather tragic manner
 52156	that he was restoring to its parents a child he had saved from the
 52157	flames. Why had he fought the marauder? Pierre answered that he âwas
 52158	protecting a woman,â and that âto protect a woman who was being insulted
 52159	was the duty of every man; that...â They interrupted him, for this
 52160	was not to the point. Why was he in the yard of a burning house where
 52161	witnesses had seen him? He replied that he had gone out to see what
 52162	was happening in Moscow. Again they interrupted him: they had not asked
 52163	where he was going, but why he was found near the fire? Who was he? they
 52164	asked, repeating their first question, which he had declined to answer.
 52165	Again he replied that he could not answer it.
 52166	
 52167	âPut that down, thatâs bad... very bad,â sternly remarked the general
 52168	with the white mustache and red flushed face.
 52169	
 52170	
 52171	On the fourth day fires broke out on the ZÃºbovski rampart.
 52172	
 52173	Pierre and thirteen others were moved to the coach house of a merchantâs
 52174	house near the Crimean bridge. On his way through the streets Pierre
 52175	felt stifled by the smoke which seemed to hang over the whole
 52176	city. Fires were visible on all sides. He did not then realize the
 52177	significance of the burning of Moscow, and looked at the fires with
 52178	horror.
 52179	
 52180	He passed four days in the coach house near the Crimean bridge and
 52181	during that time learned, from the talk of the French soldiers, that all
 52182	those confined there were awaiting a decision which might come any day
 52183	from the marshal. What marshal this was, Pierre could not learn from the
 52184	soldiers. Evidently for them âthe marshalâ represented a very high and
 52185	rather mysterious power.
 52186	
 52187	These first days, before the eighth of September when the prisoners were
 52188	had up for a second examination, were the hardest of all for Pierre.

 52194	CHAPTER X
 52195	
 52196	On the eighth of September an officerâa very important one judging by
 52197	the respect the guards showed himâentered the coach house where the
 52198	prisoners were. This officer, probably someone on the staff, was holding
 52199	a paper in his hand, and called over all the Russians there, naming
 52200	Pierre as âthe man who does not give his name.â Glancing indolently and
 52201	indifferently at all the prisoners, he ordered the officer in charge
 52202	to have them decently dressed and tidied up before taking them to the
 52203	marshal. An hour later a squad of soldiers arrived and Pierre with
 52204	thirteen others was led to the Virginâs Field. It was a fine day, sunny
 52205	after rain, and the air was unusually pure. The smoke did not hang low
 52206	as on the day when Pierre had been taken from the guardhouse on the
 52207	ZÃºbovski rampart, but rose through the pure air in columns. No flames
 52208	were seen, but columns of smoke rose on all sides, and all Moscow as far
 52209	as Pierre could see was one vast charred ruin. On all sides there were
 52210	waste spaces with only stoves and chimney stacks still standing, and
 52211	here and there the blackened walls of some brick houses. Pierre gazed
 52212	at the ruins and did not recognize districts he had known well. Here and
 52213	there he could see churches that had not been burned. The KrÃ©mlin, which
 52214	was not destroyed, gleamed white in the distance with its towers and
 52215	the belfry of IvÃ¡n the Great. The domes of the New Convent of the Virgin
 52216	glittered brightly and its bells were ringing particularly clearly.
 52217	These bells reminded Pierre that it was Sunday and the feast of the
 52218	Nativity of the Virgin. But there seemed to be no one to celebrate this
 52219	holiday: everywhere were blackened ruins, and the few Russians to be
 52220	seen were tattered and frightened people who tried to hide when they saw
 52221	the French.
 52222	
 52223	It was plain that the Russian nest was ruined and destroyed, but in
 52224	place of the Russian order of life that had been destroyed, Pierre
 52225	unconsciously felt that a quite different, firm, French order had been
 52226	established over this ruined nest. He felt this in the looks of
 52227	the soldiers who, marching in regular ranks briskly and gaily, were
 52228	escorting him and the other criminals; he felt it in the looks of an
 52229	important French official in a carriage and pair driven by a soldier,
 52230	whom they met on the way. He felt it in the merry sounds of regimental
 52231	music he heard from the left side of the field, and felt and realized
 52232	it especially from the list of prisoners the French officer had read out
 52233	when he came that morning. Pierre had been taken by one set of soldiers
 52234	and led first to one and then to another place with dozens of other men,
 52235	and it seemed that they might have forgotten him, or confused him with
 52236	the others. But no: the answers he had given when questioned had come
 52237	back to him in his designation as âthe man who does not give his name,â
 52238	and under that appellation, which to Pierre seemed terrible, they were
 52239	now leading him somewhere with unhesitating assurance on their faces
 52240	that he and all the other prisoners were exactly the ones they wanted
 52241	and that they were being taken to the proper place. Pierre felt himself
 52242	to be an insignificant chip fallen among the wheels of a machine whose
 52243	action he did not understand but which was working well.
 52244	
 52245	He and the other prisoners were taken to the right side of the Virginâs
 52246	Field, to a large white house with an immense garden not far from the
 52247	convent. This was Prince ShcherbÃ¡tovâs house, where Pierre had often
 52248	been in other days, and which, as he learned from the talk of the
 52249	soldiers, was now occupied by the marshal, the Duke of EckmÃ¼hl (Davout).
 52250	
 52251	They were taken to the entrance and led into the house one by one.
 52252	Pierre was the sixth to enter. He was conducted through a glass gallery,
 52253	an anteroom, and a hall, which were familiar to him, into a long low
 52254	study at the door of which stood an adjutant.
 52255	
 52256	Davout, spectacles on nose, sat bent over a table at the further end of
 52257	the room. Pierre went close up to him, but Davout, evidently consulting
 52258	a paper that lay before him, did not look up. Without raising his eyes,
 52259	he said in a low voice:
 52260	
 52261	âWho are you?â
 52262	
 52263	Pierre was silent because he was incapable of uttering a word. To him
 52264	Davout was not merely a French general, but a man notorious for his
 52265	cruelty. Looking at his cold face, as he sat like a stern schoolmaster
 52266	who was prepared to wait awhile for an answer, Pierre felt that every
 52267	instant of delay might cost him his life; but he did not know what
 52268	to say. He did not venture to repeat what he had said at his first
 52269	examination, yet to disclose his rank and position was dangerous and
 52270	embarrassing. So he was silent. But before he had decided what to do,
 52271	Davout raised his head, pushed his spectacles back on his forehead,
 52272	screwed up his eyes, and looked intently at him.
 52273	
 52274	âI know that man,â he said in a cold, measured tone, evidently
 52275	calculated to frighten Pierre.
 52276	
 52277	The chill that had been running down Pierreâs back now seized his head
 52278	as in a vise.
 52279	
 52280	âYou cannot know me, General, I have never seen you...â
 52281	
 52282	âHe is a Russian spy,â Davout interrupted, addressing another general
 52283	who was present, but whom Pierre had not noticed.
 52284	
 52285	Davout turned away. With an unexpected reverberation in his voice Pierre
 52286	rapidly began:
 52287	
 52288	âNo, monseigneur,â he said, suddenly remembering that Davout was a duke.
 52289	âNo, monseigneur, you cannot have known me. I am a militia officer and
 52290	have not quitted Moscow.â
 52291	
 52292	âYour name?â asked Davout.
 52293	
 52294	âBezÃºkhov.â
 52295	
 52296	âWhat proof have I that you are not lying?â
 52297	
 52298	âMonseigneur!â exclaimed Pierre, not in an offended but in a pleading
 52299	voice.
 52300	
 52301	Davout looked up and gazed intently at him. For some seconds they looked
 52302	at one another, and that look saved Pierre. Apart from conditions of war
 52303	and law, that look established human relations between the two men. At
 52304	that moment an immense number of things passed dimly through both their
 52305	minds, and they realized that they were both children of humanity and
 52306	were brothers.
 52307	
 52308	At the first glance, when Davout had only raised his head from the
 52309	papers where human affairs and lives were indicated by numbers, Pierre
 52310	was merely a circumstance, and Davout could have shot him without
 52311	burdening his conscience with an evil deed, but now he saw in him a
 52312	human being. He reflected for a moment.
 52313	
 52314	âHow can you show me that you are telling the truth?â said Davout
 52315	coldly.
 52316	
 52317	Pierre remembered Ramballe, and named him and his regiment and the
 52318	street where the house was.
 52319	
 52320	âYou are not what you say,â returned Davout.
 52321	
 52322	In a trembling, faltering voice Pierre began adducing proofs of the
 52323	truth of his statements.
 52324	
 52325	But at that moment an adjutant entered and reported something to Davout.
 52326	
 52327	Davout brightened up at the news the adjutant brought, and began
 52328	buttoning up his uniform. It seemed that he had quite forgotten Pierre.
 52329	
 52330	When the adjutant reminded him of the prisoner, he jerked his head in
 52331	Pierreâs direction with a frown and ordered him to be led away. But
 52332	where they were to take him Pierre did not know: back to the coach house
 52333	or to the place of execution his companions had pointed out to him as
 52334	they crossed the Virginâs Field.
 52335	
 52336	He turned his head and saw that the adjutant was putting another
 52337	question to Davout.
 52338	
 52339	âYes, of course!â replied Davout, but what this âyesâ meant, Pierre did
 52340	not know.
 52341	
 52342	Pierre could not afterwards remember how he went, whether it was far, or
 52343	in which direction. His faculties were quite numbed, he was stupefied,
 52344	and noticing nothing around him went on moving his legs as the others
 52345	did till they all stopped and he stopped too. The only thought in his
 52346	mind at that time was: who was it that had really sentenced him to
 52347	death? Not the men on the commission that had first examined himânot one
 52348	of them wished to or, evidently, could have done it. It was not Davout,
 52349	who had looked at him in so human a way. In another moment Davout would
 52350	have realized that he was doing wrong, but just then the adjutant had
 52351	come in and interrupted him. The adjutant, also, had evidently had no
 52352	evil intent though he might have refrained from coming in. Then who was
 52353	executing him, killing him, depriving him of lifeâhim, Pierre, with all
 52354	his memories, aspirations, hopes, and thoughts? Who was doing this? And
 52355	Pierre felt that it was no one.
 52356	
 52357	It was a systemâa concurrence of circumstances.
 52358	
 52359	A system of some sort was killing himâPierreâdepriving him of life, of
 52360	everything, annihilating him.
 52361	
 52362	
 52363	
 52364	
 52365	
 52366	CHAPTER XI
 52367	
 52368	From Prince ShcherbÃ¡tovâs house the prisoners were led straight down the
 52369	Virginâs Field, to the left of the nunnery, as far as a kitchen garden
 52370	in which a post had been set up. Beyond that post a fresh pit had been
 52371	dug in the ground, and near the post and the pit a large crowd stood
 52372	in a semicircle. The crowd consisted of a few Russians and many
 52373	of Napoleonâs soldiers who were not on dutyâGermans, Italians, and
 52374	Frenchmen, in a variety of uniforms. To the right and left of the post
 52375	stood rows of French troops in blue uniforms with red epaulets and high
 52376	boots and shakos.
 52377	
 52378	The prisoners were placed in a certain order, according to the list
 52379	(Pierre was sixth), and were led to the post. Several drums suddenly
 52380	began to beat on both sides of them, and at that sound Pierre felt as
 52381	if part of his soul had been torn away. He lost the power of thinking or
 52382	understanding. He could only hear and see. And he had only one wishâthat
 52383	the frightful thing that had to happen should happen quickly. Pierre
 52384	looked round at his fellow prisoners and scrutinized them.
 52385	
 52386	The two first were convicts with shaven heads. One was tall and thin,
 52387	the other dark, shaggy, and sinewy, with a flat nose. The third was
 52388	a domestic serf, about forty-five years old, with grizzled hair and a
 52389	plump, well-nourished body. The fourth was a peasant, a very handsome
 52390	man with a broad, light-brown beard and black eyes. The fifth was a
 52391	factory hand, a thin, sallow-faced lad of eighteen in a loose coat.
 52392	
 52393	Pierre heard the French consulting whether to shoot them separately or
 52394	two at a time. âIn couples,â replied the officer in command in a calm
 52395	voice. There was a stir in the ranks of the soldiers and it was evident
 52396	that they were all hurryingânot as men hurry to do something they
 52397	understand, but as people hurry to finish a necessary but unpleasant and
 52398	incomprehensible task.
 52399	
 52400	A French official wearing a scarf came up to the right of the row of
 52401	prisoners and read out the sentence in Russian and in French.
 52402	
 52403	Then two pairs of Frenchmen approached the criminals and at the
 52404	officerâs command took the two convicts who stood first in the row. The
 52405	convicts stopped when they reached the post and, while sacks were being
 52406	brought, looked dumbly around as a wounded beast looks at an approaching
 52407	huntsman. One crossed himself continually, the other scratched his back
 52408	and made a movement of the lips resembling a smile. With hurried hands
 52409	the soldiers blindfolded them, drawing the sacks over their heads, and
 52410	bound them to the post.
 52411	
 52412	Twelve sharpshooters with muskets stepped out of the ranks with a firm
 52413	regular tread and halted eight paces from the post. Pierre turned away
 52414	to avoid seeing what was going to happen. Suddenly a crackling, rolling
 52415	noise was heard which seemed to him louder than the most terrific
 52416	thunder, and he looked round. There was some smoke, and the Frenchmen
 52417	were doing something near the pit, with pale faces and trembling hands.
 52418	Two more prisoners were led up. In the same way and with similar looks,
 52419	these two glanced vainly at the onlookers with only a silent appeal for
 52420	protection in their eyes, evidently unable to understand or believe
 52421	what was going to happen to them. They could not believe it because they
 52422	alone knew what their life meant to them, and so they neither understood
 52423	nor believed that it could be taken from them.
 52424	
 52425	Again Pierre did not wish to look and again turned away; but again the
 52426	sound as of a frightful explosion struck his ear, and at the same moment
 52427	he saw smoke, blood, and the pale, scared faces of the Frenchmen who
 52428	were again doing something by the post, their trembling hands impeding
 52429	one another. Pierre, breathing heavily, looked around as if asking what
 52430	it meant. The same question was expressed in all the looks that met his.
 52431	
 52432	On the faces of all the Russians and of the French soldiers and officers
 52433	without exception, he read the same dismay, horror, and conflict that
 52434	were in his own heart. âBut who, after all, is doing this? They are all
 52435	suffering as I am. Who then is it? Who?â flashed for an instant through
 52436	his mind.
 52437	
 52438	âSharpshooters of the 86th, forward!â shouted someone. The fifth
 52439	prisoner, the one next to Pierre, was led awayâalone. Pierre did not
 52440	understand that he was saved, that he and the rest had been brought
 52441	there only to witness the execution. With ever-growing horror, and no
 52442	sense of joy or relief, he gazed at what was taking place. The fifth man
 52443	was the factory lad in the loose cloak. The moment they laid hands on
 52444	him he sprang aside in terror and clutched at Pierre. (Pierre shuddered
 52445	and shook himself free.) The lad was unable to walk. They dragged him
 52446	along, holding him up under the arms, and he screamed. When they got
 52447	him to the post he grew quiet, as if he suddenly understood something.
 52448	Whether he understood that screaming was useless or whether he thought
 52449	it incredible that men should kill him, at any rate he took his stand at
 52450	the post, waiting to be blindfolded like the others, and like a wounded
 52451	animal looked around him with glittering eyes.
 52452	
 52453	Pierre was no longer able to turn away and close his eyes. His curiosity
 52454	and agitation, like that of the whole crowd, reached the highest pitch
 52455	at this fifth murder. Like the others this fifth man seemed calm; he
 52456	wrapped his loose cloak closer and rubbed one bare foot with the other.
 52457	
 52458	When they began to blindfold him he himself adjusted the knot which
 52459	hurt the back of his head; then when they propped him against the
 52460	bloodstained post, he leaned back and, not being comfortable in that
 52461	position, straightened himself, adjusted his feet, and leaned back again
 52462	more comfortably. Pierre did not take his eyes from him and did not miss
 52463	his slightest movement.
 52464	
 52465	Probably a word of command was given and was followed by the reports of
 52466	eight muskets; but try as he would Pierre could not afterwards remember
 52467	having heard the slightest sound of the shots. He only saw how the
 52468	workman suddenly sank down on the cords that held him, how blood showed
 52469	itself in two places, how the ropes slackened under the weight of the
 52470	hanging body, and how the workman sat down, his head hanging unnaturally
 52471	and one leg bent under him. Pierre ran up to the post. No one hindered
 52472	him. Pale, frightened people were doing something around the workman.
 52473	The lower jaw of an old Frenchman with a thick mustache trembled as he
 52474	untied the ropes. The body collapsed. The soldiers dragged it awkwardly
 52475	from the post and began pushing it into the pit.
 52476	
 52477	They all plainly and certainly knew that they were criminals who must
 52478	hide the traces of their guilt as quickly as possible.
 52479	
 52480	Pierre glanced into the pit and saw that the factory lad was lying with
 52481	his knees close up to his head and one shoulder higher than the other.
 52482	That shoulder rose and fell rhythmically and convulsively, but spadefuls
 52483	of earth were already being thrown over the whole body. One of the
 52484	soldiers, evidently suffering, shouted gruffly and angrily at Pierre to
 52485	go back. But Pierre did not understand him and remained near the post,
 52486	and no one drove him away.
 52487	
 52488	When the pit had been filled up a command was given. Pierre was taken
 52489	back to his place, and the rows of troops on both sides of the post
 52490	made a half turn and went past it at a measured pace. The twenty-four
 52491	sharpshooters with discharged muskets, standing in the center of the
 52492	circle, ran back to their places as the companies passed by.
 52493	
 52494	Pierre gazed now with dazed eyes at these sharpshooters who ran in
 52495	couples out of the circle. All but one rejoined their companies. This
 52496	one, a young soldier, his face deadly pale, his shako pushed back, and
 52497	his musket resting on the ground, still stood near the pit at the spot
 52498	from which he had fired. He swayed like a drunken man, taking some steps
 52499	forward and back to save himself from falling. An old, noncommissioned
 52500	officer ran out of the ranks and taking him by the elbow dragged him to
 52501	his company. The crowd of Russians and Frenchmen began to disperse. They
 52502	all went away silently and with drooping heads.
 52503	
 52504	âThat will teach them to start fires,â said one of the Frenchmen.
 52505	
 52506	Pierre glanced round at the speaker and saw that it was a soldier who
 52507	was trying to find some relief after what had been done, but was not
 52508	able to do so. Without finishing what he had begun to say he made a
 52509	hopeless movement with his arm and went away.
 52510	
 52511	
 52512	
 52513	
 52514	
 52515	CHAPTER XII
 52516	
 52517	After the execution Pierre was separated from the rest of the prisoners
 52518	and placed alone in a small, ruined, and befouled church.
 52519	
 52520	Toward evening a noncommissioned officer entered with two soldiers and
 52521	told him that he had been pardoned and would now go to the barracks for
 52522	the prisoners of war. Without understanding what was said to him, Pierre
 52523	got up and went with the soldiers. They took him to the upper end of the
 52524	field, where there were some sheds built of charred planks, beams,
 52525	and battens, and led him into one of them. In the darkness some twenty
 52526	different men surrounded Pierre. He looked at them without understanding
 52527	who they were, why they were there, or what they wanted of him. He heard
 52528	what they said, but did not understand the meaning of the words and
 52529	made no kind of deduction from or application of them. He replied to
 52530	questions they put to him, but did not consider who was listening to his
 52531	replies, nor how they would understand them. He looked at their faces
 52532	and figures, but they all seemed to him equally meaningless.
 52533	
 52534	From the moment Pierre had witnessed those terrible murders committed by
 52535	men who did not wish to commit them, it was as if the mainspring of
 52536	his life, on which everything depended and which made everything appear
 52537	alive, had suddenly been wrenched out and everything had collapsed
 52538	into a heap of meaningless rubbish. Though he did not acknowledge it to
 52539	himself, his faith in the right ordering of the universe, in humanity,
 52540	in his own soul, and in God, had been destroyed. He had experienced this
 52541	before, but never so strongly as now. When similar doubts had assailed
 52542	him before, they had been the result of his own wrongdoing, and at the
 52543	bottom of his heart he had felt that relief from his despair and from
 52544	those doubts was to be found within himself. But now he felt that
 52545	the universe had crumbled before his eyes and only meaningless ruins
 52546	remained, and this not by any fault of his own. He felt that it was not
 52547	in his power to regain faith in the meaning of life.
 52548	
 52549	Around him in the darkness men were standing and evidently something
 52550	about him interested them greatly. They were telling him something and
 52551	asking him something. Then they led him away somewhere, and at last he
 52552	found himself in a corner of the shed among men who were laughing and
 52553	talking on all sides.
 52554	
 52555	âWell, then, mates... that very prince who...â some voice at the other
 52556	end of the shed was saying, with a strong emphasis on the word who.
 52557	
 52558	Sitting silent and motionless on a heap of straw against the wall,
 52559	Pierre sometimes opened and sometimes closed his eyes. But as soon as
 52560	he closed them he saw before him the dreadful face of the factory
 52561	ladâespecially dreadful because of its simplicityâand the faces of the
 52562	murderers, even more dreadful because of their disquiet. And he opened
 52563	his eyes again and stared vacantly into the darkness around him.
 52564	
 52565	Beside him in a stooping position sat a small man of whose presence he
 52566	was first made aware by a strong smell of perspiration which came from
 52567	him every time he moved. This man was doing something to his legs in the
 52568	darkness, and though Pierre could not see his face he felt that the man
 52569	continually glanced at him. On growing used to the darkness Pierre saw
 52570	that the man was taking off his leg bands, and the way he did it aroused
 52571	Pierreâs interest.
 52572	
 52573	Having unwound the string that tied the band on one leg, he carefully
 52574	coiled it up and immediately set to work on the other leg, glancing up
 52575	at Pierre. While one hand hung up the first string the other was already
 52576	unwinding the band on the second leg. In this way, having carefully
 52577	removed the leg bands by deft circular motions of his arm following
 52578	one another uninterruptedly, the man hung the leg bands up on some pegs
 52579	fixed above his head. Then he took out a knife, cut something, closed
 52580	the knife, placed it under the head of his bed, and, seating himself
 52581	comfortably, clasped his arms round his lifted knees and fixed his eyes
 52582	on Pierre. The latter was conscious of something pleasant, comforting,
 52583	and well-rounded in these deft movements, in the manâs well-ordered
 52584	arrangements in his corner, and even in his very smell, and he looked at
 52585	the man without taking his eyes from him.
 52586	
 52587	âYouâve seen a lot of trouble, sir, eh?â the little man suddenly said.
 52588	
 52589	And there was so much kindliness and simplicity in his singsong voice
 52590	that Pierre tried to reply, but his jaw trembled and he felt tears
 52591	rising to his eyes. The little fellow, giving Pierre no time to betray
 52592	his confusion, instantly continued in the same pleasant tones:
 52593	
 52594	âEh, lad, donât fret!â said he, in the tender singsong caressing voice
 52595	old Russian peasant women employ. âDonât fret, friendââsuffer an hour,
 52596	live for an age!â thatâs how it is, my dear fellow. And here we live,
 52597	thank heaven, without offense. Among these folk, too, there are good
 52598	men as well as bad,â said he, and still speaking, he turned on his knees
 52599	with a supple movement, got up, coughed, and went off to another part of
 52600	the shed.
 52601	
 52602	âEh, you rascal!â Pierre heard the same kind voice saying at the other
 52603	end of the shed. âSo youâve come, you rascal? She remembers... Now, now,
 52604	thatâll do!â
 52605	
 52606	And the soldier, pushing away a little dog that was jumping up at
 52607	him, returned to his place and sat down. In his hands he had something
 52608	wrapped in a rag.
 52609	
 52610	âHere, eat a bit, sir,â said he, resuming his former respectful tone as
 52611	he unwrapped and offered Pierre some baked potatoes. âWe had soup for
 52612	dinner and the potatoes are grand!â
 52613	
 52614	Pierre had not eaten all day and the smell of the potatoes seemed
 52615	extremely pleasant to him. He thanked the soldier and began to eat.
 52616	
 52617	âWell, are they all right?â said the soldier with a smile. âYou should
 52618	do like this.â
 52619	
 52620	He took a potato, drew out his clasp knife, cut the potato into two
 52621	equal halves on the palm of his hand, sprinkled some salt on it from the
 52622	rag, and handed it to Pierre.
 52623	
 52624	âThe potatoes are grand!â he said once more. âEat some like that!â
 52625	
 52626	Pierre thought he had never eaten anything that tasted better.
 52627	
 52628	âOh, Iâm all right,â said he, âbut why did they shoot those poor
 52629	fellows? The last one was hardly twenty.â
 52630	
 52631	âTss, tt...!â said the little man. âAh, what a sin... what a sin!â he
 52632	added quickly, and as if his words were always waiting ready in his
 52633	mouth and flew out involuntarily he went on: âHow was it, sir, that you
 52634	stayed in Moscow?â
 52635	
 52636	âI didnât think they would come so soon. I stayed accidentally,â replied
 52637	Pierre.
 52638	
 52639	âAnd how did they arrest you, dear lad? At your house?â
 52640	
 52641	âNo, I went to look at the fire, and they arrested me there, and tried
 52642	me as an incendiary.â
 52643	
 52644	âWhere thereâs law thereâs injustice,â put in the little man.
 52645	
 52646	âAnd have you been here long?â Pierre asked as he munched the last of
 52647	the potato.
 52648	
 52649	âI? It was last Sunday they took me, out of a hospital in Moscow.â
 52650	
 52651	âWhy, are you a soldier then?â
 52652	
 52653	âYes, we are soldiers of the Ãpsheron regiment. I was dying of fever. We
 52654	werenât told anything. There were some twenty of us lying there. We had
 52655	no idea, never guessed at all.â
 52656	
 52657	âAnd do you feel sad here?â Pierre inquired.
 52658	
 52659	âHow can one help it, lad? My name is PlatÃ³n, and the surname is
 52660	KaratÃ¡ev,â he added, evidently wishing to make it easier for Pierre to
 52661	address him. âThey call me âlittle falconâ in the regiment. How is one
 52662	to help feeling sad? Moscowâsheâs the mother of cities. How can one see
 52663	all this and not feel sad? But âthe maggot gnaws the cabbage, yet dies
 52664	firstâ; thatâs what the old folks used to tell us,â he added rapidly.
 52665	
 52666	âWhat? What did you say?â asked Pierre.
 52667	
 52668	âWho? I?â said KaratÃ¡ev. âI say things happen not as we plan but as God
 52669	judges,â he replied, thinking that he was repeating what he had said
 52670	before, and immediately continued:
 52671	
 52672	âWell, and you, have you a family estate, sir? And a house? So you have
 52673	abundance, then? And a housewife? And your old parents, are they still
 52674	living?â he asked.
 52675	
 52676	And though it was too dark for Pierre to see, he felt that a suppressed
 52677	smile of kindliness puckered the soldierâs lips as he put these
 52678	questions. He seemed grieved that Pierre had no parents, especially that
 52679	he had no mother.
 52680	
 52681	âA wife for counsel, a mother-in-law for welcome, but thereâs none as
 52682	dear as oneâs own mother!â said he. âWell, and have you little ones?â he
 52683	went on asking.
 52684	
 52685	Again Pierreâs negative answer seemed to distress him, and he hastened
 52686	to add:
 52687	
 52688	âNever mind! Youâre young folks yet, and please God may still have some.
 52689	The great thing is to live in harmony....â
 52690	
 52691	âBut itâs all the same now,â Pierre could not help saying.
 52692	
 52693	âAh, my dear fellow!â rejoined KaratÃ¡ev, ânever decline a prison or a
 52694	beggarâs sack!â
 52695	
 52696	He seated himself more comfortably and coughed, evidently preparing to
 52697	tell a long story.
 52698	
 52699	âWell, my dear fellow, I was still living at home,â he began. âWe had
 52700	a well-to-do homestead, plenty of land, we peasants lived well and our
 52701	house was one to thank God for. When Father and we went out mowing
 52702	there were seven of us. We lived well. We were real peasants. It so
 52703	happened...â
 52704	
 52705	And PlatÃ³n KaratÃ¡ev told a long story of how he had gone into someoneâs
 52706	copse to take wood, how he had been caught by the keeper, had been
 52707	tried, flogged, and sent to serve as a soldier.
 52708	
 52709	âWell, lad,â and a smile changed the tone of his voice âwe thought it
 52710	was a misfortune but it turned out a blessing! If it had not been for
 52711	my sin, my brother would have had to go as a soldier. But he, my younger
 52712	brother, had five little ones, while I, you see, only left a wife
 52713	behind. We had a little girl, but God took her before I went as a
 52714	soldier. I come home on leave and Iâll tell you how it was, I look and
 52715	see that they are living better than before. The yard full of cattle,
 52716	the women at home, two brothers away earning wages, and only Michael the
 52717	youngest, at home. Father, he says, âAll my children are the same to
 52718	me: it hurts the same whichever finger gets bitten. But if PlatÃ³n hadnât
 52719	been shaved for a soldier, Michael would have had to go.â called us
 52720	all to him and, will you believe it, placed us in front of the icons.
 52721	âMichael,â he says, âcome here and bow down to his feet; and you, young
 52722	woman, you bow down too; and you, grandchildren, also bow down before
 52723	him! Do you understand?â he says. Thatâs how it is, dear fellow. Fate
 52724	looks for a head. But we are always judging, âthatâs not wellâthatâs
 52725	not right!â Our luck is like water in a dragnet: you pull at it and it
 52726	bulges, but when youâve drawn it out itâs empty! Thatâs how it is.â
 52727	
 52728	And PlatÃ³n shifted his seat on the straw.
 52729	
 52730	After a short silence he rose.
 52731	
 52732	âWell, I think you must be sleepy,â said he, and began rapidly crossing
 52733	himself and repeating:
 52734	
 52735	âLord Jesus Christ, holy Saint Nicholas, Frola and Lavra! Lord Jesus
 52736	Christ, holy Saint Nicholas, Frola and Lavra! Lord Jesus Christ, have
 52737	mercy on us and save us!â he concluded, then bowed to the ground, got
 52738	up, sighed, and sat down again on his heap of straw. âThatâs the way.
 52739	Lay me down like a stone, O God, and raise me up like a loaf,â he
 52740	muttered as he lay down, pulling his coat over him.
 52741	
 52742	âWhat prayer was that you were saying?â asked Pierre.
 52743	
 52744	âEh?â murmured PlatÃ³n, who had almost fallen asleep. âWhat was I saying?
 52745	I was praying. Donât you pray?â
 52746	
 52747	âYes, I do,â said Pierre. âBut what was that you said: Frola and Lavra?â
 52748	
 52749	âWell, of course,â replied PlatÃ³n quickly, âthe horsesâ saints. One must
 52750	pity the animals too. Eh, the rascal! Now youâve curled up and got warm,
 52751	you daughter of a bitch!â said KaratÃ¡ev, touching the dog that lay at
 52752	his feet, and again turning over he fell asleep immediately.
 52753	
 52754	Sounds of crying and screaming came from somewhere in the distance
 52755	outside, and flames were visible through the cracks of the shed, but
 52756	inside it was quiet and dark. For a long time Pierre did not sleep, but
 52757	lay with eyes open in the darkness, listening to the regular snoring
 52758	of PlatÃ³n who lay beside him, and he felt that the world that had been
 52759	shattered was once more stirring in his soul with a new beauty and on
 52760	new and unshakable foundations.
 52761	
 52762	
 52763	
 52764	
 52765	
 52766	CHAPTER XIII
 52767	
 52768	Twenty-three soldiers, three officers, and two officials were confined
 52769	in the shed in which Pierre had been placed and where he remained for
 52770	four weeks.
 52771	
 52772	When Pierre remembered them afterwards they all seemed misty figures to
 52773	him except PlatÃ³n KaratÃ¡ev, who always remained in his mind a most
 52774	vivid and precious memory and the personification of everything Russian,
 52775	kindly, and round. When Pierre saw his neighbor next morning at dawn
 52776	the first impression of him, as of something round, was fully confirmed:
 52777	PlatÃ³nâs whole figureâin a French overcoat girdled with a cord, a
 52778	soldierâs cap, and bast shoesâwas round. His head was quite round, his
 52779	back, chest, shoulders, and even his arms, which he held as if ever
 52780	ready to embrace something, were rounded, his pleasant smile and his
 52781	large, gentle brown eyes were also round.
 52782	
 52783	PlatÃ³n KaratÃ¡ev must have been fifty, judging by his stories of
 52784	campaigns he had been in, told as by an old soldier. He did not himself
 52785	know his age and was quite unable to determine it. But his brilliantly
 52786	white, strong teeth which showed in two unbroken semicircles when he
 52787	laughedâas he often didâwere all sound and good, there was not a gray
 52788	hair in his beard or on his head, and his whole body gave an impression
 52789	of suppleness and especially of firmness and endurance.
 52790	
 52791	His face, despite its fine, rounded wrinkles, had an expression of
 52792	innocence and youth, his voice was pleasant and musical. But the chief
 52793	peculiarity of his speech was its directness and appositeness. It was
 52794	evident that he never considered what he had said or was going to say,
 52795	and consequently the rapidity and justice of his intonation had an
 52796	irresistible persuasiveness.
 52797	
 52798	His physical strength and agility during the first days of his
 52799	imprisonment were such that he seemed not to know what fatigue and
 52800	sickness meant. Every night before lying down, he said: âLord, lay me
 52801	down as a stone and raise me up as a loaf!â and every morning on getting
 52802	up, he said: âI lay down and curled up, I get up and shake myself.â And
 52803	indeed he only had to lie down, to fall asleep like a stone, and he
 52804	only had to shake himself, to be ready without a momentâs delay for some
 52805	work, just as children are ready to play directly they awake. He could
 52806	do everything, not very well but not badly. He baked, cooked, sewed,
 52807	planed, and mended boots. He was always busy, and only at night allowed
 52808	himself conversationâof which he was fondâand songs. He did not sing
 52809	like a trained singer who knows he is listened to, but like the birds,
 52810	evidently giving vent to the sounds in the same way that one stretches
 52811	oneself or walks about to get rid of stiffness, and the sounds were
 52812	always high-pitched, mournful, delicate, and almost feminine, and his
 52813	face at such times was very serious.
 52814	
 52815	Having been taken prisoner and allowed his beard to grow, he seemed to
 52816	have thrown off all that had been forced upon himâeverything military
 52817	and alien to himselfâand had returned to his former peasant habits.
 52818	
 52819	âA soldier on leaveâa shirt outside breeches,â he would say.
 52820	
 52821	He did not like talking about his life as a soldier, though he did not
 52822	complain, and often mentioned that he had not been flogged once during
 52823	the whole of his army service. When he related anything it was generally
 52824	some old and evidently precious memory of his âChristianâ life, as he
 52825	called his peasant existence. The proverbs, of which his talk was full,
 52826	were for the most part not the coarse and indecent saws soldiers
 52827	employ, but those folk sayings which taken without a context seem so
 52828	insignificant, but when used appositely suddenly acquire a significance
 52829	of profound wisdom.
 52830	
 52831	He would often say the exact opposite of what he had said on a previous
 52832	occasion, yet both would be right. He liked to talk and he talked well,
 52833	adorning his speech with terms of endearment and with folk sayings which
 52834	Pierre thought he invented himself, but the chief charm of his talk lay
 52835	in the fact that the commonest eventsâsometimes just such as Pierre
 52836	had witnessed without taking notice of themâassumed in KaratÃ¡evâs a
 52837	character of solemn fitness. He liked to hear the folk tales one of the
 52838	soldiers used to tell of an evening (they were always the same), but
 52839	most of all he liked to hear stories of real life. He would smile
 52840	joyfully when listening to such stories, now and then putting in a word
 52841	or asking a question to make the moral beauty of what he was told clear
 52842	to himself. KaratÃ¡ev had no attachments, friendships, or love, as Pierre
 52843	understood them, but loved and lived affectionately with everything life
 52844	brought him in contact with, particularly with manânot any particular
 52845	man, but those with whom he happened to be. He loved his dog, his
 52846	comrades, the French, and Pierre who was his neighbor, but Pierre felt
 52847	that in spite of KaratÃ¡evâs affectionate tenderness for him (by which
 52848	he unconsciously gave Pierreâs spiritual life its due) he would not have
 52849	grieved for a moment at parting from him. And Pierre began to feel in
 52850	the same way toward KaratÃ¡ev.
 52851	
 52852	To all the other prisoners PlatÃ³n KaratÃ¡ev seemed a most ordinary
 52853	soldier. They called him âlittle falconâ or âPlatÃ³sha,â chaffed him
 52854	good-naturedly, and sent him on errands. But to Pierre he always
 52855	remained what he had seemed that first night: an unfathomable, rounded,
 52856	eternal personification of the spirit of simplicity and truth.
 52857	
 52858	PlatÃ³n KaratÃ¡ev knew nothing by heart except his prayers. When he began
 52859	to speak he seemed not to know how he would conclude.
 52860	
 52861	Sometimes Pierre, struck by the meaning of his words, would ask him to
 52862	repeat them, but PlatÃ³n could never recall what he had said a moment
 52863	before, just as he never could repeat to Pierre the words of his
 52864	favorite song: native and birch tree and my heart is sick occurred in
 52865	it, but when spoken and not sung, no meaning could be got out of it. He
 52866	did not, and could not, understand the meaning of words apart from
 52867	their context. Every word and action of his was the manifestation of
 52868	an activity unknown to him, which was his life. But his life, as he
 52869	regarded it, had no meaning as a separate thing. It had meaning only as
 52870	part of a whole of which he was always conscious. His words and actions
 52871	flowed from him as evenly, inevitably, and spontaneously as fragrance
 52872	exhales from a flower. He could not understand the value or significance
 52873	of any word or deed taken separately.
 52874	
 52875	
 52876	
 52877	
 52878	
 52879	CHAPTER XIV
 52880	
 52881	When Princess Mary heard from Nicholas that her brother was with the
 52882	RostÃ³vs at YaroslÃ¡vl she at once prepared to go there, in spite of her
 52883	auntâs efforts to dissuade herâand not merely to go herself but to take
 52884	her nephew with her. Whether it were difficult or easy, possible or
 52885	impossible, she did not ask and did not want to know: it was her duty,
 52886	not only to herself, to be near her brother who was perhaps dying, but
 52887	to do everything possible to take his son to him, and so she prepared
 52888	to set off. That she had not heard from Prince Andrew himself, Princess
 52889	Mary attributed to his being too weak to write or to his considering the
 52890	long journey too hard and too dangerous for her and his son.
 52891	
 52892	In a few days Princess Mary was ready to start. Her equipages were the
 52893	huge family coach in which she had traveled to VorÃ³nezh, a semiopen
 52894	trap, and a baggage cart. With her traveled Mademoiselle Bourienne,
 52895	little Nicholas and his tutor, her old nurse, three maids, TÃ­khon, and a
 52896	young footman and courier her aunt had sent to accompany her.
 52897	
 52898	The usual route through Moscow could not be thought of, and the
 52899	roundabout way Princess Mary was obliged to take through LÃ­petsk,
 52900	RyazÃ¡n, VladÃ­mir, and ShÃºya was very long and, as post horses were not
 52901	everywhere obtainable, very difficult, and near RyazÃ¡n where the French
 52902	were said to have shown themselves was even dangerous.
 52903	
 52904	During this difficult journey Mademoiselle Bourienne, Dessalles, and
 52905	Princess Maryâs servants were astonished at her energy and firmness of
 52906	spirit. She went to bed later and rose earlier than any of them, and
 52907	no difficulties daunted her. Thanks to her activity and energy, which
 52908	infected her fellow travelers, they approached YaroslÃ¡vl by the end of
 52909	the second week.
 52910	
 52911	The last days of her stay in VorÃ³nezh had been the happiest of her life.
 52912	Her love for RostÃ³v no longer tormented or agitated her. It filled her
 52913	whole soul, had become an integral part of herself, and she no longer
 52914	struggled against it. Latterly she had become convinced that she loved
 52915	and was beloved, though she never said this definitely to herself
 52916	in words. She had become convinced of it at her last interview with
 52917	Nicholas, when he had come to tell her that her brother was with the
 52918	RostÃ³vs. Not by a single word had Nicholas alluded to the fact that
 52919	Prince Andrewâs relations with NatÃ¡sha might, if he recovered, be
 52920	renewed, but Princess Mary saw by his face that he knew and thought of
 52921	this.
 52922	
 52923	Yet in spite of that, his relation to herâconsiderate, delicate, and
 52924	lovingânot only remained unchanged, but it sometimes seemed to Princess
 52925	Mary that he was even glad that the family connection between them
 52926	allowed him to express his friendship more freely. She knew that she
 52927	loved for the first and only time in her life and felt that she was
 52928	beloved, and was happy in regard to it.
 52929	
 52930	But this happiness on one side of her spiritual nature did not prevent
 52931	her feeling grief for her brother with full force; on the contrary, that
 52932	spiritual tranquility on the one side made it the more possible for her
 52933	to give full play to her feeling for her brother. That feeling was so
 52934	strong at the moment of leaving VorÃ³nezh that those who saw her off, as
 52935	they looked at her careworn, despairing face, felt sure she would fall
 52936	ill on the journey. But the very difficulties and preoccupations of the
 52937	journey, which she took so actively in hand, saved her for a while from
 52938	her grief and gave her strength.
 52939	
 52940	As always happens when traveling, Princess Mary thought only of the
 52941	journey itself, forgetting its object. But as she approached YaroslÃ¡vl
 52942	the thought of what might await her thereânot after many days, but that
 52943	very eveningâagain presented itself to her and her agitation increased
 52944	to its utmost limit.
 52945	
 52946	The courier who had been sent on in advance to find out where the
 52947	RostÃ³vs were staying in YaroslÃ¡vl, and in what condition Prince Andrew
 52948	was, when he met the big coach just entering the town gates was appalled
 52949	by the terrible pallor of the princessâ face that looked out at him from
 52950	the window.
 52951	
 52952	âI have found out everything, your excellency: the RostÃ³vs are staying
 52953	at the merchant BrÃ³nnikovâs house, in the Square not far from here,
 52954	right above the VÃ³lga,â said the courier.
 52955	
 52956	Princess Mary looked at him with frightened inquiry, not understanding
 52957	why he did not reply to what she chiefly wanted to know: how was her
 52958	brother? Mademoiselle Bourienne put that question for her.
 52959	
 52960	âHow is the prince?â she asked.
 52961	
 52962	âHis excellency is staying in the same house with them.â
 52963	
 52964	âThen he is alive,â thought Princess Mary, and asked in a low voice:
 52965	âHow is he?â
 52966	
 52967	âThe servants say he is still the same.â
 52968	
 52969	What âstill the sameâ might mean Princess Mary did not ask, but with an
 52970	unnoticed glance at little seven-year-old Nicholas, who was sitting in
 52971	front of her looking with pleasure at the town, she bowed her head
 52972	and did not raise it again till the heavy coach, rumbling, shaking and
 52973	swaying, came to a stop. The carriage steps clattered as they were let
 52974	down.
 52975	
 52976	The carriage door was opened. On the left there was waterâa great
 52977	riverâand on the right a porch. There were people at the entrance:
 52978	servants, and a rosy girl with a large plait of black hair, smiling as
 52979	it seemed to Princess Mary in an unpleasantly affected way. (This was
 52980	SÃ³nya.) Princess Mary ran up the steps. âThis way, this way!â said the
 52981	girl, with the same artificial smile, and the princess found herself in
 52982	the hall facing an elderly woman of Oriental type, who came rapidly to
 52983	meet her with a look of emotion. This was the countess. She embraced
 52984	Princess Mary and kissed her.
 52985	
 52986	âMon enfant!â she muttered, âje vous aime et vous connais depuis
 52987	longtemps.â *
 52988	
 52989	    * âMy child! I love you and have known you a long time.â
 52990	
 52991	
 52992	Despite her excitement, Princess Mary realized that this was the
 52993	countess and that it was necessary to say something to her. Hardly
 52994	knowing how she did it, she contrived to utter a few polite phrases in
 52995	French in the same tone as those that had been addressed to her, and
 52996	asked: âHow is he?â
 52997	
 52998	âThe doctor says that he is not in danger,â said the countess, but as
 52999	she spoke she raised her eyes with a sigh, and her gesture conveyed a
 53000	contradiction of her words.
 53001	
 53002	âWhere is he? Can I see himâcan I?â asked the princess.
 53003	
 53004	âOne moment, Princess, one moment, my dear! Is this his son?â said the
 53005	countess, turning to little Nicholas who was coming in with Dessalles.
 53006	âThere will be room for everybody, this is a big house. Oh, what a
 53007	lovely boy!â
 53008	
 53009	The countess took Princess Mary into the drawing room, where SÃ³nya was
 53010	talking to Mademoiselle Bourienne. The countess caressed the boy, and
 53011	the old count came in and welcomed the princess. He had changed very
 53012	much since Princess Mary had last seen him. Then he had been a brisk,
 53013	cheerful, self-assured old man; now he seemed a pitiful, bewildered
 53014	person. While talking to Princess Mary he continually looked round as
 53015	if asking everyone whether he was doing the right thing. After the
 53016	destruction of Moscow and of his property, thrown out of his accustomed
 53017	groove he seemed to have lost the sense of his own significance and to
 53018	feel that there was no longer a place for him in life.
 53019	
 53020	In spite of her one desire to see her brother as soon as possible, and
 53021	her vexation that at the moment when all she wanted was to see him they
 53022	should be trying to entertain her and pretending to admire her nephew,
 53023	the princess noticed all that was going on around her and felt the
 53024	necessity of submitting, for a time, to this new order of things which
 53025	she had entered. She knew it to be necessary, and though it was hard for
 53026	her she was not vexed with these people.
 53027	
 53028	âThis is my niece,â said the count, introducing SÃ³nyaââYou donât know
 53029	her, Princess?â
 53030	
 53031	Princess Mary turned to SÃ³nya and, trying to stifle the hostile
 53032	feeling that arose in her toward the girl, she kissed her. But she felt
 53033	oppressed by the fact that the mood of everyone around her was so far
 53034	from what was in her own heart.
 53035	
 53036	âWhere is he?â she asked again, addressing them all.
 53037	
 53038	âHe is downstairs. NatÃ¡sha is with him,â answered SÃ³nya, flushing. âWe
 53039	have sent to ask. I think you must be tired, Princess.â
 53040	
 53041	Tears of vexation showed themselves in Princess Maryâs eyes. She turned
 53042	away and was about to ask the countess again how to go to him, when
 53043	light, impetuous, and seemingly buoyant steps were heard at the door.
 53044	The princess looked round and saw NatÃ¡sha coming in, almost runningâthat
 53045	NatÃ¡sha whom she had liked so little at their meeting in Moscow long
 53046	since.
 53047	
 53048	But hardly had the princess looked at NatÃ¡shaâs face before she realized
 53049	that here was a real comrade in her grief, and consequently a friend.
 53050	She ran to meet her, embraced her, and began to cry on her shoulder.
 53051	
 53052	As soon as NatÃ¡sha, sitting at the head of Prince Andrewâs bed, heard
 53053	of Princess Maryâs arrival, she softly left his room and hastened to her
 53054	with those swift steps that had sounded buoyant to Princess Mary.
 53055	
 53056	There was only one expression on her agitated face when she ran into the
 53057	drawing roomâthat of loveâboundless love for him, for her, and for all
 53058	that was near to the man she loved; and of pity, suffering for others,
 53059	and passionate desire to give herself entirely to helping them. It was
 53060	plain that at that moment there was in NatÃ¡shaâs heart no thought of
 53061	herself or of her own relations with Prince Andrew.
 53062	
 53063	Princess Mary, with her acute sensibility, understood all this at the
 53064	first glance at NatÃ¡shaâs face, and wept on her shoulder with sorrowful
 53065	pleasure.
 53066	
 53067	âCome, come to him, Mary,â said NatÃ¡sha, leading her into the other
 53068	room.
 53069	
 53070	Princess Mary raised her head, dried her eyes, and turned to NatÃ¡sha.
 53071	She felt that from her she would be able to understand and learn
 53072	everything.
 53073	
 53074	âHow...â she began her question but stopped short.
 53075	
 53076	She felt that it was impossible to ask, or to answer, in words.
 53077	NatÃ¡shaâs face and eyes would have to tell her all more clearly and
 53078	profoundly.
 53079	
 53080	NatÃ¡sha was gazing at her, but seemed afraid and in doubt whether to say
 53081	all she knew or not; she seemed to feel that before those luminous eyes
 53082	which penetrated into the very depths of her heart, it was impossible
 53083	not to tell the whole truth which she saw. And suddenly, NatÃ¡shaâs lips
 53084	twitched, ugly wrinkles gathered round her mouth, and covering her face
 53085	with her hands she burst into sobs.
 53086	
 53087	Princess Mary understood.
 53088	
 53089	But she still hoped, and asked, in words she herself did not trust:
 53090	
 53091	âBut how is his wound? What is his general condition?â
 53092	
 53093	âYou, you... will see,â was all NatÃ¡sha could say.
 53094	
 53095	They sat a little while downstairs near his room till they had left off
 53096	crying and were able to go to him with calm faces.
 53097	
 53098	âHow has his whole illness gone? Is it long since he grew worse? When
 53099	did this happen?â Princess Mary inquired.
 53100	
 53101	NatÃ¡sha told her that at first there had been danger from his feverish
 53102	condition and the pain he suffered, but at TrÃ³itsa that had passed
 53103	and the doctor had only been afraid of gangrene. That danger had also
 53104	passed. When they reached YaroslÃ¡vl the wound had begun to fester
 53105	(NatÃ¡sha knew all about such things as festering) and the doctor had
 53106	said that the festering might take a normal course. Then fever set in,
 53107	but the doctor had said the fever was not very serious.
 53108	
 53109	âBut two days ago this suddenly happened,â said NatÃ¡sha, struggling with
 53110	her sobs. âI donât know why, but you will see what he is like.â
 53111	
 53112	âIs he weaker? Thinner?â asked the princess.
 53113	
 53114	âNo, itâs not that, but worse. You will see. O, Mary, he is too good, he
 53115	cannot, cannot live, because...â
 53116	
 53117	
 53118	
 53119	
 53120	
 53121	CHAPTER XV
 53122	
 53123	When NatÃ¡sha opened Prince Andrewâs door with a familiar movement and
 53124	let Princess Mary pass into the room before her, the princess felt the
 53125	sobs in her throat. Hard as she had tried to prepare herself, and now
 53126	tried to remain tranquil, she knew that she would be unable to look at
 53127	him without tears.
 53128	
 53129	The princess understood what NatÃ¡sha had meant by the words: âtwo days
 53130	ago this suddenly happened.â She understood those words to mean that he
 53131	had suddenly softened and that this softening and gentleness were signs
 53132	of approaching death. As she stepped to the door she already saw in
 53133	imagination Andrewâs face as she remembered it in childhood, a gentle,
 53134	mild, sympathetic face which he had rarely shown, and which therefore
 53135	affected her very strongly. She was sure he would speak soft, tender
 53136	words to her such as her father had uttered before his death, and
 53137	that she would not be able to bear it and would burst into sobs in his
 53138	presence. Yet sooner or later it had to be, and she went in. The sobs
 53139	rose higher and higher in her throat as she more and more clearly
 53140	distinguished his form and her shortsighted eyes tried to make out his
 53141	features, and then she saw his face and met his gaze.
 53142	
 53143	He was lying in a squirrel-fur dressing gown on a divan, surrounded by
 53144	pillows. He was thin and pale. In one thin, translucently white hand
 53145	he held a handkerchief, while with the other he stroked the delicate
 53146	mustache he had grown, moving his fingers slowly. His eyes gazed at them
 53147	as they entered.
 53148	
 53149	On seeing his face and meeting his eyes Princess Maryâs pace suddenly
 53150	slackened, she felt her tears dry up and her sobs ceased. She suddenly
 53151	felt guilty and grew timid on catching the expression of his face and
 53152	eyes.
 53153	
 53154	âBut in what am I to blame?â she asked herself. And his cold, stern look
 53155	replied: âBecause you are alive and thinking of the living, while I...â
 53156	
 53157	In the deep gaze that seemed to look not outwards but inwards there
 53158	was an almost hostile expression as he slowly regarded his sister and
 53159	NatÃ¡sha.
 53160	
 53161	He kissed his sister, holding her hand in his as was their wont.
 53162	
 53163	âHow are you, Mary? How did you manage to get here?â said he in a voice
 53164	as calm and aloof as his look.
 53165	
 53166	Had he screamed in agony, that scream would not have struck such horror
 53167	into Princess Maryâs heart as the tone of his voice.
 53168	
 53169	âAnd have you brought little Nicholas?â he asked in the same slow, quiet
 53170	manner and with an obvious effort to remember.
 53171	
 53172	âHow are you now?â said Princess Mary, herself surprised at what she was
 53173	saying.
 53174	
 53175	âThat, my dear, you must ask the doctor,â he replied, and again making
 53176	an evident effort to be affectionate, he said with his lips only (his
 53177	words clearly did not correspond to his thoughts):
 53178	
 53179	âMerci, chÃ¨re amie, dâÃªtre venue.â *
 53180	
 53181	    * âThank you for coming, my dear.â
 53182	
 53183	
 53184	Princess Mary pressed his hand. The pressure made him wince just
 53185	perceptibly. He was silent, and she did not know what to say. She now
 53186	understood what had happened to him two days before. In his words, his
 53187	tone, and especially in that calm, almost antagonistic look could be
 53188	felt an estrangement from everything belonging to this world, terrible
 53189	in one who is alive. Evidently only with an effort did he understand
 53190	anything living; but it was obvious that he failed to understand, not
 53191	because he lacked the power to do so but because he understood something
 53192	elseâsomething the living did not and could not understandâand which
 53193	wholly occupied his mind.
 53194	
 53195	âThere, you see how strangely fate has brought us together,â said he,
 53196	breaking the silence and pointing to NatÃ¡sha. âShe looks after me all
 53197	the time.â
 53198	
 53199	Princess Mary heard him and did not understand how he could say such a
 53200	thing. He, the sensitive, tender Prince Andrew, how could he say that,
 53201	before her whom he loved and who loved him? Had he expected to live he
 53202	could not have said those words in that offensively cold tone. If he had
 53203	not known that he was dying, how could he have failed to pity her and
 53204	how could he speak like that in her presence? The only explanation was
 53205	that he was indifferent, because something else, much more important,
 53206	had been revealed to him.
 53207	
 53208	The conversation was cold and disconnected and continually broke off.
 53209	
 53210	âMary came by way of RyazÃ¡n,â said NatÃ¡sha.
 53211	
 53212	Prince Andrew did not notice that she called his sister Mary, and only
 53213	after calling her so in his presence did NatÃ¡sha notice it herself.
 53214	
 53215	âReally?â he asked.
 53216	
 53217	âThey told her that all Moscow has been burned down, and that...â
 53218	
 53219	NatÃ¡sha stopped. It was impossible to talk. It was plain that he was
 53220	making an effort to listen, but could not do so.
 53221	
 53222	âYes, they say itâs burned,â he said. âItâs a great pity,â and he gazed
 53223	straight before him, absently stroking his mustache with his fingers.
 53224	
 53225	âAnd so you have met Count Nicholas, Mary?â Prince Andrew suddenly said,
 53226	evidently wishing to speak pleasantly to them. âHe wrote here that he
 53227	took a great liking to you,â he went on simply and calmly, evidently
 53228	unable to understand all the complex significance his words had for
 53229	living people. âIf you liked him too, it would be a good thing for you
 53230	to get married,â he added rather more quickly, as if pleased at having
 53231	found words he had long been seeking.
 53232	
 53233	Princess Mary heard his words but they had no meaning for her, except as
 53234	a proof of how far away he now was from everything living.
 53235	
 53236	âWhy talk of me?â she said quietly and glanced at NatÃ¡sha.
 53237	
 53238	NatÃ¡sha, who felt her glance, did not look at her. All three were again
 53239	silent.
 53240	
 53241	âAndrew, would you like...â Princess Mary suddenly said in a trembling
 53242	voice, âwould you like to see little Nicholas? He is always talking
 53243	about you!â
 53244	
 53245	Prince Andrew smiled just perceptibly and for the first time, but
 53246	Princess Mary, who knew his face so well, saw with horror that he did
 53247	not smile with pleasure or affection for his son, but with quiet, gentle
 53248	irony because he thought she was trying what she believed to be the last
 53249	means of arousing him.
 53250	
 53251	âYes, I shall be very glad to see him. Is he quite well?â
 53252	
 53253	When little Nicholas was brought into Prince Andrewâs room he looked at
 53254	his father with frightened eyes, but did not cry, because no one else
 53255	was crying. Prince Andrew kissed him and evidently did not know what to
 53256	say to him.
 53257	
 53258	When Nicholas had been led away, Princess Mary again went up to her
 53259	brother, kissed him, and unable to restrain her tears any longer began
 53260	to cry.
 53261	
 53262	He looked at her attentively.
 53263	
 53264	âIs it about Nicholas?â he asked.
 53265	
 53266	Princess Mary nodded her head, weeping.
 53267	
 53268	âMary, you know the Gosp...â but he broke off.
 53269	
 53270	âWhat did you say?â
 53271	
 53272	âNothing. You mustnât cry here,â he said, looking at her with the same
 53273	cold expression.
 53274	
 53275	
 53276	When Princess Mary began to cry, he understood that she was crying at
 53277	the thought that little Nicholas would be left without a father. With
 53278	a great effort he tried to return to life and to see things from their
 53279	point of view.
 53280	
 53281	âYes, to them it must seem sad!â he thought. âBut how simple it is.
 53282	
 53283	âThe fowls of the air sow not, neither do they reap, yet your Father
 53284	feedeth them,â he said to himself and wished to say to Princess Mary;
 53285	âbut no, they will take it their own way, they wonât understand! They
 53286	canât understand that all those feelings they prize soâall our feelings,
 53287	all those ideas that seem so important to us, are unnecessary. We cannot
 53288	understand one another,â and he remained silent.
 53289	
 53290	
 53291	Prince Andrewâs little son was seven. He could scarcely read, and knew
 53292	nothing. After that day he lived through many things, gaining knowledge,
 53293	observation, and experience, but had he possessed all the faculties he
 53294	afterwards acquired, he could not have had a better or more profound
 53295	understanding of the meaning of the scene he had witnessed between
 53296	his father, Mary, and NatÃ¡sha, than he had then. He understood it
 53297	completely, and, leaving the room without crying, went silently up
 53298	to NatÃ¡sha who had come out with him and looked shyly at her with his
 53299	beautiful, thoughtful eyes, then his uplifted, rosy upper lip trembled
 53300	and leaning his head against her he began to cry.
 53301	
 53302	After that he avoided Dessalles and the countess who caressed him and
 53303	either sat alone or came timidly to Princess Mary, or to NatÃ¡sha of whom
 53304	he seemed even fonder than of his aunt, and clung to them quietly and
 53305	shyly.
 53306	
 53307	When Princess Mary had left Prince Andrew she fully understood what
 53308	NatÃ¡shaâs face had told her. She did not speak any more to NatÃ¡sha of
 53309	hopes of saving his life. She took turns with her beside his sofa, and
 53310	did not cry any more, but prayed continually, turning in soul to that
 53311	Eternal and Unfathomable, whose presence above the dying man was now so
 53312	evident.
 53313	
 53314	
 53315	
 53316	
 53317	
 53318	CHAPTER XVI
 53319	
 53320	Not only did Prince Andrew know he would die, but he felt that he was
 53321	dying and was already half dead. He was conscious of an aloofness from
 53322	everything earthly and a strange and joyous lightness of existence.
 53323	Without haste or agitation he awaited what was coming. That inexorable,
 53324	eternal, distant, and unknown the presence of which he had felt
 53325	continually all his lifeâwas now near to him and, by the strange
 53326	lightness he experienced, almost comprehensible and palpable....
 53327	
 53328	
 53329	Formerly he had feared the end. He had twice experienced that terribly
 53330	tormenting fear of deathâthe endâbut now he no longer understood that
 53331	fear.
 53332	
 53333	He had felt it for the first time when the shell spun like a top before
 53334	him, and he looked at the fallow field, the bushes, and the sky, and
 53335	knew that he was face to face with death. When he came to himself after
 53336	being wounded and the flower of eternal, unfettered love had instantly
 53337	unfolded itself in his soul as if freed from the bondage of life that
 53338	had restrained it, he no longer feared death and ceased to think about
 53339	it.
 53340	
 53341	During the hours of solitude, suffering, and partial delirium he
 53342	spent after he was wounded, the more deeply he penetrated into the new
 53343	principle of eternal love revealed to him, the more he unconsciously
 53344	detached himself from earthly life. To love everything and everybody and
 53345	always to sacrifice oneself for love meant not to love anyone, not
 53346	to live this earthly life. And the more imbued he became with that
 53347	principle of love, the more he renounced life and the more completely he
 53348	destroyed that dreadful barrier whichâin the absence of such loveâstands
 53349	between life and death. When during those first days he remembered that
 53350	he would have to die, he said to himself: âWell, what of it? So much the
 53351	better!â
 53352	
 53353	But after the night in MytÃ­shchi when, half delirious, he had seen her
 53354	for whom he longed appear before him and, having pressed her hand to his
 53355	lips, had shed gentle, happy tears, love for a particular woman again
 53356	crept unobserved into his heart and once more bound him to life. And
 53357	joyful and agitating thoughts began to occupy his mind. Recalling the
 53358	moment at the ambulance station when he had seen KurÃ¡gin, he could not
 53359	now regain the feeling he then had, but was tormented by the question
 53360	whether KurÃ¡gin was alive. And he dared not inquire.
 53361	
 53362	His illness pursued its normal physical course, but what NatÃ¡sha
 53363	referred to when she said: âThis suddenly happened,â had occurred two
 53364	days before Princess Mary arrived. It was the last spiritual struggle
 53365	between life and death, in which death gained the victory. It was
 53366	the unexpected realization of the fact that he still valued life as
 53367	presented to him in the form of his love for NatÃ¡sha, and a last, though
 53368	ultimately vanquished, attack of terror before the unknown.
 53369	
 53370	It was evening. As usual after dinner he was slightly feverish, and his
 53371	thoughts were preternaturally clear. SÃ³nya was sitting by the table. He
 53372	began to doze. Suddenly a feeling of happiness seized him.
 53373	
 53374	âAh, she has come!â thought he.
 53375	
 53376	And so it was: in SÃ³nyaâs place sat NatÃ¡sha who had just come in
 53377	noiselessly.
 53378	
 53379	Since she had begun looking after him, he had always experienced this
 53380	physical consciousness of her nearness. She was sitting in an armchair
 53381	placed sideways, screening the light of the candle from him, and was
 53382	knitting a stocking. She had learned to knit stockings since Prince
 53383	Andrew had casually mentioned that no one nursed the sick so well as old
 53384	nurses who knit stockings, and that there is something soothing in
 53385	the knitting of stockings. The needles clicked lightly in her slender,
 53386	rapidly moving hands, and he could clearly see the thoughtful profile
 53387	of her drooping face. She moved, and the ball rolled off her knees. She
 53388	started, glanced round at him, and screening the candle with her hand
 53389	stooped carefully with a supple and exact movement, picked up the ball,
 53390	and regained her former position.
 53391	
 53392	He looked at her without moving and saw that she wanted to draw a
 53393	deep breath after stooping, but refrained from doing so and breathed
 53394	cautiously.
 53395	
 53396	At the TrÃ³itsa monastery they had spoken of the past, and he had told
 53397	her that if he lived he would always thank God for his wound which had
 53398	brought them together again, but after that they never spoke of the
 53399	future.
 53400	
 53401	âCan it or can it not be?â he now thought as he looked at her and
 53402	listened to the light click of the steel needles. âCan fate have brought
 53403	me to her so strangely only for me to die?... Is it possible that the
 53404	truth of life has been revealed to me only to show me that I have spent
 53405	my life in falsity? I love her more than anything in the world! But what
 53406	am I to do if I love her?â he thought, and he involuntarily groaned,
 53407	from a habit acquired during his sufferings.
 53408	
 53409	On hearing that sound NatÃ¡sha put down the stocking, leaned nearer to
 53410	him, and suddenly, noticing his shining eyes, stepped lightly up to him
 53411	and bent over him.
 53412	
 53413	âYou are not asleep?â
 53414	
 53415	âNo, I have been looking at you a long time. I felt you come in. No one
 53416	else gives me that sense of soft tranquillity that you do... that light.
 53417	I want to weep for joy.â
 53418	
 53419	NatÃ¡sha drew closer to him. Her face shone with rapturous joy.
 53420	
 53421	âNatÃ¡sha, I love you too much! More than anything in the world.â
 53422	
 53423	âAnd I!ââShe turned away for an instant. âWhy too much?â she asked.
 53424	
 53425	âWhy too much?... Well, what do you, what do you feel in your soul, your
 53426	whole soulâshall I live? What do you think?â
 53427	
 53428	âI am sure of it, sure!â NatÃ¡sha almost shouted, taking hold of both his
 53429	hands with a passionate movement.
 53430	
 53431	He remained silent awhile.
 53432	
 53433	âHow good it would be!â and taking her hand he kissed it.
 53434	
 53435	NatÃ¡sha felt happy and agitated, but at once remembered that this would
 53436	not do and that he had to be quiet.
 53437	
 53438	âBut you have not slept,â she said, repressing her joy. âTry to sleep...
 53439	please!â
 53440	
 53441	He pressed her hand and released it, and she went back to the candle and
 53442	sat down again in her former position. Twice she turned and looked at
 53443	him, and her eyes met his beaming at her. She set herself a task on her
 53444	stocking and resolved not to turn round till it was finished.
 53445	
 53446	Soon he really shut his eyes and fell asleep. He did not sleep long and
 53447	suddenly awoke with a start and in a cold perspiration.
 53448	
 53449	As he fell asleep he had still been thinking of the subject that now
 53450	always occupied his mindâabout life and death, and chiefly about death.
 53451	He felt himself nearer to it.
 53452	
 53453	âLove? What is love?â he thought.
 53454	
 53455	âLove hinders death. Love is life. All, everything that I understand, I
 53456	understand only because I love. Everything is, everything exists, only
 53457	because I love. Everything is united by it alone. Love is God, and to
 53458	die means that I, a particle of love, shall return to the general and
 53459	eternal source.â These thoughts seemed to him comforting. But they were
 53460	only thoughts. Something was lacking in them, they were not clear, they
 53461	were too one-sidedly personal and brain-spun. And there was the former
 53462	agitation and obscurity. He fell asleep.
 53463	
 53464	He dreamed that he was lying in the room he really was in, but that
 53465	he was quite well and unwounded. Many various, indifferent, and
 53466	insignificant people appeared before him. He talked to them and
 53467	discussed something trivial. They were preparing to go away somewhere.
 53468	Prince Andrew dimly realized that all this was trivial and that he had
 53469	more important cares, but he continued to speak, surprising them by
 53470	empty witticisms. Gradually, unnoticed, all these persons began to
 53471	disappear and a single question, that of the closed door, superseded
 53472	all else. He rose and went to the door to bolt and lock it. Everything
 53473	depended on whether he was, or was not, in time to lock it. He went, and
 53474	tried to hurry, but his legs refused to move and he knew he would not be
 53475	in time to lock the door though he painfully strained all his powers. He
 53476	was seized by an agonizing fear. And that fear was the fear of death. It
 53477	stood behind the door. But just when he was clumsily creeping toward
 53478	the door, that dreadful something on the other side was already pressing
 53479	against it and forcing its way in. Something not humanâdeathâwas
 53480	breaking in through that door, and had to be kept out. He seized the
 53481	door, making a final effort to hold it backâto lock it was no longer
 53482	possibleâbut his efforts were weak and clumsy and the door, pushed from
 53483	behind by that terror, opened and closed again.
 53484	
 53485	Once again it pushed from outside. His last superhuman efforts were vain
 53486	and both halves of the door noiselessly opened. It entered, and it was
 53487	death, and Prince Andrew died.
 53488	
 53489	But at the instant he died, Prince Andrew remembered that he was asleep,
 53490	and at the very instant he died, having made an effort, he awoke.
 53491	
 53492	âYes, it was death! I diedâand woke up. Yes, death is an awakening!â And
 53493	all at once it grew light in his soul and the veil that had till then
 53494	concealed the unknown was lifted from his spiritual vision. He felt as
 53495	if powers till then confined within him had been liberated, and that
 53496	strange lightness did not again leave him.
 53497	
 53498	When, waking in a cold perspiration, he moved on the divan, NatÃ¡sha went
 53499	up and asked him what was the matter. He did not answer and looked at
 53500	her strangely, not understanding.
 53501	
 53502	That was what had happened to him two days before Princess Maryâs
 53503	arrival. From that day, as the doctor expressed it, the wasting fever
 53504	assumed a malignant character, but what the doctor said did not interest
 53505	NatÃ¡sha, she saw the terrible moral symptoms which to her were more
 53506	convincing.
 53507	
 53508	From that day an awakening from life came to Prince Andrew together with
 53509	his awakening from sleep. And compared to the duration of life it did
 53510	not seem to him slower than an awakening from sleep compared to the
 53511	duration of a dream.
 53512	
 53513	There was nothing terrible or violent in this comparatively slow
 53514	awakening.
 53515	
 53516	His last days and hours passed in an ordinary and simple way. Both
 53517	Princess Mary and NatÃ¡sha, who did not leave him, felt this. They did
 53518	not weep or shudder and during these last days they themselves felt
 53519	that they were not attending on him (he was no longer there, he had left
 53520	them) but on what reminded them most closely of himâhis body. Both felt
 53521	this so strongly that the outward and terrible side of death did not
 53522	affect them and they did not feel it necessary to foment their grief.
 53523	Neither in his presence nor out of it did they weep, nor did they ever
 53524	talk to one another about him. They felt that they could not express in
 53525	words what they understood.
 53526	
 53527	They both saw that he was sinking slowly and quietly, deeper and deeper,
 53528	away from them, and they both knew that this had to be so and that it
 53529	was right.
 53530	
 53531	He confessed, and received communion: everyone came to take leave of
 53532	him. When they brought his son to him, he pressed his lips to the boyâs
 53533	and turned away, not because he felt it hard and sad (Princess Mary and
 53534	NatÃ¡sha understood that) but simply because he thought it was all that
 53535	was required of him, but when they told him to bless the boy, he did
 53536	what was demanded and looked round as if asking whether there was
 53537	anything else he should do.
 53538	
 53539	When the last convulsions of the body, which the spirit was leaving,
 53540	occurred, Princess Mary and NatÃ¡sha were present.
 53541	
 53542	âIs it over?â said Princess Mary when his body had for a few minutes
 53543	lain motionless, growing cold before them. NatÃ¡sha went up, looked at
 53544	the dead eyes, and hastened to close them. She closed them but did not
 53545	kiss them, but clung to that which reminded her most nearly of himâhis
 53546	body.
 53547	
 53548	âWhere has he gone? Where is he now?...â
 53549	
 53550	When the body, washed and dressed, lay in the coffin on a table,
 53551	everyone came to take leave of him and they all wept.
 53552	
 53553	Little Nicholas cried because his heart was rent by painful perplexity.
 53554	The countess and SÃ³nya cried from pity for NatÃ¡sha and because he was
 53555	no more. The old count cried because he felt that before long, he, too,
 53556	must take the same terrible step.
 53557	
 53558	NatÃ¡sha and Princess Mary also wept now, but not because of their own
 53559	personal grief; they wept with a reverent and softening emotion which
 53560	had taken possession of their souls at the consciousness of the
 53561	simple and solemn mystery of death that had been accomplished in their
 53562	presence.

 53573	
 53574	CHAPTER I
 53575	
 53576	Manâs mind cannot grasp the causes of events in their completeness, but
 53577	the desire to find those causes is implanted in manâs soul. And without
 53578	considering the multiplicity and complexity of the conditions any one
 53579	of which taken separately may seem to be the cause, he snatches at the
 53580	first approximation to a cause that seems to him intelligible and says:
 53581	âThis is the cause!â In historical events (where the actions of men are
 53582	the subject of observation) the first and most primitive approximation
 53583	to present itself was the will of the gods and, after that, the will of
 53584	those who stood in the most prominent positionâthe heroes of history.
 53585	But we need only penetrate to the essence of any historic eventâwhich
 53586	lies in the activity of the general mass of men who take part in itâto
 53587	be convinced that the will of the historic hero does not control the
 53588	actions of the mass but is itself continually controlled. It may seem
 53589	to be a matter of indifference whether we understand the meaning of
 53590	historical events this way or that; yet there is the same difference
 53591	between a man who says that the people of the West moved on the East
 53592	because Napoleon wished it and a man who says that this happened because
 53593	it had to happen, as there is between those who declared that the
 53594	earth was stationary and that the planets moved round it and those who
 53595	admitted that they did not know what upheld the earth, but knew there
 53596	were laws directing its movement and that of the other planets. There
 53597	is, and can be, no cause of an historical event except the one cause of
 53598	all causes. But there are laws directing events, and some of these laws
 53599	are known to us while we are conscious of others we cannot comprehend.
 53600	The discovery of these laws is only possible when we have quite
 53601	abandoned the attempt to find the cause in the will of some one man,
 53602	just as the discovery of the laws of the motion of the planets was
 53603	possible only when men abandoned the conception of the fixity of the
 53604	earth.
 53605	
 53606	The historians consider that, next to the battle of BorodinÃ³ and the
 53607	occupation of Moscow by the enemy and its destruction by fire, the most
 53608	important episode of the war of 1812 was the movement of the Russian
 53609	army from the RyazÃ¡na to the KalÃºga road and to the TarÃºtino campâthe
 53610	so-called flank march across the KrÃ¡snaya PakhrÃ¡ River. They ascribe the
 53611	glory of that achievement of genius to different men and dispute as to
 53612	whom the honor is due. Even foreign historians, including the French,
 53613	acknowledge the genius of the Russian commanders when they speak of
 53614	that flank march. But it is hard to understand why military writers,
 53615	and following them others, consider this flank march to be the profound
 53616	conception of some one man who saved Russia and destroyed Napoleon. In
 53617	the first place it is hard to understand where the profundity and genius
 53618	of this movement lay, for not much mental effort was needed to see that
 53619	the best position for an army when it is not being attacked is where
 53620	there are most provisions; and even a dull boy of thirteen could have
 53621	guessed that the best position for an army after its retreat from Moscow
 53622	in 1812 was on the KalÃºga road. So it is impossible to understand by
 53623	what reasoning the historians reach the conclusion that this maneuver
 53624	was a profound one. And it is even more difficult to understand just why
 53625	they think that this maneuver was calculated to save Russia and destroy
 53626	the French; for this flank march, had it been preceded, accompanied,
 53627	or followed by other circumstances, might have proved ruinous to the
 53628	Russians and salutary for the French. If the position of the Russian
 53629	army really began to improve from the time of that march, it does not at
 53630	all follow that the march was the cause of it.
 53631	
 53632	That flank march might not only have failed to give any advantage to
 53633	the Russian army, but might in other circumstances have led to its
 53634	destruction. What would have happened had Moscow not burned down? If
 53635	Murat had not lost sight of the Russians? If Napoleon had not remained
 53636	inactive? If the Russian army at KrÃ¡snaya PakhrÃ¡ had given battle as
 53637	Bennigsen and Barclay advised? What would have happened had the French
 53638	attacked the Russians while they were marching beyond the PakhrÃ¡? What
 53639	would have happened if on approaching TarÃºtino, Napoleon had attacked
 53640	the Russians with but a tenth of the energy he had shown when he
 53641	attacked them at SmolÃ©nsk? What would have happened had the French moved
 53642	on Petersburg?... In any of these eventualities the flank march that
 53643	brought salvation might have proved disastrous.
 53644	
 53645	The third and most incomprehensible thing is that people studying
 53646	history deliberately avoid seeing that this flank march cannot be
 53647	attributed to any one man, that no one ever foresaw it, and that in
 53648	reality, like the retreat from FilÃ­, it did not suggest itself to anyone
 53649	in its entirety, but resultedâmoment by moment, step by step, event by
 53650	eventâfrom an endless number of most diverse circumstances and was only
 53651	seen in its entirety when it had been accomplished and belonged to the
 53652	past.
 53653	
 53654	At the council at FilÃ­ the prevailing thought in the minds of the
 53655	Russian commanders was the one naturally suggesting itself, namely, a
 53656	direct retreat by the NÃ­zhni road. In proof of this there is the fact
 53657	that the majority of the council voted for such a retreat, and above
 53658	all there is the well-known conversation after the council, between the
 53659	commander in chief and LanskÃ³y, who was in charge of the commissariat
 53660	department. LanskÃ³y informed the commander in chief that the army
 53661	supplies were for the most part stored along the OkÃ¡ in the TÃºla and
 53662	RyazÃ¡n provinces, and that if they retreated on NÃ­zhni the army would
 53663	be separated from its supplies by the broad river OkÃ¡, which cannot be
 53664	crossed early in winter. This was the first indication of the necessity
 53665	of deviating from what had previously seemed the most natural courseâa
 53666	direct retreat on NÃ­zhni-NÃ³vgorod. The army turned more to the south,
 53667	along the RyazÃ¡n road and nearer to its supplies. Subsequently the
 53668	inactivity of the French (who even lost sight of the Russian army),
 53669	concern for the safety of the arsenal at TÃºla, and especially the
 53670	advantages of drawing nearer to its supplies caused the army to turn
 53671	still further south to the TÃºla road. Having crossed over, by a forced
 53672	march, to the TÃºla road beyond the PakhrÃ¡, the Russian commanders
 53673	intended to remain at PodÃ³lsk and had no thought of the TarÃºtino
 53674	position; but innumerable circumstances and the reappearance of French
 53675	troops who had for a time lost touch with the Russians, and projects
 53676	of giving battle, and above all the abundance of provisions in KalÃºga
 53677	province, obliged our army to turn still more to the south and to cross
 53678	from the TÃºla to the KalÃºga road and go to TarÃºtino, which was between
 53679	the roads along which those supplies lay. Just as it is impossible to
 53680	say when it was decided to abandon Moscow, so it is impossible to say
 53681	precisely when, or by whom, it was decided to move to TarÃºtino. Only
 53682	when the army had got there, as the result of innumerable and varying
 53683	forces, did people begin to assure themselves that they had desired this
 53684	movement and long ago foreseen its result.
 53685	
 53686	
 53687	
 53688	
 53689	
 53690	CHAPTER II
 53691	
 53692	The famous flank movement merely consisted in this: after the advance
 53693	of the French had ceased, the Russian army, which had been continually
 53694	retreating straight back from the invaders, deviated from that direct
 53695	course and, not finding itself pursued, was naturally drawn toward the
 53696	district where supplies were abundant.
 53697	
 53698	If instead of imagining to ourselves commanders of genius leading the
 53699	Russian army, we picture that army without any leaders, it could not
 53700	have done anything but make a return movement toward Moscow, describing
 53701	an arc in the direction where most provisions were to be found and where
 53702	the country was richest.
 53703	
 53704	That movement from the NÃ­zhni to the RyazÃ¡n, TÃºla, and KalÃºga roads was
 53705	so natural that even the Russian marauders moved in that direction, and
 53706	demands were sent from Petersburg for KutÃºzov to take his army that
 53707	way. At TarÃºtino KutÃºzov received what was almost a reprimand from
 53708	the Emperor for having moved his army along the RyazÃ¡n road, and the
 53709	Emperorâs letter indicated to him the very position he had already
 53710	occupied near KalÃºga.
 53711	
 53712	Having rolled like a ball in the direction of the impetus given by the
 53713	whole campaign and by the battle of BorodinÃ³, the Russian armyâwhen
 53714	the strength of that impetus was exhausted and no fresh push was
 53715	receivedâassumed the position natural to it.
 53716	
 53717	KutÃºzovâs merit lay, not in any strategic maneuver of genius, as it is
 53718	called, but in the fact that he alone understood the significance of
 53719	what had happened. He alone then understood the meaning of the French
 53720	armyâs inactivity, he alone continued to assert that the battle of
 53721	BorodinÃ³ had been a victory, he aloneâwho as commander in chief might
 53722	have been expected to be eager to attackâemployed his whole strength to
 53723	restrain the Russian army from useless engagements.
 53724	
 53725	The beast wounded at BorodinÃ³ was lying where the fleeing hunter had
 53726	left him; but whether he was still alive, whether he was strong and
 53727	merely lying low, the hunter did not know. Suddenly the beast was heard
 53728	to moan.
 53729	
 53730	The moan of that wounded beast (the French army) which betrayed its
 53731	calamitous condition was the sending of Lauriston to KutÃºzovâs camp with
 53732	overtures for peace.
 53733	
 53734	Napoleon, with his usual assurance that whatever entered his head was
 53735	right, wrote to KutÃºzov the first words that occurred to him, though
 53736	they were meaningless.
 53737	
 53738	
 53739	MONSIEUR LE PRINCE KOUTOUZOV: I am sending one of my adjutants-general
 53740	to discuss several interesting questions with you. I beg your Highness
 53741	to credit what he says to you, especially when he expresses the
 53742	sentiment of esteem and special regard I have long entertained for your
 53743	person. This letter having no other object, I pray God, monsieur le
 53744	prince Koutouzov, to keep you in His holy and gracious protection!

 53747	
 53748	MOSCOW, OCTOBER 30, 1812
 53749	
 53750	
 53751	KutÃºzov replied: âI should be cursed by posterity were I looked on as
 53752	the initiator of a settlement of any sort. Such is the present spirit
 53753	of my nation.â But he continued to exert all his powers to restrain his
 53754	troops from attacking.
 53755	
 53756	During the month that the French troops were pillaging in Moscow and
 53757	the Russian troops were quietly encamped at TarÃºtino, a change had taken
 53758	place in the relative strength of the two armiesâboth in spirit and in
 53759	numberâas a result of which the superiority had passed to the Russian
 53760	side. Though the condition and numbers of the French army were unknown
 53761	to the Russians, as soon as that change occurred the need of attacking
 53762	at once showed itself by countless signs. These signs were: Lauristonâs
 53763	mission; the abundance of provisions at TarÃºtino; the reports coming in
 53764	from all sides of the inactivity and disorder of the French; the flow of
 53765	recruits to our regiments; the fine weather; the long rest the Russian
 53766	soldiers had enjoyed, and the impatience to do what they had been
 53767	assembled for, which usually shows itself in an army that has been
 53768	resting; curiosity as to what the French army, so long lost sight of,
 53769	was doing; the boldness with which our outposts now scouted close up to
 53770	the French stationed at TarÃºtino; the news of easy successes gained by
 53771	peasants and guerrilla troops over the French, the envy aroused by this;
 53772	the desire for revenge that lay in the heart of every Russian as long as
 53773	the French were in Moscow, and (above all) a dim consciousness in every
 53774	soldierâs mind that the relative strength of the armies had changed and
 53775	that the advantage was now on our side. There was a substantial change
 53776	in the relative strength, and an advance had become inevitable. And at
 53777	once, as a clock begins to strike and chime as soon as the minute hand
 53778	has completed a full circle, this change was shown by an increased
 53779	activity, whirring, and chiming in the higher spheres.

 53784	
 53785	CHAPTER III
 53786	
 53787	The Russian army was commanded by KutÃºzov and his staff, and also by the
 53788	Emperor from Petersburg. Before the news of the abandonment of Moscow
 53789	had been received in Petersburg, a detailed plan of the whole campaign
 53790	had been drawn up and sent to KutÃºzov for his guidance. Though this plan
 53791	had been drawn up on the supposition that Moscow was still in our hands,
 53792	it was approved by the staff and accepted as a basis for action.
 53793	KutÃºzov only replied that movements arranged from a distance were always
 53794	difficult to execute. So fresh instructions were sent for the solution
 53795	of difficulties that might be encountered, as well as fresh people who
 53796	were to watch KutÃºzovâs actions and report upon them.
 53797	
 53798	Besides this, the whole staff of the Russian army was now reorganized.
 53799	The posts left vacant by BagratiÃ³n, who had been killed, and by
 53800	Barclay, who had gone away in dudgeon, had to be filled. Very serious
 53801	consideration was given to the question whether it would be better to
 53802	put A in Bâs place and B in Dâs, or on the contrary to put D in Aâs
 53803	place, and so onâas if anything more than Aâs or Bâs satisfaction
 53804	depended on this.
 53805	
 53806	As a result of the hostility between KutÃºzov and Bennigsen, his Chief of
 53807	Staff, the presence of confidential representatives of the Emperor, and
 53808	these transfers, a more than usually complicated play of parties
 53809	was going on among the staff of the army. A was undermining B, D was
 53810	undermining C, and so on in all possible combinations and permutations.
 53811	In all these plottings the subject of intrigue was generally the conduct
 53812	of the war, which all these men believed they were directing; but this
 53813	affair of the war went on independently of them, as it had to go:
 53814	that is, never in the way people devised, but flowing always from the
 53815	essential attitude of the masses. Only in the highest spheres did
 53816	all these schemes, crossings, and interminglings appear to be a true
 53817	reflection of what had to happen.
 53818	
 53819	
 53820	Prince Michael IlariÃ³novich! (wrote the Emperor on the second of October
 53821	in a letter that reached KutÃºzov after the battle at TarÃºtino) Since
 53822	September 2 Moscow has been in the hands of the enemy. Your last reports
 53823	were written on the twentieth, and during all this time not only has
 53824	no action been taken against the enemy or for the relief of the ancient
 53825	capital, but according to your last report you have even retreated
 53826	farther. SÃ©rpukhov is already occupied by an enemy detachment and TÃºla
 53827	with its famous arsenal so indispensable to the army, is in danger.
 53828	From General Wintzingerodeâs reports, I see that an enemy corps of ten
 53829	thousand men is moving on the Petersburg road. Another corps of several
 53830	thousand men is moving on DmÃ­trov. A third has advanced along the
 53831	VladÃ­mir road, and a fourth, rather considerable detachment is stationed
 53832	between RÃºza and MozhÃ¡ysk. Napoleon himself was in Moscow as late as
 53833	the twenty-fifth. In view of all this information, when the enemy has
 53834	scattered his forces in large detachments, and with Napoleon and his
 53835	Guards in Moscow, is it possible that the enemyâs forces confronting you
 53836	are so considerable as not to allow of your taking the offensive? On the
 53837	contrary, he is probably pursuing you with detachments, or at most with
 53838	an army corps much weaker than the army entrusted to you. It would seem
 53839	that, availing yourself of these circumstances, you might advantageously
 53840	attack a weaker one and annihilate him, or at least oblige him to
 53841	retreat, retaining in our hands an important part of the provinces now
 53842	occupied by the enemy, and thereby averting danger from TÃºla and other
 53843	towns in the interior. You will be responsible if the enemy is able to
 53844	direct a force of any size against Petersburg to threaten this capital
 53845	in which it has not been possible to retain many troops; for with the
 53846	army entrusted to you, and acting with resolution and energy, you have
 53847	ample means to avert this fresh calamity. Remember that you have still
 53848	to answer to our offended country for the loss of Moscow. You have
 53849	experienced my readiness to reward you. That readiness will not weaken
 53850	in me, but I and Russia have a right to expect from you all the zeal,
 53851	firmness, and success which your intellect, military talent, and the
 53852	courage of the troops you command justify us in expecting.
 53853	
 53854	
 53855	But by the time this letter, which proved that the real relation of
 53856	the forces had already made itself felt in Petersburg, was dispatched,
 53857	KutÃºzov had found himself unable any longer to restrain the army he
 53858	commanded from attacking and a battle had taken place.
 53859	
 53860	On the second of October a Cossack, ShapovÃ¡lov, who was out scouting,
 53861	killed one hare and wounded another. Following the wounded hare he made
 53862	his way far into the forest and came upon the left flank of Muratâs
 53863	army, encamped there without any precautions. The Cossack laughingly
 53864	told his comrades how he had almost fallen into the hands of the French.
 53865	A cornet, hearing the story, informed his commander.
 53866	
 53867	The Cossack was sent for and questioned. The Cossack officers wished
 53868	to take advantage of this chance to capture some horses, but one of
 53869	the superior officers, who was acquainted with the higher authorities,
 53870	reported the incident to a general on the staff. The state of things on
 53871	the staff had of late been exceedingly strained. ErmÃ³lov had been to
 53872	see Bennigsen a few days previously and had entreated him to use
 53873	his influence with the commander in chief to induce him to take the
 53874	offensive.
 53875	
 53876	âIf I did not know you I should think you did not want what you are
 53877	asking for. I need only advise anything and his Highness is sure to do
 53878	the opposite,â replied Bennigsen.
 53879	
 53880	The Cossackâs report, confirmed by horse patrols who were sent out, was
 53881	the final proof that events had matured. The tightly coiled spring was
 53882	released, the clock began to whirr and the chimes to play. Despite all
 53883	his supposed power, his intellect, his experience, and his knowledge
 53884	of men, KutÃºzovâhaving taken into consideration the Cossackâs report, a
 53885	note from Bennigsen who sent personal reports to the Emperor, the wishes
 53886	he supposed the Emperor to hold, and the fact that all the generals
 53887	expressed the same wishâcould no longer check the inevitable movement,
 53888	and gave the order to do what he regarded as useless and harmfulâgave
 53889	his approval, that is, to the accomplished fact.
 53890	
 53891	
 53892	
 53893	
 53894	
 53895	CHAPTER IV
 53896	
 53897	Bennigsenâs note and the Cossackâs information that the left flank
 53898	of the French was unguarded were merely final indications that it was
 53899	necessary to order an attack, and it was fixed for the fifth of October.
 53900	
 53901	On the morning of the fourth of October KutÃºzov signed the dispositions.
 53902	Toll read them to ErmÃ³lov, asking him to attend to the further
 53903	arrangements.
 53904	
 53905	âAll rightâall right. I havenât time just now,â replied ErmÃ³lov, and
 53906	left the hut.
 53907	
 53908	The dispositions drawn up by Toll were very good. As in the Austerlitz
 53909	dispositions, it was writtenâthough not in German this time:
 53910	
 53911	âThe First Column will march here and here,â âthe Second Column will
 53912	march there and there,â and so on; and on paper, all these columns
 53913	arrived at their places at the appointed time and destroyed the enemy.
 53914	Everything had been admirably thought out as is usual in dispositions,
 53915	and as is always the case, not a single column reached its place at the
 53916	appointed time.
 53917	
 53918	When the necessary number of copies of the dispositions had been
 53919	prepared, an officer was summoned and sent to deliver them to ErmÃ³lov
 53920	to deal with. A young officer of the Horse Guards, KutÃºzovâs orderly,
 53921	pleased at the importance of the mission entrusted to him, went to
 53922	ErmÃ³lovâs quarters.
 53923	
 53924	âGone away,â said ErmÃ³lovâs orderly.
 53925	
 53926	The officer of the Horse Guards went to a general with whom ErmÃ³lov was
 53927	often to be found.
 53928	
 53929	âNo, and the generalâs out too.â
 53930	
 53931	The officer, mounting his horse, rode off to someone else.
 53932	
 53933	âNo, heâs gone out.â
 53934	
 53935	âIf only they donât make me responsible for this delay! What a nuisance
 53936	it is!â thought the officer, and he rode round the whole camp. One man
 53937	said he had seen ErmÃ³lov ride past with some other generals, others said
 53938	he must have returned home. The officer searched till six oâclock in the
 53939	evening without even stopping to eat. ErmÃ³lov was nowhere to be found
 53940	and no one knew where he was. The officer snatched a little food at
 53941	a comradeâs, and rode again to the vanguard to find MilorÃ¡dovich.
 53942	MilorÃ¡dovich too was away, but here he was told that he had gone to a
 53943	ball at General KÃ­kinâs and that ErmÃ³lov was probably there too.
 53944	
 53945	âBut where is it?â
 53946	
 53947	âWhy, there, over at Ãchkino,â said a Cossack officer, pointing to a
 53948	country house in the far distance.
 53949	
 53950	âWhat, outside our line?â
 53951	
 53952	âTheyâve put two regiments as outposts, and theyâre having such a spree
 53953	there, itâs awful! Two bands and three sets of singers!â
 53954	
 53955	The officer rode out beyond our lines to Ãchkino. While still at a
 53956	distance he heard as he rode the merry sounds of a soldierâs dance song
 53957	proceeding from the house.
 53958	
 53959	âIn the meadows... in the meadows!â he heard, accompanied by whistling
 53960	and the sound of a torban, drowned every now and then by shouts. These
 53961	sounds made his spirits rise, but at the same time he was afraid that
 53962	he would be blamed for not having executed sooner the important order
 53963	entrusted to him. It was already past eight oâclock. He dismounted
 53964	and went up into the porch of a large country house which had remained
 53965	intact between the Russian and French forces. In the refreshment room
 53966	and the hall, footmen were bustling about with wine and viands. Groups
 53967	of singers stood outside the windows. The officer was admitted and
 53968	immediately saw all the chief generals of the army together, and among
 53969	them ErmÃ³lovâs big imposing figure. They all had their coats unbuttoned
 53970	and were standing in a semicircle with flushed and animated faces,
 53971	laughing loudly. In the middle of the room a short handsome general with
 53972	a red face was dancing the trepÃ¡k with much spirit and agility.
 53973	
 53974	âHa, ha, ha! Bravo, Nicholas IvÃ¡nych! Ha, ha, ha!â
 53975	
 53976	The officer felt that by arriving with important orders at such a moment
 53977	he was doubly to blame, and he would have preferred to wait; but one of
 53978	the generals espied him and, hearing what he had come about, informed
 53979	ErmÃ³lov.
 53980	
 53981	ErmÃ³lov came forward with a frown on his face and, hearing what the
 53982	officer had to say, took the papers from him without a word.
 53983	
 53984	
 53985	âYou think he went off just by chance?â said a comrade, who was on the
 53986	staff that evening, to the officer of the Horse Guards, referring to
 53987	ErmÃ³lov. âIt was a trick. It was done on purpose to get KonovnÃ­tsyn into
 53988	trouble. Youâll see what a mess thereâll be tomorrow.â
 53989	
 53990	
 53991	
 53992	
 53993	
 53994	CHAPTER V
 53995	
 53996	Next day the decrepit KutÃºzov, having given orders to be called early,
 53997	said his prayers, dressed, and, with an unpleasant consciousness of
 53998	having to direct a battle he did not approve of, got into his calÃ¨che
 53999	and drove from LetashÃ³vka (a village three and a half miles from
 54000	TarÃºtino) to the place where the attacking columns were to meet. He sat
 54001	in the calÃ¨che, dozing and waking up by turns, and listening for any
 54002	sound of firing on the right as an indication that the action had begun.
 54003	But all was still quiet. A damp dull autumn morning was just dawning. On
 54004	approaching TarÃºtino KutÃºzov noticed cavalrymen leading their horses to
 54005	water across the road along which he was driving. KutÃºzov looked at
 54006	them searchingly, stopped his carriage, and inquired what regiment they
 54007	belonged to. They belonged to a column that should have been far in
 54008	front and in ambush long before then. âIt may be a mistake,â thought
 54009	the old commander in chief. But a little further on he saw infantry
 54010	regiments with their arms piled and the soldiers, only partly dressed,
 54011	eating their rye porridge and carrying fuel. He sent for an officer. The
 54012	officer reported that no order to advance had been received.
 54013	
 54014	âHow! Not rec...â KutÃºzov began, but checked himself immediately and
 54015	sent for a senior officer. Getting out of his calÃ¨che, he waited with
 54016	drooping head and breathing heavily, pacing silently up and down. When
 54017	EÃ½khen, the officer of the general staff whom he had summoned, appeared,
 54018	KutÃºzov went purple in the face, not because that officer was to blame
 54019	for the mistake, but because he was an object of sufficient importance
 54020	for him to vent his wrath on. Trembling and panting the old man fell
 54021	into that state of fury in which he sometimes used to roll on the
 54022	ground, and he fell upon EÃ½khen, threatening him with his hands,
 54023	shouting and loading him with gross abuse. Another man, Captain BrÃ³zin,
 54024	who happened to turn up and who was not at all to blame, suffered the
 54025	same fate.
 54026	
 54027	âWhat sort of another blackguard are you? Iâll have you shot!
 54028	Scoundrels!â yelled KutÃºzov in a hoarse voice, waving his arms and
 54029	reeling.
 54030	
 54031	He was suffering physically. He, the commander in chief, a Serene
 54032	Highness who everybody said possessed powers such as no man had ever had
 54033	in Russia, to be placed in this positionâmade the laughingstock of the
 54034	whole army! âI neednât have been in such a hurry to pray about today,
 54035	or have kept awake thinking everything over all night,â thought he to
 54036	himself. âWhen I was a chit of an officer no one would have dared to
 54037	mock me so... and now!â He was in a state of physical suffering as if
 54038	from corporal punishment, and could not avoid expressing it by cries of
 54039	anger and distress. But his strength soon began to fail him, and looking
 54040	about him, conscious of having said much that was amiss, he again got
 54041	into his calÃ¨che and drove back in silence.
 54042	
 54043	His wrath, once expended, did not return, and blinking feebly he
 54044	listened to excuses and self-justifications (ErmÃ³lov did not come to see
 54045	him till the next day) and to the insistence of Bennigsen, KonovnÃ­tsyn,
 54046	and Toll that the movement that had miscarried should be executed next
 54047	day. And once more KutÃºzov had to consent.
 54048	
 54049	
 54050	
 54051	
 54052	
 54053	CHAPTER VI
 54054	
 54055	Next day the troops assembled in their appointed places in the evening
 54056	and advanced during the night. It was an autumn night with dark purple
 54057	clouds, but no rain. The ground was damp but not muddy, and the troops
 54058	advanced noiselessly, only occasionally a jingling of the artillery
 54059	could be faintly heard. The men were forbidden to talk out loud, to
 54060	smoke their pipes, or to strike a light, and they tried to prevent their
 54061	horses neighing. The secrecy of the undertaking heightened its charm
 54062	and they marched gaily. Some columns, supposing they had reached their
 54063	destination, halted, piled arms, and settled down on the cold ground,
 54064	but the majority marched all night and arrived at places where they
 54065	evidently should not have been.
 54066	
 54067	Only Count OrlÃ³v-DenÃ­sov with his Cossacks (the least important
 54068	detachment of all) got to his appointed place at the right time. This
 54069	detachment halted at the outskirts of a forest, on the path leading from
 54070	the village of StromÃ­lova to DmÃ­trovsk.
 54071	
 54072	Toward dawn, Count OrlÃ³v-DenÃ­sov, who had dozed off, was awakened by a
 54073	deserter from the French army being brought to him. This was a Polish
 54074	sergeant of Poniatowskiâs corps, who explained in Polish that he had
 54075	come over because he had been slighted in the service: that he ought
 54076	long ago to have been made an officer, that he was braver than any of
 54077	them, and so he had left them and wished to pay them out. He said that
 54078	Murat was spending the night less than a mile from where they were,
 54079	and that if they would let him have a convoy of a hundred men he would
 54080	capture him alive. Count OrlÃ³v-DenÃ­sov consulted his fellow officers.
 54081	
 54082	The offer was too tempting to be refused. Everyone volunteered to go and
 54083	everybody advised making the attempt. After much disputing and arguing,
 54084	Major-General GrÃ©kov with two Cossack regiments decided to go with the
 54085	Polish sergeant.
 54086	
 54087	âNow, remember,â said Count OrlÃ³v-DenÃ­sov to the sergeant at parting,
 54088	âif you have been lying Iâll have you hanged like a dog; but if itâs
 54089	true you shall have a hundred gold pieces!â
 54090	
 54091	Without replying, the sergeant, with a resolute air, mounted and rode
 54092	away with GrÃ©kov whose men had quickly assembled. They disappeared into
 54093	the forest, and Count OrlÃ³v-DenÃ­sov, having seen GrÃ©kov off, returned,
 54094	shivering from the freshness of the early dawn and excited by what he
 54095	had undertaken on his own responsibility, and began looking at the enemy
 54096	camp, now just visible in the deceptive light of dawn and the dying
 54097	campfires. Our columns ought to have begun to appear on an open
 54098	declivity to his right. He looked in that direction, but though the
 54099	columns would have been visible quite far off, they were not to be seen.
 54100	It seemed to the count that things were beginning to stir in the French
 54101	camp, and his keen-sighted adjutant confirmed this.
 54102	
 54103	âOh, it is really too late,â said Count OrlÃ³v, looking at the camp.
 54104	
 54105	As often happens when someone we have trusted is no longer before
 54106	our eyes, it suddenly seemed quite clear and obvious to him that the
 54107	sergeant was an impostor, that he had lied, and that the whole Russian
 54108	attack would be ruined by the absence of those two regiments, which
 54109	he would lead away heaven only knew where. How could one capture a
 54110	commander in chief from among such a mass of troops!
 54111	
 54112	âI am sure that rascal was lying,â said the count.
 54113	
 54114	âThey can still be called back,â said one of his suite, who like Count
 54115	OrlÃ³v felt distrustful of the adventure when he looked at the enemyâs
 54116	camp.
 54117	
 54118	âEh? Really... what do you think? Should we let them go on or not?â
 54119	
 54120	âWill you have them fetched back?â
 54121	
 54122	âFetch them back, fetch them back!â said Count OrlÃ³v with sudden
 54123	determination, looking at his watch. âIt will be too late. It is quite
 54124	light.â
 54125	
 54126	And the adjutant galloped through the forest after GrÃ©kov. When GrÃ©kov
 54127	returned, Count OrlÃ³v-DenÃ­sov, excited both by the abandoned attempt and
 54128	by vainly awaiting the infantry columns that still did not appear, as
 54129	well as by the proximity of the enemy, resolved to advance. All his men
 54130	felt the same excitement.
 54131	
 54132	âMount!â he commanded in a whisper. The men took their places and
 54133	crossed themselves.... âForward, with Godâs aid!â
 54134	
 54135	âHurrah-ah-ah!â reverberated in the forest, and the Cossack companies,
 54136	trailing their lances and advancing one after another as if poured out
 54137	of a sack, dashed gaily across the brook toward the camp.
 54138	
 54139	One desperate, frightened yell from the first French soldier who saw the
 54140	Cossacks, and all who were in the camp, undressed and only just waking
 54141	up, ran off in all directions, abandoning cannons, muskets, and horses.
 54142	
 54143	Had the Cossacks pursued the French, without heeding what was behind and
 54144	around them, they would have captured Murat and everything there.
 54145	That was what the officers desired. But it was impossible to make the
 54146	Cossacks budge when once they had got booty and prisoners. None of them
 54147	listened to orders. Fifteen hundred prisoners and thirty-eight guns were
 54148	taken on the spot, besides standards and (what seemed most important to
 54149	the Cossacks) horses, saddles, horsecloths, and the like. All this had
 54150	to be dealt with, the prisoners and guns secured, the booty dividedânot
 54151	without some shouting and even a little fighting among themselvesâand it
 54152	was on this that the Cossacks all busied themselves.
 54153	
 54154	The French, not being farther pursued, began to recover themselves: they
 54155	formed into detachments and began firing. OrlÃ³v-DenÃ­sov, still waiting
 54156	for the other columns to arrive, advanced no further.
 54157	
 54158	Meantime, according to the dispositions which said that âthe First
 54159	Column will marchâ and so on, the infantry of the belated columns,
 54160	commanded by Bennigsen and directed by Toll, had started in due order
 54161	and, as always happens, had got somewhere, but not to their appointed
 54162	places. As always happens the men, starting cheerfully, began to halt;
 54163	murmurs were heard, there was a sense of confusion, and finally a
 54164	backward movement. Adjutants and generals galloped about, shouted, grew
 54165	angry, quarreled, said they had come quite wrong and were late, gave
 54166	vent to a little abuse, and at last gave it all up and went forward,
 54167	simply to get somewhere. âWe shall get somewhere or other!â And they did
 54168	indeed get somewhere, though not to their right places; a few eventually
 54169	even got to their right place, but too late to be of any use and only
 54170	in time to be fired at. Toll, who in this battle played the part of
 54171	Weyrother at Austerlitz, galloped assiduously from place to place,
 54172	finding everything upside down everywhere. Thus he stumbled on BagovÃºtâs
 54173	corps in a wood when it was already broad daylight, though the corps
 54174	should long before have joined OrlÃ³v-DenÃ­sov. Excited and vexed by the
 54175	failure and supposing that someone must be responsible for it, Toll
 54176	galloped up to the commander of the corps and began upbraiding him
 54177	severely, saying that he ought to be shot. General BagovÃºt, a fighting
 54178	old soldier of placid temperament, being also upset by all the delay,
 54179	confusion, and cross-purposes, fell into a rage to everybodyâs surprise
 54180	and quite contrary to his usual character and said disagreeable things
 54181	to Toll.
 54182	
 54183	âI prefer not to take lessons from anyone, but I can die with my men as
 54184	well as anybody,â he said, and advanced with a single division.
 54185	
 54186	Coming out onto a field under the enemyâs fire, this brave general went
 54187	straight ahead, leading his men under fire, without considering in his
 54188	agitation whether going into action now, with a single division, would
 54189	be of any use or no. Danger, cannon balls, and bullets were just what he
 54190	needed in his angry mood. One of the first bullets killed him, and other
 54191	bullets killed many of his men. And his division remained under fire for
 54192	some time quite uselessly.
 54193

 54197	
 54198	CHAPTER VII
 54199	
 54200	Meanwhile another column was to have attacked the French from the front,
 54201	but KutÃºzov accompanied that column. He well knew that nothing but
 54202	confusion would come of this battle undertaken against his will, and as
 54203	far as was in his power held the troops back. He did not advance.
 54204	
 54205	He rode silently on his small gray horse, indolently answering
 54206	suggestions that they should attack.
 54207	
 54208	âThe word attack is always on your tongue, but you donât see that we are
 54209	unable to execute complicated maneuvers,â said he to MilorÃ¡dovich who
 54210	asked permission to advance.
 54211	
 54212	âWe couldnât take Murat prisoner this morning or get to the place in
 54213	time, and nothing can be done now!â he replied to someone else.
 54214	
 54215	When KutÃºzov was informed that at the French rearâwhere according to the
 54216	reports of the Cossacks there had previously been nobodyâthere were now
 54217	two battalions of Poles, he gave a sidelong glance at ErmÃ³lov who was
 54218	behind him and to whom he had not spoken since the previous day.
 54219	
 54220	âYou see! They are asking to attack and making plans of all kinds,
 54221	but as soon as one gets to business nothing is ready, and the enemy,
 54222	forewarned, takes measures accordingly.â
 54223	
 54224	ErmÃ³lov screwed up his eyes and smiled faintly on hearing these words.
 54225	He understood that for him the storm had blown over, and that KutÃºzov
 54226	would content himself with that hint.
 54227	
 54228	âHeâs having a little fun at my expense,â said ErmÃ³lov softly, nudging
 54229	with his knee RaÃ©vski who was at his side.
 54230	
 54231	Soon after this, ErmÃ³lov moved up to KutÃºzov and respectfully remarked:
 54232	
 54233	âIt is not too late yet, your Highnessâthe enemy has not gone awayâif
 54234	you were to order an attack! If not, the Guards will not so much as see
 54235	a little smoke.â
 54236	
 54237	KutÃºzov did not reply, but when they reported to him that Muratâs troops
 54238	were in retreat he ordered an advance, though at every hundred paces he
 54239	halted for three quarters of an hour.
 54240	
 54241	The whole battle consisted in what OrlÃ³v-DenÃ­sovâs Cossacks had done:
 54242	the rest of the army merely lost some hundreds of men uselessly.
 54243	
 54244	In consequence of this battle KutÃºzov received a diamond decoration,
 54245	and Bennigsen some diamonds and a hundred thousand rubles, others also
 54246	received pleasant recognitions corresponding to their various grades,
 54247	and following the battle fresh changes were made in the staff.
 54248	
 54249	âThatâs how everything is done with us, all topsy-turvy!â said the
 54250	Russian officers and generals after the TarÃºtino battle, letting it be
 54251	understood that some fool there is doing things all wrong but that
 54252	we ourselves should not have done so, just as people speak today. But
 54253	people who talk like that either do not know what they are talking about
 54254	or deliberately deceive themselves. No battleâTarÃºtino, BorodinÃ³, or
 54255	Austerlitzâtakes place as those who planned it anticipated. That is an
 54256	essential condition.
 54257	
 54258	A countless number of free forces (for nowhere is man freer than during
 54259	a battle, where it is a question of life and death) influence the course
 54260	taken by the fight, and that course never can be known in advance and
 54261	never coincides with the direction of any one force.
 54262	
 54263	If many simultaneously and variously directed forces act on a given
 54264	body, the direction of its motion cannot coincide with any one of those
 54265	forces, but will always be a meanâwhat in mechanics is represented by
 54266	the diagonal of a parallelogram of forces.
 54267	
 54268	If in the descriptions given by historians, especially French ones, we
 54269	find their wars and battles carried out in accordance with previously
 54270	formed plans, the only conclusion to be drawn is that those descriptions
 54271	are false.
 54272	
 54273	The battle of TarÃºtino obviously did not attain the aim Toll had in
 54274	viewâto lead the troops into action in the order prescribed by the
 54275	dispositions; nor that which Count OrlÃ³v-DenÃ­sov may have had in viewâto
 54276	take Murat prisoner; nor the result of immediately destroying the whole
 54277	corps, which Bennigsen and others may have had in view; nor the aim of
 54278	the officer who wished to go into action to distinguish himself; nor
 54279	that of the Cossack who wanted more booty than he got, and so on. But
 54280	if the aim of the battle was what actually resulted and what all the
 54281	Russians of that day desiredâto drive the French out of Russia and
 54282	destroy their armyâit is quite clear that the battle of TarÃºtino, just
 54283	because of its incongruities, was exactly what was wanted at that stage
 54284	of the campaign. It would be difficult and even impossible to imagine
 54285	any result more opportune than the actual outcome of this battle. With
 54286	a minimum of effort and insignificant losses, despite the greatest
 54287	confusion, the most important results of the whole campaign were
 54288	attained: the transition from retreat to advance, an exposure of the
 54289	weakness of the French, and the administration of that shock which
 54290	Napoleonâs army had only awaited to begin its flight.
 54291	
 54292	
 54293	
 54294	
 54295	
 54296	CHAPTER VIII
 54297	
 54298	Napoleon enters Moscow after the brilliant victory de la Moskowa; there
 54299	can be no doubt about the victory for the battlefield remains in the
 54300	hands of the French. The Russians retreat and abandon their ancient
 54301	capital. Moscow, abounding in provisions, arms, munitions, and
 54302	incalculable wealth, is in Napoleonâs hands. The Russian army, only half
 54303	the strength of the French, does not make a single attempt to attack for
 54304	a whole month. Napoleonâs position is most brilliant. He can either fall
 54305	on the Russian army with double its strength and destroy it; negotiate
 54306	an advantageous peace, or in case of a refusal make a menacing move on
 54307	Petersburg, or even, in the case of a reverse, return to SmolÃ©nsk or
 54308	VÃ­lna; or remain in Moscow; in short, no special genius would seem to be
 54309	required to retain the brilliant position the French held at that time.
 54310	For that, only very simple and easy steps were necessary: not to allow
 54311	the troops to loot, to prepare winter clothingâof which there was
 54312	sufficient in Moscow for the whole armyâand methodically to collect the
 54313	provisions, of which (according to the French historians) there were
 54314	enough in Moscow to supply the whole army for six months. Yet Napoleon,
 54315	that greatest of all geniuses, who the historians declare had control of
 54316	the army, took none of these steps.
 54317	
 54318	He not merely did nothing of the kind, but on the contrary he used his
 54319	power to select the most foolish and ruinous of all the courses open
 54320	to him. Of all that Napoleon might have done: wintering in Moscow,
 54321	advancing on Petersburg or on NÃ­zhni-NÃ³vgorod, or retiring by a more
 54322	northerly or more southerly route (say by the road KutÃºzov afterwards
 54323	took), nothing more stupid or disastrous can be imagined than what he
 54324	actually did. He remained in Moscow till October, letting the troops
 54325	plunder the city; then, hesitating whether to leave a garrison behind
 54326	him, he quitted Moscow, approached KutÃºzov without joining battle,
 54327	turned to the right and reached MÃ¡lo-YaroslÃ¡vets, again without
 54328	attempting to break through and take the road KutÃºzov took, but retiring
 54329	instead to MozhÃ¡ysk along the devastated SmolÃ©nsk road. Nothing more
 54330	stupid than that could have been devised, or more disastrous for the
 54331	army, as the sequel showed. Had Napoleonâs aim been to destroy his army,
 54332	the most skillful strategist could hardly have devised any series
 54333	of actions that would so completely have accomplished that purpose,
 54334	independently of anything the Russian army might do.
 54335	
 54336	Napoleon, the man of genius, did this! But to say that he destroyed his
 54337	army because he wished to, or because he was very stupid, would be as
 54338	unjust as to say that he had brought his troops to Moscow because he
 54339	wished to and because he was very clever and a genius.
 54340	
 54341	In both cases his personal activity, having no more force than the
 54342	personal activity of any soldier, merely coincided with the laws that
 54343	guided the event.
 54344	
 54345	The historians quite falsely represent Napoleonâs faculties as having
 54346	weakened in Moscow, and do so only because the results did not justify
 54347	his actions. He employed all his ability and strength to do the best he
 54348	could for himself and his army, as he had done previously and as he did
 54349	subsequently in 1813. His activity at that time was no less astounding
 54350	than it was in Egypt, in Italy, in Austria, and in Prussia. We do not
 54351	know for certain in how far his genius was genuine in Egyptâwhere forty
 54352	centuries looked down upon his grandeurâfor his great exploits there are
 54353	all told us by Frenchmen. We cannot accurately estimate his genius in
 54354	Austria or Prussia, for we have to draw our information from French
 54355	or German sources, and the incomprehensible surrender of whole corps
 54356	without fighting and of fortresses without a siege must incline Germans
 54357	to recognize his genius as the only explanation of the war carried on
 54358	in Germany. But we, thank God, have no need to recognize his genius
 54359	in order to hide our shame. We have paid for the right to look at the
 54360	matter plainly and simply, and we will not abandon that right.
 54361	
 54362	His activity in Moscow was as amazing and as full of genius as
 54363	elsewhere. Order after order and plan after plan were issued by him
 54364	from the time he entered Moscow till the time he left it. The absence
 54365	of citizens and of a deputation, and even the burning of Moscow, did not
 54366	disconcert him. He did not lose sight either of the welfare of his
 54367	army or of the doings of the enemy, or of the welfare of the people
 54368	of Russia, or of the direction of affairs in Paris, or of diplomatic
 54369	considerations concerning the terms of the anticipated peace.
 54370	
 54371	
 54372	
 54373	
 54374	
 54375	CHAPTER IX
 54376	
 54377	With regard to military matters, Napoleon immediately on his entry into
 54378	Moscow gave General Sabastiani strict orders to observe the movements
 54379	of the Russian army, sent army corps out along the different roads, and
 54380	charged Murat to find KutÃºzov. Then he gave careful directions about the
 54381	fortification of the KrÃ©mlin, and drew up a brilliant plan for a future
 54382	campaign over the whole map of Russia.
 54383	
 54384	With regard to diplomatic questions, Napoleon summoned Captain YÃ¡kovlev,
 54385	who had been robbed and was in rags and did not know how to get out of
 54386	Moscow, minutely explained to him his whole policy and his magnanimity,
 54387	and having written a letter to the Emperor Alexander in which he
 54388	considered it his duty to inform his Friend and Brother that RostopchÃ­n
 54389	had managed affairs badly in Moscow, he dispatched YÃ¡kovlev to
 54390	Petersburg.
 54391	
 54392	Having similarly explained his views and his magnanimity to TutÃ³lmin, he
 54393	dispatched that old man also to Petersburg to negotiate.
 54394	
 54395	With regard to legal matters, immediately after the fires he gave orders
 54396	to find and execute the incendiaries. And the scoundrel RostopchÃ­n was
 54397	punished by an order to burn down his houses.
 54398	
 54399	With regard to administrative matters, Moscow was granted a
 54400	constitution. A municipality was established and the following
 54401	announcement issued:
 54402	
 54403	
 54404	INHABITANTS OF MOSCOW!
 54405	
 54406	Your misfortunes are cruel, but His Majesty the Emperor and King
 54407	desires to arrest their course. Terrible examples have taught you how he
 54408	punishes disobedience and crime. Strict measures have been taken to
 54409	put an end to disorder and to re-establish public security. A
 54410	paternal administration, chosen from among yourselves, will form your
 54411	municipality or city government. It will take care of you, of your
 54412	needs, and of your welfare. Its members will be distinguished by a red
 54413	ribbon worn across the shoulder, and the mayor of the city will wear
 54414	a white belt as well. But when not on duty they will only wear a red
 54415	ribbon round the left arm.
 54416	
 54417	The city police is established on its former footing, and better order
 54418	already prevails in consequence of its activity. The government has
 54419	appointed two commissaries general, or chiefs of police, and twenty
 54420	commissaries or captains of wards have been appointed to the different
 54421	wards of the city. You will recognize them by the white ribbon they will
 54422	wear on the left arm. Several churches of different denominations are
 54423	open, and divine service is performed in them unhindered. Your fellow
 54424	citizens are returning every day to their homes and orders have been
 54425	given that they should find in them the help and protection due to
 54426	their misfortunes. These are the measures the government has adopted to
 54427	re-establish order and relieve your condition. But to achieve this
 54428	aim it is necessary that you should add your efforts and should, if
 54429	possible, forget the misfortunes you have suffered, should entertain
 54430	the hope of a less cruel fate, should be certain that inevitable and
 54431	ignominious death awaits those who make any attempt on your persons or
 54432	on what remains of your property, and finally that you should not doubt
 54433	that these will be safeguarded, since such is the will of the greatest
 54434	and most just of monarchs. Soldiers and citizens, of whatever nation you
 54435	may be, re-establish public confidence, the source of the welfare of
 54436	a state, live like brothers, render mutual aid and protection one to
 54437	another, unite to defeat the intentions of the evil-minded, obey the
 54438	military and civil authorities, and your tears will soon cease to flow!
 54439	
 54440	
 54441	With regard to supplies for the army, Napoleon decreed that all the
 54442	troops in turn should enter Moscow Ã  la maraude * to obtain provisions
 54443	for themselves, so that the army might have its future provided for.
 54444	
 54445	    * As looters.
 54446	
 54447	With regard to religion, Napoleon ordered the priests to be brought back
 54448	and services to be again performed in the churches.
 54449	
 54450	With regard to commerce and to provisioning the army, the following was
 54451	placarded everywhere:
 54452	
 54453	PROCLAMATION
 54454	
 54455	You, peaceful inhabitants of Moscow, artisans and workmen whom
 54456	misfortune has driven from the city, and you scattered tillers of
 54457	the soil, still kept out in the fields by groundless fear, listen!
 54458	Tranquillity is returning to this capital and order is being restored in
 54459	it. Your fellow countrymen are emerging boldly from their hiding places
 54460	on finding that they are respected. Any violence to them or to their
 54461	property is promptly punished. His Majesty the Emperor and King protects
 54462	them, and considers no one among you his enemy except those who disobey
 54463	his orders. He desires to end your misfortunes and restore you to your
 54464	homes and families. Respond, therefore, to his benevolent intentions
 54465	and come to us without fear. Inhabitants, return with confidence to your
 54466	abodes! You will soon find means of satisfying your needs. Craftsmen
 54467	and industrious artisans, return to your work, your houses, your shops,
 54468	where the protection of guards awaits you! You shall receive proper pay
 54469	for your work. And lastly you too, peasants, come from the forests where
 54470	you are hiding in terror, return to your huts without fear, in full
 54471	assurance that you will find protection! Markets are established in the
 54472	city where peasants can bring their surplus supplies and the products of
 54473	the soil. The government has taken the following steps to ensure freedom
 54474	of sale for them: (1) From today, peasants, husbandmen, and those
 54475	living in the neighborhood of Moscow may without any danger bring their
 54476	supplies of all kinds to two appointed markets, of which one is on
 54477	the MokhovÃ¡ya Street and the other at the Provision Market. (2) Such
 54478	supplies will be bought from them at such prices as seller and buyer may
 54479	agree on, and if a seller is unable to obtain a fair price he will be
 54480	free to take his goods back to his village and no one may hinder him
 54481	under any pretense. (3) Sunday and Wednesday of each week are appointed
 54482	as the chief market days and to that end a sufficient number of troops
 54483	will be stationed along the highroads on Tuesdays and Saturdays at such
 54484	distances from the town as to protect the carts. (4) Similar measures
 54485	will be taken that peasants with their carts and horses may meet with no
 54486	hindrance on their return journey. (5) Steps will immediately be taken
 54487	to re-establish ordinary trading.
 54488	
 54489	Inhabitants of the city and villages, and you, workingmen and artisans,
 54490	to whatever nation you belong, you are called on to carry out the
 54491	paternal intentions of His Majesty the Emperor and King and to
 54492	co-operate with him for the public welfare! Lay your respect and
 54493	confidence at his feet and do not delay to unite with us!
 54494	
 54495	
 54496	With the object of raising the spirits of the troops and of the people,
 54497	reviews were constantly held and rewards distributed. The Emperor
 54498	rode through the streets to comfort the inhabitants, and, despite his
 54499	preoccupation with state affairs, himself visited the theaters that were
 54500	established by his order.
 54501	
 54502	In regard to philanthropy, the greatest virtue of crowned heads,
 54503	Napoleon also did all in his power. He caused the words Maison de ma
 54504	MÃ¨re to be inscribed on the charitable institutions, thereby combining
 54505	tender filial affection with the majestic benevolence of a monarch. He
 54506	visited the Foundling Hospital and, allowing the orphans saved by him
 54507	to kiss his white hands, graciously conversed with TutÃ³lmin. Then, as
 54508	Thiers eloquently recounts, he ordered his soldiers to be paid in forged
 54509	Russian money which he had prepared: âRaising the use of these means
 54510	by an act worthy of himself and of the French army, he let relief
 54511	be distributed to those who had been burned out. But as food was too
 54512	precious to be given to foreigners, who were for the most part enemies,
 54513	Napoleon preferred to supply them with money with which to purchase food
 54514	from outside, and had paper rubles distributed to them.â
 54515	
 54516	With reference to army discipline, orders were continually being issued
 54517	to inflict severe punishment for the nonperformance of military duties
 54518	and to suppress robbery.

 54524	CHAPTER X
 54525	
 54526	But strange to say, all these measures, efforts, and plansâwhich were
 54527	not at all worse than others issued in similar circumstancesâdid not
 54528	affect the essence of the matter but, like the hands of a clock detached
 54529	from the mechanism, swung about in an arbitrary and aimless way without
 54530	engaging the cogwheels.
 54531	
 54532	With reference to the military sideâthe plan of campaignâthat work of
 54533	genius of which Thiers remarks that, âHis genius never devised anything
 54534	more profound, more skillful, or more admirable,â and enters into a
 54535	polemic with M. Fain to prove that this work of genius must be referred
 54536	not to the fourth but to the fifteenth of Octoberâthat plan never was or
 54537	could be executed, for it was quite out of touch with the facts of the
 54538	case. The fortifying of the KrÃ©mlin, for which la MosquÃ©e (as Napoleon
 54539	termed the church of Basil the Beatified) was to have been razed to
 54540	the ground, proved quite useless. The mining of the KrÃ©mlin only helped
 54541	toward fulfilling Napoleonâs wish that it should be blown up when he
 54542	left Moscowâas a child wants the floor on which he has hurt himself to
 54543	be beaten. The pursuit of the Russian army, about which Napoleon was so
 54544	concerned, produced an unheard-of result. The French generals lost touch
 54545	with the Russian army of sixty thousand men, and according to Thiers it
 54546	was only eventually found, like a lost pin, by the skillâand apparently
 54547	the geniusâof Murat.
 54548	
 54549	With reference to diplomacy, all Napoleonâs arguments as to his
 54550	magnanimity and justice, both to TutÃ³lmin and to YÃ¡kovlev (whose chief
 54551	concern was to obtain a greatcoat and a conveyance), proved useless;
 54552	Alexander did not receive these envoys and did not reply to their
 54553	embassage.
 54554	
 54555	With regard to legal matters, after the execution of the supposed
 54556	incendiaries the rest of Moscow burned down.
 54557	
 54558	With regard to administrative matters, the establishment of a
 54559	municipality did not stop the robberies and was only of use to certain
 54560	people who formed part of that municipality and under pretext of
 54561	preserving order looted Moscow or saved their own property from being
 54562	looted.
 54563	
 54564	With regard to religion, as to which in Egypt matters had so easily been
 54565	settled by Napoleonâs visit to a mosque, no results were achieved.
 54566	Two or three priests who were found in Moscow did try to carry out
 54567	Napoleonâs wish, but one of them was slapped in the face by a French
 54568	soldier while conducting service, and a French official reported of
 54569	another that: âThe priest whom I found and invited to say Mass cleaned
 54570	and locked up the church. That night the doors were again broken
 54571	open, the padlocks smashed, the books mutilated, and other disorders
 54572	perpetrated.â
 54573	
 54574	With reference to commerce, the proclamation to industrious workmen and
 54575	to peasants evoked no response. There were no industrious workmen, and
 54576	the peasants caught the commissaries who ventured too far out of town
 54577	with the proclamation and killed them.
 54578	
 54579	As to the theaters for the entertainment of the people and the troops,
 54580	these did not meet with success either. The theaters set up in the
 54581	KrÃ©mlin and in PosnyÃ¡kovâs house were closed again at once because the
 54582	actors and actresses were robbed.
 54583	
 54584	Even philanthropy did not have the desired effect. The genuine as
 54585	well as the false paper money which flooded Moscow lost its value. The
 54586	French, collecting booty, cared only for gold. Not only was the
 54587	paper money valueless which Napoleon so graciously distributed to the
 54588	unfortunate, but even silver lost its value in relation to gold.
 54589	
 54590	But the most amazing example of the ineffectiveness of the orders given
 54591	by the authorities at that time was Napoleonâs attempt to stop the
 54592	looting and re-establish discipline.
 54593	
 54594	This is what the army authorities were reporting:
 54595	
 54596	âLooting continues in the city despite the decrees against it. Order
 54597	is not yet restored and not a single merchant is carrying on trade in a
 54598	lawful manner. The sutlers alone venture to trade, and they sell stolen
 54599	goods.â
 54600	
 54601	âThe neighborhood of my ward continues to be pillaged by soldiers of
 54602	the 3rd Corps who, not satisfied with taking from the unfortunate
 54603	inhabitants hiding in the cellars the little they have left, even have
 54604	the ferocity to wound them with their sabers, as I have repeatedly
 54605	witnessed.â
 54606	
 54607	âNothing new, except that the soldiers are robbing and pillagingâOctober
 54608	9.â
 54609	
 54610	âRobbery and pillaging continue. There is a band of thieves in our
 54611	district who ought to be arrested by a strong forceâOctober 11.â
 54612	
 54613	âThe Emperor is extremely displeased that despite the strict orders to
 54614	stop pillage, parties of marauding Guards are continually seen returning
 54615	to the KrÃ©mlin. Among the Old Guard disorder and pillage were renewed
 54616	more violently than ever yesterday evening, last night, and today. The
 54617	Emperor sees with regret that the picked soldiers appointed to guard his
 54618	person, who should set an example of discipline, carry disobedience to
 54619	such a point that they break into the cellars and stores containing army
 54620	supplies. Others have disgraced themselves to the extent of disobeying
 54621	sentinels and officers, and have abused and beaten them.â
 54622	
 54623	âThe Grand Marshal of the palace,â wrote the governor, âcomplains
 54624	bitterly that in spite of repeated orders, the soldiers continue to
 54625	commit nuisances in all the courtyards and even under the very windows
 54626	of the Emperor.â
 54627	
 54628	That army, like a herd of cattle run wild and trampling underfoot the
 54629	provender which might have saved it from starvation, disintegrated and
 54630	perished with each additional day it remained in Moscow. But it did not
 54631	go away.
 54632	
 54633	It began to run away only when suddenly seized by a panic caused by the
 54634	capture of transport trains on the SmolÃ©nsk road, and by the battle of
 54635	TarÃºtino. The news of that battle of TarÃºtino, unexpectedly received
 54636	by Napoleon at a review, evoked in him a desire to punish the Russians
 54637	(Thiers says), and he issued the order for departure which the whole
 54638	army was demanding.
 54639	
 54640	Fleeing from Moscow the soldiers took with them everything they had
 54641	stolen. Napoleon, too, carried away his own personal trÃ©sor, but on
 54642	seeing the baggage trains that impeded the army, he was (Thiers says)
 54643	horror-struck. And yet with his experience of war he did not order all
 54644	the superfluous vehicles to be burned, as he had done with those of a
 54645	certain marshal when approaching Moscow. He gazed at the calÃ¨ches and
 54646	carriages in which soldiers were riding and remarked that it was a very
 54647	good thing, as those vehicles could be used to carry provisions, the
 54648	sick, and the wounded.
 54649	
 54650	The plight of the whole army resembled that of a wounded animal which
 54651	feels it is perishing and does not know what it is doing. To study the
 54652	skillful tactics and aims of Napoleon and his army from the time it
 54653	entered Moscow till it was destroyed is like studying the dying leaps
 54654	and shudders of a mortally wounded animal. Very often a wounded animal,
 54655	hearing a rustle, rushes straight at the hunterâs gun, runs forward and
 54656	back again, and hastens its own end. Napoleon, under pressure from his
 54657	whole army, did the same thing. The rustle of the battle of TarÃºtino
 54658	frightened the beast, and it rushed forward onto the hunterâs gun,
 54659	reached him, turned back, and finallyâlike any wild beastâran back along
 54660	the most disadvantageous and dangerous path, where the old scent was
 54661	familiar.
 54662	
 54663	During the whole of that period Napoleon, who seems to us to have been
 54664	the leader of all these movementsâas the figurehead of a ship may seem
 54665	to a savage to guide the vesselâacted like a child who, holding a couple
 54666	of strings inside a carriage, thinks he is driving it.

 54672	CHAPTER XI
 54673	
 54674	Early in the morning of the sixth of October Pierre went out of the
 54675	shed, and on returning stopped by the door to play with a little
 54676	blue-gray dog, with a long body and short bandy legs, that jumped about
 54677	him. This little dog lived in their shed, sleeping beside KaratÃ¡ev at
 54678	night; it sometimes made excursions into the town but always returned
 54679	again. Probably it had never had an owner, and it still belonged to
 54680	nobody and had no name. The French called it Azor; the soldier who
 54681	told stories called it FemgÃ¡lka; KaratÃ¡ev and others called it Gray, or
 54682	sometimes Flabby. Its lack of a master, a name, or even of a breed or
 54683	any definite color did not seem to trouble the blue-gray dog in the
 54684	least. Its furry tail stood up firm and round as a plume, its bandy legs
 54685	served it so well that it would often gracefully lift a hind leg and run
 54686	very easily and quickly on three legs, as if disdaining to use all
 54687	four. Everything pleased it. Now it would roll on its back, yelping with
 54688	delight, now bask in the sun with a thoughtful air of importance, and
 54689	now frolic about playing with a chip of wood or a straw.
 54690	
 54691	Pierreâs attire by now consisted of a dirty torn shirt (the only
 54692	remnant of his former clothing), a pair of soldierâs trousers which by
 54693	KaratÃ¡evâs advice he tied with string round the ankles for warmth, and
 54694	a peasant coat and cap. Physically he had changed much during this
 54695	time. He no longer seemed stout, though he still had the appearance of
 54696	solidity and strength hereditary in his family. A beard and mustache
 54697	covered the lower part of his face, and a tangle of hair, infested
 54698	with lice, curled round his head like a cap. The look of his eyes
 54699	was resolute, calm, and animatedly alert, as never before. The former
 54700	slackness which had shown itself even in his eyes was now replaced by an
 54701	energetic readiness for action and resistance. His feet were bare.
 54702	
 54703	Pierre first looked down the field across which vehicles and horsemen
 54704	were passing that morning, then into the distance across the river, then
 54705	at the dog who was pretending to be in earnest about biting him,
 54706	and then at his bare feet which he placed with pleasure in various
 54707	positions, moving his dirty thick big toes. Every time he looked at his
 54708	bare feet a smile of animated self-satisfaction flitted across his face.
 54709	The sight of them reminded him of all he had experienced and learned
 54710	during these weeks and this recollection was pleasant to him.
 54711	
 54712	For some days the weather had been calm and clear with slight frosts in
 54713	the morningsâwhat is called an âold wivesâ summer.â
 54714	
 54715	In the sunshine the air was warm, and that warmth was particularly
 54716	pleasant with the invigorating freshness of the morning frost still in
 54717	the air.
 54718	
 54719	On everythingâfar and nearâlay the magic crystal glitter seen only at
 54720	that time of autumn. The Sparrow Hills were visible in the distance,
 54721	with the village, the church, and the large white house. The bare trees,
 54722	the sand, the bricks and roofs of the houses, the green church spire,
 54723	and the corners of the white house in the distance, all stood out in the
 54724	transparent air in most delicate outline and with unnatural clearness.
 54725	Near by could be seen the familiar ruins of a half-burned mansion
 54726	occupied by the French, with lilac bushes still showing dark green
 54727	beside the fence. And even that ruined and befouled houseâwhich in dull
 54728	weather was repulsively uglyâseemed quietly beautiful now, in the clear,
 54729	motionless brilliance.
 54730	
 54731	A French corporal, with coat unbuttoned in a homely way, a skullcap on
 54732	his head, and a short pipe in his mouth, came from behind a corner of
 54733	the shed and approached Pierre with a friendly wink.
 54734	
 54735	âWhat sunshine, Monsieur Kiril!â (Their name for Pierre.) âEh? Just like
 54736	spring!â
 54737	
 54738	And the corporal leaned against the door and offered Pierre his pipe,
 54739	though whenever he offered it Pierre always declined it.
 54740	
 54741	âTo be on the march in such weather...â he began.
 54742	
 54743	Pierre inquired what was being said about leaving, and the corporal told
 54744	him that nearly all the troops were starting and there ought to be an
 54745	order about the prisoners that day. SokolÃ³v, one of the soldiers in the
 54746	shed with Pierre, was dying, and Pierre told the corporal that something
 54747	should be done about him. The corporal replied that Pierre need not
 54748	worry about that as they had an ambulance and a permanent hospital and
 54749	arrangements would be made for the sick, and that in general everything
 54750	that could happen had been foreseen by the authorities.
 54751	
 54752	âBesides, Monsieur Kiril, you have only to say a word to the captain,
 54753	you know. He is a man who never forgets anything. Speak to the captain
 54754	when he makes his round, he will do anything for you.â
 54755	
 54756	(The captain of whom the corporal spoke often had long chats with Pierre
 54757	and showed him all sorts of favors.)
 54758	
 54759	ââYou see, St. Thomas,â he said to me the other day. âMonsieur Kiril is
 54760	a man of education, who speaks French. He is a Russian seigneur who has
 54761	had misfortunes, but he is a man. He knows whatâs what.... If he wants
 54762	anything and asks me, he wonât get a refusal. When one has studied, you
 54763	see, one likes education and well-bred people.â It is for your sake I
 54764	mention it, Monsieur Kiril. The other day if it had not been for you
 54765	that affair would have ended ill.â
 54766	
 54767	And after chatting a while longer, the corporal went away. (The affair
 54768	he had alluded to had happened a few days beforeâa fight between the
 54769	prisoners and the French soldiers, in which Pierre had succeeded in
 54770	pacifying his comrades.) Some of the prisoners who had heard Pierre
 54771	talking to the corporal immediately asked what the Frenchman had said.
 54772	While Pierre was repeating what he had been told about the army leaving
 54773	Moscow, a thin, sallow, tattered French soldier came up to the door of
 54774	the shed. Rapidly and timidly raising his fingers to his forehead by way
 54775	of greeting, he asked Pierre whether the soldier Platoche to whom he had
 54776	given a shirt to sew was in that shed.
 54777	
 54778	A week before the French had had boot leather and linen issued to them,
 54779	which they had given out to the prisoners to make up into boots and
 54780	shirts for them.
 54781	
 54782	âReady, ready, dear fellow!â said KaratÃ¡ev, coming out with a neatly
 54783	folded shirt.
 54784	
 54785	KaratÃ¡ev, on account of the warm weather and for convenience at work,
 54786	was wearing only trousers and a tattered shirt as black as soot. His
 54787	hair was bound round, workman fashion, with a wisp of lime-tree bast,
 54788	and his round face seemed rounder and pleasanter than ever.
 54789	
 54790	âA promise is own brother to performance! I said Friday and here it is,
 54791	ready,â said PlatÃ³n, smiling and unfolding the shirt he had sewn.
 54792	
 54793	The Frenchman glanced around uneasily and then, as if overcoming his
 54794	hesitation, rapidly threw off his uniform and put on the shirt. He had
 54795	a long, greasy, flowered silk waistcoat next to his sallow, thin bare
 54796	body, but no shirt. He was evidently afraid the prisoners looking on
 54797	would laugh at him, and thrust his head into the shirt hurriedly. None
 54798	of the prisoners said a word.
 54799	
 54800	âSee, it fits well!â PlatÃ³n kept repeating, pulling the shirt straight.
 54801	
 54802	The Frenchman, having pushed his head and hands through, without raising
 54803	his eyes, looked down at the shirt and examined the seams.
 54804	
 54805	âYou see, dear man, this is not a sewing shop, and I had no proper
 54806	tools; and, as they say, one needs a tool even to kill a louse,â said
 54807	PlatÃ³n with one of his round smiles, obviously pleased with his work.
 54808	
 54809	âItâs good, quite good, thank you,â said the Frenchman, in French, âbut
 54810	there must be some linen left over.â
 54811	
 54812	âIt will fit better still when it sets to your body,â said KaratÃ¡ev,
 54813	still admiring his handiwork. âYouâll be nice and comfortable....â
 54814	
 54815	âThanks, thanks, old fellow.... But the bits left over?â said the
 54816	Frenchman again and smiled. He took out an assignation ruble note and
 54817	gave it to KaratÃ¡ev. âBut give me the pieces that are over.â
 54818	
 54819	Pierre saw that PlatÃ³n did not want to understand what the Frenchman
 54820	was saying, and he looked on without interfering. KaratÃ¡ev thanked the
 54821	Frenchman for the money and went on admiring his own work. The Frenchman
 54822	insisted on having the pieces returned that were left over and asked
 54823	Pierre to translate what he said.
 54824	
 54825	âWhat does he want the bits for?â said KaratÃ¡ev. âTheyâd make fine leg
 54826	bands for us. Well, never mind.â
 54827	
 54828	And KaratÃ¡ev, with a suddenly changed and saddened expression, took
 54829	a small bundle of scraps from inside his shirt and gave it to the
 54830	Frenchman without looking at him. âOh dear!â muttered KaratÃ¡ev and went
 54831	away. The Frenchman looked at the linen, considered for a moment, then
 54832	looked inquiringly at Pierre and, as if Pierreâs look had told him
 54833	something, suddenly blushed and shouted in a squeaky voice:
 54834	
 54835	âPlatoche! Eh, Platoche! Keep them yourself!â And handing back the odd
 54836	bits he turned and went out.
 54837	
 54838	âThere, look at that,â said KaratÃ¡ev, swaying his head. âPeople said
 54839	they were not Christians, but they too have souls. Itâs what the old
 54840	folk used to say: âA sweating handâs an open hand, a dry handâs close.â
 54841	Heâs naked, but yet heâs given it back.â
 54842	
 54843	KaratÃ¡ev smiled thoughtfully and was silent awhile looking at the
 54844	pieces.
 54845	
 54846	âBut theyâll make grand leg bands, dear friend,â he said, and went back
 54847	into the shed.
 54848	
 54849	
 54850	
 54851	
 54852	
 54853	CHAPTER XII
 54854	
 54855	Four weeks had passed since Pierre had been taken prisoner and though
 54856	the French had offered to move him from the menâs to the officersâ shed,
 54857	he had stayed in the shed where he was first put.
 54858	
 54859	In burned and devastated Moscow Pierre experienced almost the extreme
 54860	limits of privation a man can endure; but thanks to his physical
 54861	strength and health, of which he had till then been unconscious, and
 54862	thanks especially to the fact that the privations came so gradually that
 54863	it was impossible to say when they began, he endured his position
 54864	not only lightly but joyfully. And just at this time he obtained the
 54865	tranquillity and ease of mind he had formerly striven in vain to reach.
 54866	He had long sought in different ways that tranquillity of mind, that
 54867	inner harmony which had so impressed him in the soldiers at the battle
 54868	of BorodinÃ³. He had sought it in philanthropy, in Freemasonry, in the
 54869	dissipations of town life, in wine, in heroic feats of self-sacrifice,
 54870	and in romantic love for NatÃ¡sha; he had sought it by reasoningâand all
 54871	these quests and experiments had failed him. And now without thinking
 54872	about it he had found that peace and inner harmony only through the
 54873	horror of death, through privation, and through what he recognized in
 54874	KaratÃ¡ev.
 54875	
 54876	Those dreadful moments he had lived through at the executions had as it
 54877	were forever washed away from his imagination and memory the agitating
 54878	thoughts and feelings that had formerly seemed so important. It did
 54879	not now occur to him to think of Russia, or the war, or politics, or
 54880	Napoleon. It was plain to him that all these things were no business
 54881	of his, and that he was not called on to judge concerning them and
 54882	therefore could not do so. âRussia and summer weather are not bound
 54883	together,â he thought, repeating words of KaratÃ¡evâs which he found
 54884	strangely consoling. His intention of killing Napoleon and his
 54885	calculations of the cabalistic number of the beast of the Apocalypse now
 54886	seemed to him meaningless and even ridiculous. His anger with his wife
 54887	and anxiety that his name should not be smirched now seemed not merely
 54888	trivial but even amusing. What concern was it of his that somewhere or
 54889	other that woman was leading the life she preferred? What did it matter
 54890	to anybody, and especially to him, whether or not they found out that
 54891	their prisonerâs name was Count BezÃºkhov?
 54892	
 54893	He now often remembered his conversation with Prince Andrew and quite
 54894	agreed with him, though he understood Prince Andrewâs thoughts somewhat
 54895	differently. Prince Andrew had thought and said that happiness could
 54896	only be negative, but had said it with a shade of bitterness and irony
 54897	as though he was really saying that all desire for positive happiness is
 54898	implanted in us merely to torment us and never be satisfied. But Pierre
 54899	believed it without any mental reservation. The absence of suffering,
 54900	the satisfaction of oneâs needs and consequent freedom in the choice of
 54901	oneâs occupation, that is, of oneâs way of life, now seemed to Pierre to
 54902	be indubitably manâs highest happiness. Here and now for the first time
 54903	he fully appreciated the enjoyment of eating when he wanted to eat,
 54904	drinking when he wanted to drink, sleeping when he wanted to sleep, of
 54905	warmth when he was cold, of talking to a fellow man when he wished to
 54906	talk and to hear a human voice. The satisfaction of oneâs needsâgood
 54907	food, cleanliness, and freedomânow that he was deprived of all this,
 54908	seemed to Pierre to constitute perfect happiness; and the choice
 54909	of occupation, that is, of his way of lifeânow that that was so
 54910	restrictedâseemed to him such an easy matter that he forgot that a
 54911	superfluity of the comforts of life destroys all joy in satisfying oneâs
 54912	needs, while great freedom in the choice of occupationâsuch freedom as
 54913	his wealth, his education, and his social position had given him in his
 54914	own lifeâis just what makes the choice of occupation insolubly difficult
 54915	and destroys the desire and possibility of having an occupation.
 54916	
 54917	All Pierreâs daydreams now turned on the time when he would be free. Yet
 54918	subsequently, and for the rest of his life, he thought and spoke with
 54919	enthusiasm of that month of captivity, of those irrecoverable, strong,
 54920	joyful sensations, and chiefly of the complete peace of mind and inner
 54921	freedom which he experienced only during those weeks.
 54922	
 54923	When on the first day he got up early, went out of the shed at dawn, and
 54924	saw the cupolas and crosses of the New Convent of the Virgin still dark
 54925	at first, the hoarfrost on the dusty grass, the Sparrow Hills, and the
 54926	wooded banks above the winding river vanishing in the purple distance,
 54927	when he felt the contact of the fresh air and heard the noise of the
 54928	crows flying from Moscow across the field, and when afterwards light
 54929	gleamed from the east and the sunâs rim appeared solemnly from behind a
 54930	cloud, and the cupolas and crosses, the hoarfrost, the distance and the
 54931	river, all began to sparkle in the glad lightâPierre felt a new joy and
 54932	strength in life such as he had never before known. And this not only
 54933	stayed with him during the whole of his imprisonment, but even grew in
 54934	strength as the hardships of his position increased.
 54935	
 54936	That feeling of alertness and of readiness for anything was still
 54937	further strengthened in him by the high opinion his fellow prisoners
 54938	formed of him soon after his arrival at the shed. With his knowledge
 54939	of languages, the respect shown him by the French, his simplicity, his
 54940	readiness to give anything asked of him (he received the allowance
 54941	of three rubles a week made to officers); with his strength, which he
 54942	showed to the soldiers by pressing nails into the walls of the hut; his
 54943	gentleness to his companions, and his capacity for sitting still and
 54944	thinking without doing anything (which seemed to them incomprehensible),
 54945	he appeared to them a rather mysterious and superior being. The very
 54946	qualities that had been a hindrance, if not actually harmful, to him in
 54947	the world he had lived inâhis strength, his disdain for the comforts of
 54948	life, his absent-mindedness and simplicityâhere among these people gave
 54949	him almost the status of a hero. And Pierre felt that their opinion
 54950	placed responsibilities upon him.
 54951	
 54952	
 54953	
 54954	
 54955	
 54956	CHAPTER XIII
 54957	
 54958	The French evacuation began on the night between the sixth and seventh
 54959	of October: kitchens and sheds were dismantled, carts loaded, and troops
 54960	and baggage trains started.
 54961	
 54962	At seven in the morning a French convoy in marching trim, wearing shakos
 54963	and carrying muskets, knapsacks, and enormous sacks, stood in front
 54964	of the sheds, and animated French talk mingled with curses sounded all
 54965	along the lines.
 54966	
 54967	In the shed everyone was ready, dressed, belted, shod, and only awaited
 54968	the order to start. The sick soldier, SokolÃ³v, pale and thin with dark
 54969	shadows round his eyes, alone sat in his place barefoot and not dressed.
 54970	His eyes, prominent from the emaciation of his face, gazed inquiringly
 54971	at his comrades who were paying no attention to him, and he moaned
 54972	regularly and quietly. It was evidently not so much his sufferings that
 54973	caused him to moan (he had dysentery) as his fear and grief at being
 54974	left alone.
 54975	
 54976	Pierre, girt with a rope round his waist and wearing shoes KaratÃ¡ev had
 54977	made for him from some leather a French soldier had torn off a tea chest
 54978	and brought to have his boots mended with, went up to the sick man and
 54979	squatted down beside him.
 54980	
 54981	âYou know, SokolÃ³v, they are not all going away! They have a hospital
 54982	here. You may be better off than we others,â said Pierre.
 54983	
 54984	âO Lord! Oh, it will be the death of me! O Lord!â moaned the man in a
 54985	louder voice.
 54986	
 54987	âIâll go and ask them again directly,â said Pierre, rising and going to
 54988	the door of the shed.
 54989	
 54990	Just as Pierre reached the door, the corporal who had offered him a
 54991	pipe the day before came up to it with two soldiers. The corporal and
 54992	soldiers were in marching kit with knapsacks and shakos that had metal
 54993	straps, and these changed their familiar faces.
 54994	
 54995	The corporal came, according to orders, to shut the door. The prisoners
 54996	had to be counted before being let out.
 54997	
 54998	âCorporal, what will they do with the sick man?...â Pierre began.
 54999	
 55000	But even as he spoke he began to doubt whether this was the corporal
 55001	he knew or a stranger, so unlike himself did the corporal seem at that
 55002	moment. Moreover, just as Pierre was speaking a sharp rattle of drums
 55003	was suddenly heard from both sides. The corporal frowned at Pierreâs
 55004	words and, uttering some meaningless oaths, slammed the door. The shed
 55005	became semidark, and the sharp rattle of the drums on two sides drowned
 55006	the sick manâs groans.
 55007	
 55008	âThere it is!... It again!...â said Pierre to himself, and an
 55009	involuntary shudder ran down his spine. In the corporalâs changed face,
 55010	in the sound of his voice, in the stirring and deafening noise of the
 55011	drums, he recognized that mysterious, callous force which compelled
 55012	people against their will to kill their fellow menâthat force the effect
 55013	of which he had witnessed during the executions. To fear or to try to
 55014	escape that force, to address entreaties or exhortations to those who
 55015	served as its tools, was useless. Pierre knew this now. One had to wait
 55016	and endure. He did not again go to the sick man, nor turn to look at
 55017	him, but stood frowning by the door of the hut.
 55018	
 55019	When that door was opened and the prisoners, crowding against one
 55020	another like a flock of sheep, squeezed into the exit, Pierre pushed
 55021	his way forward and approached that very captain who as the corporal had
 55022	assured him was ready to do anything for him. The captain was also in
 55023	marching kit, and on his cold face appeared that same it which Pierre
 55024	had recognized in the corporalâs words and in the roll of the drums.
 55025	
 55026	âPass on, pass on!â the captain reiterated, frowning sternly, and
 55027	looking at the prisoners who thronged past him.
 55028	
 55029	Pierre went up to him, though he knew his attempt would be vain.
 55030	
 55031	âWhat now?â the officer asked with a cold look as if not recognizing
 55032	Pierre.
 55033	
 55034	Pierre told him about the sick man.
 55035	
 55036	âHeâll manage to walk, devil take him!â said the captain. âPass on, pass
 55037	on!â he continued without looking at Pierre.
 55038	
 55039	âBut he is dying,â Pierre again began.
 55040	
 55041	âBe so good...â shouted the captain, frowning angrily.
 55042	
 55043	âDram-da-da-dam, dam-dam...â rattled the drums, and Pierre understood
 55044	that this mysterious force completely controlled these men and that it
 55045	was now useless to say any more.
 55046	
 55047	The officer prisoners were separated from the soldiers and told to march
 55048	in front. There were about thirty officers, with Pierre among them, and
 55049	about three hundred men.
 55050	
 55051	The officers, who had come from the other sheds, were all strangers to
 55052	Pierre and much better dressed than he. They looked at him and at his
 55053	shoes mistrustfully, as at an alien. Not far from him walked a fat major
 55054	with a sallow, bloated, angry face, who was wearing a KazÃ¡n dressing
 55055	gown tied round with a towel, and who evidently enjoyed the respect of
 55056	his fellow prisoners. He kept one hand, in which he clasped his tobacco
 55057	pouch, inside the bosom of his dressing gown and held the stem of his
 55058	pipe firmly with the other. Panting and puffing, the major grumbled and
 55059	growled at everybody because he thought he was being pushed and that
 55060	they were all hurrying when they had nowhere to hurry to and were
 55061	all surprised at something when there was nothing to be surprised at.
 55062	Another, a thin little officer, was speaking to everyone, conjecturing
 55063	where they were now being taken and how far they would get that day. An
 55064	official in felt boots and wearing a commissariat uniform ran round from
 55065	side to side and gazed at the ruins of Moscow, loudly announcing his
 55066	observations as to what had been burned down and what this or that part
 55067	of the city was that they could see. A third officer, who by his accent
 55068	was a Pole, disputed with the commissariat officer, arguing that he was
 55069	mistaken in his identification of the different wards of Moscow.
 55070	
 55071	âWhat are you disputing about?â said the major angrily. âWhat does it
 55072	matter whether it is St. Nicholas or St. Blasius? You see itâs burned
 55073	down, and thereâs an end of it.... What are you pushing for? Isnât the
 55074	road wide enough?â said he, turning to a man behind him who was not
 55075	pushing him at all.
 55076	
 55077	âOh, oh, oh! What have they done?â the prisoners on one side and another
 55078	were heard saying as they gazed on the charred ruins. âAll beyond the
 55079	river, and ZÃºbova, and in the KrÃ©mlin.... Just look! Thereâs not half of
 55080	it left. Yes, I told youâthe whole quarter beyond the river, and so it
 55081	is.â
 55082	
 55083	âWell, you know itâs burned, so whatâs the use of talking?â said the
 55084	major.
 55085	
 55086	As they passed near a church in the KhamÃ³vniki (one of the few unburned
 55087	quarters of Moscow) the whole mass of prisoners suddenly started to one
 55088	side and exclamations of horror and disgust were heard.
 55089	
 55090	âAh, the villains! What heathens! Yes; dead, dead, so he is... And
 55091	smeared with something!â
 55092	
 55093	Pierre too drew near the church where the thing was that evoked these
 55094	exclamations, and dimly made out something leaning against the palings
 55095	surrounding the church. From the words of his comrades who saw better
 55096	than he did, he found that this was the body of a man, set upright
 55097	against the palings with its face smeared with soot.
 55098	
 55099	âGo on! What the devil... Go on! Thirty thousand devils!...â the convoy
 55100	guards began cursing and the French soldiers, with fresh virulence,
 55101	drove away with their swords the crowd of prisoners who were gazing at
 55102	the dead man.
 55103	
 55104	
 55105	
 55106	
 55107	
 55108	CHAPTER XIV
 55109	
 55110	Through the cross streets of the KhamÃ³vniki quarter the prisoners
 55111	marched, followed only by their escort and the vehicles and wagons
 55112	belonging to that escort, but when they reached the supply stores they
 55113	came among a huge and closely packed train of artillery mingled with
 55114	private vehicles.
 55115	
 55116	At the bridge they all halted, waiting for those in front to get across.
 55117	From the bridge they had a view of endless lines of moving baggage
 55118	trains before and behind them. To the right, where the KalÃºga road turns
 55119	near NeskÃºchny, endless rows of troops and carts stretched away into
 55120	the distance. These were troops of Beauharnaisâ corps which had started
 55121	before any of the others. Behind, along the riverside and across the
 55122	Stone Bridge, were Neyâs troops and transport.
 55123	
 55124	Davoutâs troops, in whose charge were the prisoners, were crossing the
 55125	Crimean bridge and some were already debouching into the KalÃºga road.
 55126	But the baggage trains stretched out so that the last of Beauharnaisâ
 55127	train had not yet got out of Moscow and reached the KalÃºga road when
 55128	the vanguard of Neyâs army was already emerging from the Great OrdÃ½nka
 55129	Street.
 55130	
 55131	When they had crossed the Crimean bridge the prisoners moved a few steps
 55132	forward, halted, and again moved on, and from all sides vehicles and men
 55133	crowded closer and closer together. They advanced the few hundred paces
 55134	that separated the bridge from the KalÃºga road, taking more than an
 55135	hour to do so, and came out upon the square where the streets of the
 55136	TransmoskvÃ¡ ward and the KalÃºga road converge, and the prisoners jammed
 55137	close together had to stand for some hours at that crossway. From all
 55138	sides, like the roar of the sea, were heard the rattle of wheels, the
 55139	tramp of feet, and incessant shouts of anger and abuse. Pierre stood
 55140	pressed against the wall of a charred house, listening to that noise
 55141	which mingled in his imagination with the roll of the drums.
 55142	
 55143	To get a better view, several officer prisoners climbed onto the wall of
 55144	the half-burned house against which Pierre was leaning.
 55145	
 55146	âWhat crowds! Just look at the crowds!... Theyâve loaded goods even on
 55147	the cannon! Look there, those are furs!â they exclaimed. âJust see what
 55148	the blackguards have looted.... There! See what that one has behind
 55149	in the cart.... Why, those are settings taken from some icons, by
 55150	heaven!... Oh, the rascals!... See how that fellow has loaded
 55151	himself up, he can hardly walk! Good lord, theyâve even grabbed those
 55152	chaises!... See that fellow there sitting on the trunks.... Heavens!
 55153	Theyâre fighting.â
 55154	
 55155	âThatâs right, hit him on the snoutâon his snout! Like this, we
 55156	shanât get away before evening. Look, look there.... Why, that must be
 55157	Napoleonâs own. See what horses! And the monograms with a crown! Itâs
 55158	like a portable house.... That fellowâs dropped his sack and doesnât see
 55159	it. Fighting again... A woman with a baby, and not bad-looking either!
 55160	Yes, I dare say, thatâs the way theyâll let you pass.... Just look,
 55161	thereâs no end to it. Russian wenches, by heaven, so they are! In
 55162	carriagesâsee how comfortably theyâve settled themselves!â
 55163	
 55164	Again, as at the church in KhamÃ³vniki, a wave of general curiosity
 55165	bore all the prisoners forward onto the road, and Pierre, thanks to
 55166	his stature, saw over the heads of the others what so attracted their
 55167	curiosity. In three carriages involved among the munition carts, closely
 55168	squeezed together, sat women with rouged faces, dressed in glaring
 55169	colors, who were shouting something in shrill voices.
 55170	
 55171	From the moment Pierre had recognized the appearance of the mysterious
 55172	force nothing had seemed to him strange or dreadful: neither the corpse
 55173	smeared with soot for fun nor these women hurrying away nor the burned
 55174	ruins of Moscow. All that he now witnessed scarcely made an impression
 55175	on himâas if his soul, making ready for a hard struggle, refused to
 55176	receive impressions that might weaken it.
 55177	
 55178	The womenâs vehicles drove by. Behind them came more carts, soldiers,
 55179	wagons, soldiers, gun carriages, carriages, soldiers, ammunition carts,
 55180	more soldiers, and now and then women.
 55181	
 55182	Pierre did not see the people as individuals but saw their movement.
 55183	
 55184	All these people and horses seemed driven forward by some invisible
 55185	power. During the hour Pierre watched them they all came flowing from
 55186	the different streets with one and the same desire to get on quickly;
 55187	they all jostled one another, began to grow angry and to fight, white
 55188	teeth gleamed, brows frowned, ever the same words of abuse flew from
 55189	side to side, and all the faces bore the same swaggeringly resolute
 55190	and coldly cruel expression that had struck Pierre that morning on the
 55191	corporalâs face when the drums were beating.
 55192	
 55193	It was not till nearly evening that the officer commanding the escort
 55194	collected his men and with shouts and quarrels forced his way in among
 55195	the baggage trains, and the prisoners, hemmed in on all sides, emerged
 55196	onto the KalÃºga road.
 55197	
 55198	They marched very quickly, without resting, and halted only when the sun
 55199	began to set. The baggage carts drew up close together and the men
 55200	began to prepare for their nightâs rest. They all appeared angry and
 55201	dissatisfied. For a long time, oaths, angry shouts, and fighting could
 55202	be heard from all sides. A carriage that followed the escort ran
 55203	into one of the carts and knocked a hole in it with its pole. Several
 55204	soldiers ran toward the cart from different sides: some beat the
 55205	carriage horses on their heads, turning them aside, others fought among
 55206	themselves, and Pierre saw that one German was badly wounded on the head
 55207	by a sword.
 55208	
 55209	It seemed that all these men, now that they had stopped amid fields
 55210	in the chill dusk of the autumn evening, experienced one and the same
 55211	feeling of unpleasant awakening from the hurry and eagerness to push on
 55212	that had seized them at the start. Once at a standstill they all seemed
 55213	to understand that they did not yet know where they were going, and that
 55214	much that was painful and difficult awaited them on this journey.
 55215	
 55216	During this halt the escort treated the prisoners even worse than they
 55217	had done at the start. It was here that the prisoners for the first time
 55218	received horseflesh for their meat ration.
 55219	
 55220	From the officer down to the lowest soldier they showed what seemed like
 55221	personal spite against each of the prisoners, in unexpected contrast to
 55222	their former friendly relations.
 55223	
 55224	This spite increased still more when, on calling over the roll of
 55225	prisoners, it was found that in the bustle of leaving Moscow one Russian
 55226	soldier, who had pretended to suffer from colic, had escaped. Pierre saw
 55227	a Frenchman beat a Russian soldier cruelly for straying too far from
 55228	the road, and heard his friend the captain reprimand and threaten to
 55229	court-martial a noncommissioned officer on account of the escape of the
 55230	Russian. To the noncommissioned officerâs excuse that the prisoner was
 55231	ill and could not walk, the officer replied that the order was to shoot
 55232	those who lagged behind. Pierre felt that that fatal force which had
 55233	crushed him during the executions, but which he had not felt during his
 55234	imprisonment, now again controlled his existence. It was terrible, but
 55235	he felt that in proportion to the efforts of that fatal force to crush
 55236	him, there grew and strengthened in his soul a power of life independent
 55237	of it.
 55238	
 55239	He ate his supper of buckwheat soup with horseflesh and chatted with his
 55240	comrades.
 55241	
 55242	Neither Pierre nor any of the others spoke of what they had seen in
 55243	Moscow, or of the roughness of their treatment by the French, or of the
 55244	order to shoot them which had been announced to them. As if in reaction
 55245	against the worsening of their position they were all particularly
 55246	animated and gay. They spoke of personal reminiscences, of amusing
 55247	scenes they had witnessed during the campaign, and avoided all talk of
 55248	their present situation.
 55249	
 55250	The sun had set long since. Bright stars shone out here and there in the
 55251	sky. A red glow as of a conflagration spread above the horizon from the
 55252	rising full moon, and that vast red ball swayed strangely in the gray
 55253	haze. It grew light. The evening was ending, but the night had not yet
 55254	come. Pierre got up and left his new companions, crossing between the
 55255	campfires to the other side of the road where he had been told the
 55256	common soldier prisoners were stationed. He wanted to talk to them. On
 55257	the road he was stopped by a French sentinel who ordered him back.
 55258	
 55259	Pierre turned back, not to his companions by the campfire, but to an
 55260	unharnessed cart where there was nobody. Tucking his legs under him and
 55261	dropping his head he sat down on the cold ground by the wheel of the
 55262	cart and remained motionless a long while sunk in thought. Suddenly he
 55263	burst out into a fit of his broad, good-natured laughter, so loud that
 55264	men from various sides turned with surprise to see what this strange and
 55265	evidently solitary laughter could mean.
 55266	
 55267	âHa-ha-ha!â laughed Pierre. And he said aloud to himself: âThe soldier
 55268	did not let me pass. They took me and shut me up. They hold me captive.
 55269	What, me? Me? My immortal soul? Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!...â and he laughed
 55270	till tears started to his eyes.
 55271	
 55272	A man got up and came to see what this queer big fellow was laughing at
 55273	all by himself. Pierre stopped laughing, got up, went farther away from
 55274	the inquisitive man, and looked around him.
 55275	
 55276	The huge, endless bivouac that had previously resounded with the
 55277	crackling of campfires and the voices of many men had grown quiet, the
 55278	red campfires were growing paler and dying down. High up in the light
 55279	sky hung the full moon. Forests and fields beyond the camp, unseen
 55280	before, were now visible in the distance. And farther still, beyond
 55281	those forests and fields, the bright, oscillating, limitless distance
 55282	lured one to itself. Pierre glanced up at the sky and the twinkling
 55283	stars in its faraway depths. âAnd all that is me, all that is within me,
 55284	and it is all I!â thought Pierre. âAnd they caught all that and put it
 55285	into a shed boarded up with planks!â He smiled, and went and lay down to
 55286	sleep beside his companions.

 55292	CHAPTER XV
 55293	
 55294	In the early days of October another envoy came to KutÃºzov with a letter
 55295	from Napoleon proposing peace and falsely dated from Moscow, though
 55296	Napoleon was already not far from KutÃºzov on the old KalÃºga road.
 55297	KutÃºzov replied to this letter as he had done to the one formerly
 55298	brought by Lauriston, saying that there could be no question of peace.
 55299	
 55300	Soon after that a report was received from DÃ³rokhovâs guerrilla
 55301	detachment operating to the left of TarÃºtino that troops of Broussierâs
 55302	division had been seen at FormÃ­nsk and that being separated from the
 55303	rest of the French army they might easily be destroyed. The soldiers and
 55304	officers again demanded action. Generals on the staff, excited by the
 55305	memory of the easy victory at TarÃºtino, urged KutÃºzov to carry out
 55306	DÃ³rokhovâs suggestion. KutÃºzov did not consider any offensive necessary.
 55307	The result was a compromise which was inevitable: a small detachment was
 55308	sent to FormÃ­nsk to attack Broussier.
 55309	
 55310	By a strange coincidence, this task, which turned out to be a most
 55311	difficult and important one, was entrusted to DokhtÃºrovâthat same modest
 55312	little DokhtÃºrov whom no one had described to us as drawing up plans
 55313	of battles, dashing about in front of regiments, showering crosses on
 55314	batteries, and so on, and who was thought to be and was spoken of as
 55315	undecided and undiscerningâbut whom we find commanding wherever the
 55316	position was most difficult all through the Russo-French wars from
 55317	Austerlitz to the year 1813. At Austerlitz he remained last at the
 55318	Augezd dam, rallying the regiments, saving what was possible when all
 55319	were flying and perishing and not a single general was left in the rear
 55320	guard. Ill with fever he went to SmolÃ©nsk with twenty thousand men
 55321	to defend the town against Napoleonâs whole army. In SmolÃ©nsk, at the
 55322	MalÃ¡khov Gate, he had hardly dozed off in a paroxysm of fever before he
 55323	was awakened by the bombardment of the townâand SmolÃ©nsk held out all
 55324	day long. At the battle of BorodinÃ³, when BagratiÃ³n was killed and nine
 55325	tenths of the men of our left flank had fallen and the full force of the
 55326	French artillery fire was directed against it, the man sent there was
 55327	this same irresolute and undiscerning DokhtÃºrovâKutÃºzov hastening to
 55328	rectify a mistake he had made by sending someone else there first.
 55329	And the quiet little DokhtÃºrov rode thither, and BorodinÃ³ became the
 55330	greatest glory of the Russian army. Many heroes have been described to
 55331	us in verse and prose, but of DokhtÃºrov scarcely a word has been said.
 55332	
 55333	It was DokhtÃºrov again whom they sent to FormÃ­nsk and from there to
 55334	MÃ¡lo-YaroslÃ¡vets, the place where the last battle with the French was
 55335	fought and where the obvious disintegration of the French army began;
 55336	and we are told of many geniuses and heroes of that period of the
 55337	campaign, but of DokhtÃºrov nothing or very little is said and that
 55338	dubiously. And this silence about DokhtÃºrov is the clearest testimony to
 55339	his merit.
 55340	
 55341	It is natural for a man who does not understand the workings of a
 55342	machine to imagine that a shaving that has fallen into it by chance
 55343	and is interfering with its action and tossing about in it is its most
 55344	important part. The man who does not understand the construction of
 55345	the machine cannot conceive that the small connecting cogwheel which
 55346	revolves quietly is one of the most essential parts of the machine, and
 55347	not the shaving which merely harms and hinders the working.
 55348	
 55349	On the tenth of October when DokhtÃºrov had gone halfway to FormÃ­nsk and
 55350	stopped at the village of AristÃ³vo, preparing faithfully to execute the
 55351	orders he had received, the whole French army having, in its convulsive
 55352	movement, reached Muratâs position apparently in order to give
 55353	battleâsuddenly without any reason turned off to the left onto the new
 55354	KalÃºga road and began to enter FormÃ­nsk, where only Broussier had
 55355	been till then. At that time DokhtÃºrov had under his command, besides
 55356	DÃ³rokhovâs detachment, the two small guerrilla detachments of Figner and
 55357	SeslÃ¡vin.
 55358	
 55359	On the evening of October 11 SeslÃ¡vin came to the AristÃ³vo headquarters
 55360	with a French guardsman he had captured. The prisoner said that the
 55361	troops that had entered FormÃ­nsk that day were the vanguard of the whole
 55362	army, that Napoleon was there and the whole army had left Moscow four
 55363	days previously. That same evening a house serf who had come from
 55364	BÃ³rovsk said he had seen an immense army entering the town. Some
 55365	Cossacks of DokhtÃºrovâs detachment reported having sighted the French
 55366	Guards marching along the road to BÃ³rovsk. From all these reports it was
 55367	evident that where they had expected to meet a single division there
 55368	was now the whole French army marching from Moscow in an unexpected
 55369	directionâalong the KalÃºga road. DokhtÃºrov was unwilling to undertake
 55370	any action, as it was not clear to him now what he ought to do. He had
 55371	been ordered to attack FormÃ­nsk. But only Broussier had been there at
 55372	that time and now the whole French army was there. ErmÃ³lov wished to act
 55373	on his own judgment, but DokhtÃºrov insisted that he must have KutÃºzovâs
 55374	instructions. So it was decided to send a dispatch to the staff.
 55375	
 55376	For this purpose a capable officer, BolkhovÃ­tinov, was chosen, who
 55377	was to explain the whole affair by word of mouth, besides delivering
 55378	a written report. Toward midnight BolkhovÃ­tinov, having received the
 55379	dispatch and verbal instructions, galloped off to the General Staff
 55380	accompanied by a Cossack with spare horses.
 55381	
 55382	
 55383	
 55384	
 55385	
 55386	CHAPTER XVI
 55387	
 55388	It was a warm, dark, autumn night. It had been raining for four days.
 55389	Having changed horses twice and galloped twenty miles in an hour and a
 55390	half over a sticky, muddy road, BolkhovÃ­tinov reached LitashÃ«vka after
 55391	one oâclock at night. Dismounting at a cottage on whose wattle fence
 55392	hung a signboard, GENERAL STAFF, and throwing down his reins, he entered
 55393	a dark passage.
 55394	
 55395	âThe general on duty, quick! Itâs very important!â said he to someone
 55396	who had risen and was sniffing in the dark passage.
 55397	
 55398	âHe has been very unwell since the evening and this is the third night
 55399	he has not slept,â said the orderly pleadingly in a whisper. âYou should
 55400	wake the captain first.â
 55401	
 55402	âBut this is very important, from General DokhtÃºrov,â said
 55403	BolkhovÃ­tinov, entering the open door which he had found by feeling in
 55404	the dark.
 55405	
 55406	The orderly had gone in before him and began waking somebody.
 55407	
 55408	âYour honor, your honor! A courier.â
 55409	
 55410	âWhat? Whatâs that? From whom?â came a sleepy voice.
 55411	
 55412	âFrom DokhtÃºrov and from AlexÃ©y PetrÃ³vich. Napoleon is at FormÃ­nsk,â
 55413	said BolkhovÃ­tinov, unable to see in the dark who was speaking but
 55414	guessing by the voice that it was not KonovnÃ­tsyn.
 55415	
 55416	The man who had wakened yawned and stretched himself.
 55417	
 55418	âI donât like waking him,â he said, fumbling for something. âHe is very
 55419	ill. Perhaps this is only a rumor.â
 55420	
 55421	âHere is the dispatch,â said BolkhovÃ­tinov. âMy orders are to give it at
 55422	once to the general on duty.â
 55423	
 55424	âWait a moment, Iâll light a candle. You damned rascal, where do you
 55425	always hide it?â said the voice of the man who was stretching himself,
 55426	to the orderly. (This was ShcherbÃ­nin, KonovnÃ­tsynâs adjutant.) âIâve
 55427	found it, Iâve found it!â he added.
 55428	
 55429	The orderly was striking a light and ShcherbÃ­nin was fumbling for
 55430	something on the candlestick.
 55431	
 55432	âOh, the nasty beasts!â said he with disgust.
 55433	
 55434	By the light of the sparks BolkhovÃ­tinov saw ShcherbÃ­ninâs youthful face
 55435	as he held the candle, and the face of another man who was still asleep.
 55436	This was KonovnÃ­tsyn.
 55437	
 55438	When the flame of the sulphur splinters kindled by the tinder burned
 55439	up, first blue and then red, ShcherbÃ­nin lit the tallow candle, from
 55440	the candlestick of which the cockroaches that had been gnawing it were
 55441	running away, and looked at the messenger. BolkhovÃ­tinov was bespattered
 55442	all over with mud and had smeared his face by wiping it with his sleeve.
 55443	
 55444	âWho gave the report?â inquired ShcherbÃ­nin, taking the envelope.
 55445	
 55446	âThe news is reliable,â said BolkhovÃ­tinov. âPrisoners, Cossacks, and
 55447	the scouts all say the same thing.â
 55448	
 55449	âThereâs nothing to be done, weâll have to wake him,â said ShcherbÃ­nin,
 55450	rising and going up to the man in the nightcap who lay covered by a
 55451	greatcoat. âPeter PetrÃ³vich!â said he. (KonovnÃ­tsyn did not stir.) âTo
 55452	the General Staff!â he said with a smile, knowing that those words would
 55453	be sure to arouse him.
 55454	
 55455	And in fact the head in the nightcap was lifted at once. On
 55456	KonovnÃ­tsynâs handsome, resolute face with cheeks flushed by fever,
 55457	there still remained for an instant a faraway dreamy expression remote
 55458	from present affairs, but then he suddenly started and his face assumed
 55459	its habitual calm and firm appearance.
 55460	
 55461	âWell, what is it? From whom?â he asked immediately but without hurry,
 55462	blinking at the light.
 55463	
 55464	While listening to the officerâs report KonovnÃ­tsyn broke the seal and
 55465	read the dispatch. Hardly had he done so before he lowered his legs in
 55466	their woolen stockings to the earthen floor and began putting on his
 55467	boots. Then he took off his nightcap, combed his hair over his temples,
 55468	and donned his cap.
 55469	
 55470	âDid you get here quickly? Let us go to his Highness.â
 55471	
 55472	KonovnÃ­tsyn had understood at once that the news brought was of great
 55473	importance and that no time must be lost. He did not consider or ask
 55474	himself whether the news was good or bad. That did not interest him. He
 55475	regarded the whole business of the war not with his intelligence or his
 55476	reason but by something else. There was within him a deep unexpressed
 55477	conviction that all would be well, but that one must not trust to this
 55478	and still less speak about it, but must only attend to oneâs own work.
 55479	And he did his work, giving his whole strength to the task.
 55480	
 55481	Peter PetrÃ³vich KonovnÃ­tsyn, like DokhtÃºrov, seems to have been included
 55482	merely for proprietyâs sake in the list of the so-called heroes of
 55483	1812âthe Barclays, RaÃ©vskis, ErmÃ³lovs, PlÃ¡tovs, and MilorÃ¡doviches. Like
 55484	DokhtÃºrov he had the reputation of being a man of very limited capacity
 55485	and information, and like DokhtÃºrov he never made plans of battle but
 55486	was always found where the situation was most difficult. Since his
 55487	appointment as general on duty he had always slept with his door open,
 55488	giving orders that every messenger should be allowed to wake him up. In
 55489	battle he was always under fire, so that KutÃºzov reproved him for it and
 55490	feared to send him to the front, and like DokhtÃºrov he was one of those
 55491	unnoticed cogwheels that, without clatter or noise, constitute the most
 55492	essential part of the machine.
 55493	
 55494	Coming out of the hut into the damp, dark night KonovnÃ­tsyn
 55495	frownedâpartly from an increased pain in his head and partly at the
 55496	unpleasant thought that occurred to him, of how all that nest of
 55497	influential men on the staff would be stirred up by this news,
 55498	especially Bennigsen, who ever since TarÃºtino had been at daggers
 55499	drawn with KutÃºzov; and how they would make suggestions, quarrel, issue
 55500	orders, and rescind them. And this premonition was disagreeable to him
 55501	though he knew it could not be helped.
 55502	
 55503	And in fact Toll, to whom he went to communicate the news, immediately
 55504	began to expound his plans to a general sharing his quarters, until
 55505	KonovnÃ­tsyn, who listened in weary silence, reminded him that they must
 55506	go to see his Highness.
 55507	
 55508	
 55509	
 55510	
 55511	
 55512	CHAPTER XVII
 55513	
 55514	KutÃºzov like all old people did not sleep much at night. He often fell
 55515	asleep unexpectedly in the daytime, but at night, lying on his bed
 55516	without undressing, he generally remained awake thinking.
 55517	
 55518	So he lay now on his bed, supporting his large, heavy, scarred head on
 55519	his plump hand, with his one eye open, meditating and peering into the
 55520	darkness.
 55521	
 55522	Since Bennigsen, who corresponded with the Emperor and had more
 55523	influence than anyone else on the staff, had begun to avoid him, KutÃºzov
 55524	was more at ease as to the possibility of himself and his troops being
 55525	obliged to take part in useless aggressive movements. The lesson of the
 55526	TarÃºtino battle and of the day before it, which KutÃºzov remembered with
 55527	pain, must, he thought, have some effect on others too.
 55528	
 55529	âThey must understand that we can only lose by taking the offensive.
 55530	Patience and time are my warriors, my champions,â thought KutÃºzov. He
 55531	knew that an apple should not be plucked while it is green. It will fall
 55532	of itself when ripe, but if picked unripe the apple is spoiled, the tree
 55533	is harmed, and your teeth are set on edge. Like an experienced sportsman
 55534	he knew that the beast was wounded, and wounded as only the whole
 55535	strength of Russia could have wounded it, but whether it was mortally
 55536	wounded or not was still an undecided question. Now by the fact of
 55537	Lauriston and BarthÃ©lemi having been sent, and by the reports of the
 55538	guerrillas, KutÃºzov was almost sure that the wound was mortal. But he
 55539	needed further proofs and it was necessary to wait.
 55540	
 55541	âThey want to run to see how they have wounded it. Wait and we shall
 55542	see! Continual maneuvers, continual advances!â thought he. âWhat for?
 55543	Only to distinguish themselves! As if fighting were fun. They are
 55544	like children from whom one canât get any sensible account of what has
 55545	happened because they all want to show how well they can fight. But
 55546	thatâs not what is needed now.
 55547	
 55548	âAnd what ingenious maneuvers they all propose to me! It seems to
 55549	them that when they have thought of two or three contingenciesâ (he
 55550	remembered the general plan sent him from Petersburg) âthey have
 55551	foreseen everything. But the contingencies are endless.â
 55552	
 55553	The undecided question as to whether the wound inflicted at BorodinÃ³ was
 55554	mortal or not had hung over KutÃºzovâs head for a whole month. On the one
 55555	hand the French had occupied Moscow. On the other KutÃºzov felt assured
 55556	with all his being that the terrible blow into which he and all the
 55557	Russians had put their whole strength must have been mortal. But in any
 55558	case proofs were needed; he had waited a whole month for them and grew
 55559	more impatient the longer he waited. Lying on his bed during those
 55560	sleepless nights he did just what he reproached those younger generals
 55561	for doing. He imagined all sorts of possible contingencies, just like
 55562	the younger men, but with this difference, that he saw thousands of
 55563	contingencies instead of two or three and based nothing on them. The
 55564	longer he thought the more contingencies presented themselves. He
 55565	imagined all sorts of movements of the Napoleonic army as a whole or
 55566	in sectionsâagainst Petersburg, or against him, or to outflank him.
 55567	He thought too of the possibility (which he feared most of all) that
 55568	Napoleon might fight him with his own weapon and remain in Moscow
 55569	awaiting him. KutÃºzov even imagined that Napoleonâs army might turn back
 55570	through MedÃ½n and YukhnÃ³v, but the one thing he could not foresee was
 55571	what happenedâthe insane, convulsive stampede of Napoleonâs army during
 55572	its first eleven days after leaving Moscow: a stampede which made
 55573	possible what KutÃºzov had not yet even dared to think ofâthe complete
 55574	extermination of the French. DÃ³rokhovâs report about Broussierâs
 55575	division, the guerrillasâ reports of distress in Napoleonâs army, rumors
 55576	of preparations for leaving Moscow, all confirmed the supposition that
 55577	the French army was beaten and preparing for flight. But these were
 55578	only suppositions, which seemed important to the younger men but not to
 55579	KutÃºzov. With his sixty yearsâ experience he knew what value to attach
 55580	to rumors, knew how apt people who desire anything are to group all news
 55581	so that it appears to confirm what they desire, and he knew how readily
 55582	in such cases they omit all that makes for the contrary. And the more
 55583	he desired it the less he allowed himself to believe it. This question
 55584	absorbed all his mental powers. All else was to him only lifeâs
 55585	customary routine. To such customary routine belonged his conversations
 55586	with the staff, the letters he wrote from TarÃºtino to Madame de StaÃ«l,
 55587	the reading of novels, the distribution of awards, his correspondence
 55588	with Petersburg, and so on. But the destruction of the French, which he
 55589	alone foresaw, was his heartâs one desire.
 55590	
 55591	On the night of the eleventh of October he lay leaning on his arm and
 55592	thinking of that.
 55593	
 55594	There was a stir in the next room and he heard the steps of Toll,
 55595	KonovnÃ­tsyn, and BolkhovÃ­tinov.
 55596	
 55597	âEh, whoâs there? Come in, come in! What news?â the field marshal called
 55598	out to them.
 55599	
 55600	While a footman was lighting a candle, Toll communicated the substance
 55601	of the news.
 55602	
 55603	âWho brought it?â asked KutÃºzov with a look which, when the candle was
 55604	lit, struck Toll by its cold severity.
 55605	
 55606	âThere can be no doubt about it, your Highness.â
 55607	
 55608	âCall him in, call him here.â
 55609	
 55610	KutÃºzov sat up with one leg hanging down from the bed and his big paunch
 55611	resting against the other which was doubled under him. He screwed up his
 55612	seeing eye to scrutinize the messenger more carefully, as if wishing to
 55613	read in his face what preoccupied his own mind.
 55614	
 55615	âTell me, tell me, friend,â said he to BolkhovÃ­tinov in his low, aged
 55616	voice, as he pulled together the shirt which gaped open on his chest,
 55617	âcome nearerânearer. What news have you brought me? Eh? That Napoleon
 55618	has left Moscow? Are you sure? Eh?â
 55619	
 55620	BolkhovÃ­tinov gave a detailed account from the beginning of all he had
 55621	been told to report.
 55622	
 55623	âSpeak quicker, quicker! Donât torture me!â KutÃºzov interrupted him.
 55624	
 55625	BolkhovÃ­tinov told him everything and was then silent, awaiting
 55626	instructions. Toll was beginning to say something but KutÃºzov checked
 55627	him. He tried to say something, but his face suddenly puckered and
 55628	wrinkled; he waved his arm at Toll and turned to the opposite side of
 55629	the room, to the corner darkened by the icons that hung there.
 55630	
 55631	âO Lord, my Creator, Thou has heard our prayer...â said he in a
 55632	tremulous voice with folded hands. âRussia is saved. I thank Thee, O
 55633	Lord!â and he wept.
 55634	
 55635	
 55636	
 55637	
 55638	
 55639	CHAPTER XVIII
 55640	
 55641	From the time he received this news to the end of the campaign all
 55642	KutÃºzovâs activity was directed toward restraining his troops, by
 55643	authority, by guile, and by entreaty, from useless attacks,
 55644	maneuvers, or encounters with the perishing enemy. DokhtÃºrov went to
 55645	MÃ¡lo-YaroslÃ¡vets, but KutÃºzov lingered with the main army and gave
 55646	orders for the evacuation of KalÃºgaâa retreat beyond which town seemed
 55647	to him quite possible.
 55648	
 55649	Everywhere KutÃºzov retreated, but the enemy without waiting for his
 55650	retreat fled in the opposite direction.
 55651	
 55652	Napoleonâs historians describe to us his skilled maneuvers at TarÃºtino
 55653	and MÃ¡lo-YaroslÃ¡vets, and make conjectures as to what would have
 55654	happened had Napoleon been in time to penetrate into the rich southern
 55655	provinces.
 55656	
 55657	But not to speak of the fact that nothing prevented him from advancing
 55658	into those southern provinces (for the Russian army did not bar his
 55659	way), the historians forget that nothing could have saved his army, for
 55660	then already it bore within itself the germs of inevitable ruin. How
 55661	could that armyâwhich had found abundant supplies in Moscow and had
 55662	trampled them underfoot instead of keeping them, and on arriving at
 55663	SmolÃ©nsk had looted provisions instead of storing themâhow could that
 55664	army recuperate in KalÃºga province, which was inhabited by Russians such
 55665	as those who lived in Moscow, and where fire had the same property of
 55666	consuming what was set ablaze?
 55667	
 55668	That army could not recover anywhere. Since the battle of BorodinÃ³
 55669	and the pillage of Moscow it had borne within itself, as it were, the
 55670	chemical elements of dissolution.
 55671	
 55672	The members of what had once been an armyâNapoleon himself and all his
 55673	soldiers fledâwithout knowing whither, each concerned only to make his
 55674	escape as quickly as possible from this position, of the hopelessness of
 55675	which they were all more or less vaguely conscious.
 55676	
 55677	So it came about that at the council at MÃ¡lo-YaroslÃ¡vets, when the
 55678	generals pretending to confer together expressed various opinions, all
 55679	mouths were closed by the opinion uttered by the simple-minded soldier
 55680	Mouton who, speaking last, said what they all felt: that the one thing
 55681	needful was to get away as quickly as possible; and no one, not
 55682	even Napoleon, could say anything against that truth which they all
 55683	recognized.
 55684	
 55685	But though they all realized that it was necessary to get away, there
 55686	still remained a feeling of shame at admitting that they must flee. An
 55687	external shock was needed to overcome that shame, and this shock came in
 55688	due time. It was what the French called âle hourra de lâEmpereur.â
 55689	
 55690	The day after the council at MÃ¡lo-YaroslÃ¡vets Napoleon rode out early in
 55691	the morning amid the lines of his army with his suite of marshals and
 55692	an escort, on the pretext of inspecting the army and the scene of the
 55693	previous and of the impending battle. Some Cossacks on the prowl for
 55694	booty fell in with the Emperor and very nearly captured him. If the
 55695	Cossacks did not capture Napoleon then, what saved him was the very
 55696	thing that was destroying the French army, the booty on which the
 55697	Cossacks fell. Here as at TarÃºtino they went after plunder, leaving the
 55698	men. Disregarding Napoleon they rushed after the plunder and Napoleon
 55699	managed to escape.
 55700	
 55701	When les enfants du Don might so easily have taken the Emperor himself
 55702	in the midst of his army, it was clear that there was nothing for it but
 55703	to fly as fast as possible along the nearest, familiar road. Napoleon
 55704	with his forty-year-old stomach understood that hint, not feeling his
 55705	former agility and boldness, and under the influence of the fright
 55706	the Cossacks had given him he at once agreed with Mouton and issued
 55707	ordersâas the historians tell usâto retreat by the SmolÃ©nsk road.
 55708	
 55709	That Napoleon agreed with Mouton, and that the army retreated, does
 55710	not prove that Napoleon caused it to retreat, but that the forces which
 55711	influenced the whole army and directed it along the MozhÃ¡ysk (that is,
 55712	the SmolÃ©nsk) road acted simultaneously on him also.

 55718	CHAPTER XIX
 55719	
 55720	A man in motion always devises an aim for that motion. To be able to go
 55721	a thousand miles he must imagine that something good awaits him at the
 55722	end of those thousand miles. One must have the prospect of a promised
 55723	land to have the strength to move.
 55724	
 55725	The promised land for the French during their advance had been Moscow,
 55726	during their retreat it was their native land. But that native land
 55727	was too far off, and for a man going a thousand miles it is absolutely
 55728	necessary to set aside his final goal and to say to himself: âToday I
 55729	shall get to a place twenty-five miles off where I shall rest and
 55730	spend the night,â and during the first dayâs journey that resting place
 55731	eclipses his ultimate goal and attracts all his hopes and desires. And
 55732	the impulses felt by a single person are always magnified in a crowd.
 55733	
 55734	For the French retreating along the old SmolÃ©nsk road, the final
 55735	goalâtheir native landâwas too remote, and their immediate goal
 55736	was SmolÃ©nsk, toward which all their desires and hopes, enormously
 55737	intensified in the mass, urged them on. It was not that they knew that
 55738	much food and fresh troops awaited them in SmolÃ©nsk, nor that they were
 55739	told so (on the contrary their superior officers, and Napoleon himself,
 55740	knew that provisions were scarce there), but because this alone could
 55741	give them strength to move on and endure their present privations. So
 55742	both those who knew and those who did not know deceived themselves, and
 55743	pushed on to SmolÃ©nsk as to a promised land.
 55744	
 55745	Coming out onto the highroad the French fled with surprising energy
 55746	and unheard-of rapidity toward the goal they had fixed on. Besides the
 55747	common impulse which bound the whole crowd of French into one mass and
 55748	supplied them with a certain energy, there was another cause binding
 55749	them togetherâtheir great numbers. As with the physical law of gravity,
 55750	their enormous mass drew the individual human atoms to itself. In their
 55751	hundreds of thousands they moved like a whole nation.
 55752	
 55753	Each of them desired nothing more than to give himself up as a prisoner
 55754	to escape from all this horror and misery; but on the one hand the force
 55755	of this common attraction to SmolÃ©nsk, their goal, drew each of them in
 55756	the same direction; on the other hand an army corps could not surrender
 55757	to a company, and though the French availed themselves of every
 55758	convenient opportunity to detach themselves and to surrender on the
 55759	slightest decent pretext, such pretexts did not always occur. Their
 55760	very numbers and their crowded and swift movement deprived them of that
 55761	possibility and rendered it not only difficult but impossible for the
 55762	Russians to stop this movement, to which the French were directing all
 55763	their energies. Beyond a certain limit no mechanical disruption of the
 55764	body could hasten the process of decomposition.
 55765	
 55766	A lump of snow cannot be melted instantaneously. There is a certain
 55767	limit of time in less than which no amount of heat can melt the snow. On
 55768	the contrary the greater the heat the more solidified the remaining snow
 55769	becomes.
 55770	
 55771	Of the Russian commanders KutÃºzov alone understood this. When the flight
 55772	of the French army along the SmolÃ©nsk road became well defined, what
 55773	KonovnÃ­tsyn had foreseen on the night of the eleventh of October began
 55774	to occur. The superior officers all wanted to distinguish themselves,
 55775	to cut off, to seize, to capture, and to overthrow the French, and all
 55776	clamored for action.
 55777	
 55778	KutÃºzov alone used all his power (and such power is very limited in the
 55779	case of any commander in chief) to prevent an attack.
 55780	
 55781	He could not tell them what we say now: âWhy fight, why block the road,
 55782	losing our own men and inhumanly slaughtering unfortunate wretches? What
 55783	is the use of that, when a third of their army has melted away on the
 55784	road from Moscow to VyÃ¡zma without any battle?â But drawing from his
 55785	aged wisdom what they could understand, he told them of the golden
 55786	bridge, and they laughed at and slandered him, flinging themselves on,
 55787	rending and exulting over the dying beast.
 55788	
 55789	ErmÃ³lov, MilorÃ¡dovich, PlÃ¡tov, and others in proximity to the French
 55790	near VyÃ¡zma could not resist their desire to cut off and break up two
 55791	French corps, and by way of reporting their intention to KutÃºzov they
 55792	sent him a blank sheet of paper in an envelope.
 55793	
 55794	And try as KutÃºzov might to restrain the troops, our men attacked,
 55795	trying to bar the road. Infantry regiments, we are told, advanced to the
 55796	attack with music and with drums beating, and killed and lost thousands
 55797	of men.
 55798	
 55799	But they did not cut off or overthrow anybody and the French army,
 55800	closing up more firmly at the danger, continued, while steadily melting
 55801	away, to pursue its fatal path to SmolÃ©nsk.

 55812	
 55813	CHAPTER I
 55814	
 55815	The Battle of BorodinÃ³, with the occupation of Moscow that followed it
 55816	and the flight of the French without further conflicts, is one of the
 55817	most instructive phenomena in history.
 55818	
 55819	All historians agree that the external activity of states and nations
 55820	in their conflicts with one another is expressed in wars, and that as a
 55821	direct result of greater or less success in war the political strength
 55822	of states and nations increases or decreases.
 55823	
 55824	Strange as may be the historical account of how some king or emperor,
 55825	having quarreled with another, collects an army, fights his enemyâs
 55826	army, gains a victory by killing three, five, or ten thousand men, and
 55827	subjugates a kingdom and an entire nation of several millions, all
 55828	the facts of history (as far as we know it) confirm the truth of the
 55829	statement that the greater or lesser success of one army against another
 55830	is the cause, or at least an essential indication, of an increase or
 55831	decrease in the strength of the nationâeven though it is unintelligible
 55832	why the defeat of an armyâa hundredth part of a nationâshould oblige
 55833	that whole nation to submit. An army gains a victory, and at once the
 55834	rights of the conquering nation have increased to the detriment of the
 55835	defeated. An army has suffered defeat, and at once a people loses its
 55836	rights in proportion to the severity of the reverse, and if its army
 55837	suffers a complete defeat the nation is quite subjugated.
 55838	
 55839	So according to history it has been found from the most ancient times,
 55840	and so it is to our own day. All Napoleonâs wars serve to confirm this
 55841	rule. In proportion to the defeat of the Austrian army Austria loses
 55842	its rights, and the rights and the strength of France increase. The
 55843	victories of the French at Jena and AuerstÃ¤dt destroy the independent
 55844	existence of Prussia.
 55845	
 55846	But then, in 1812, the French gain a victory near Moscow. Moscow is
 55847	taken and after that, with no further battles, it is not Russia that
 55848	ceases to exist, but the French army of six hundred thousand, and
 55849	then Napoleonic France itself. To strain the facts to fit the rules of
 55850	history: to say that the field of battle at BorodinÃ³ remained in the
 55851	hands of the Russians, or that after Moscow there were other battles
 55852	that destroyed Napoleonâs army, is impossible.
 55853	
 55854	After the French victory at BorodinÃ³ there was no general engagement nor
 55855	any that were at all serious, yet the French army ceased to exist. What
 55856	does this mean? If it were an example taken from the history of China,
 55857	we might say that it was not an historic phenomenon (which is the
 55858	historiansâ usual expedient when anything does not fit their standards);
 55859	if the matter concerned some brief conflict in which only a small number
 55860	of troops took part, we might treat it as an exception; but this event
 55861	occurred before our fathersâ eyes, and for them it was a question of the
 55862	life or death of their fatherland, and it happened in the greatest of
 55863	all known wars.
 55864	
 55865	The period of the campaign of 1812 from the battle of BorodinÃ³ to the
 55866	expulsion of the French proved that the winning of a battle does not
 55867	produce a conquest and is not even an invariable indication of conquest;
 55868	it proved that the force which decides the fate of peoples lies not in
 55869	the conquerors, nor even in armies and battles, but in something else.
 55870	
 55871	The French historians, describing the condition of the French army
 55872	before it left Moscow, affirm that all was in order in the Grand Army,
 55873	except the cavalry, the artillery, and the transportâthere was no forage
 55874	for the horses or the cattle. That was a misfortune no one could remedy,
 55875	for the peasants of the district burned their hay rather than let the
 55876	French have it.
 55877	
 55878	The victory gained did not bring the usual results because the peasants
 55879	Karp and Vlas (who after the French had evacuated Moscow drove in their
 55880	carts to pillage the town, and in general personally failed to manifest
 55881	any heroic feelings), and the whole innumerable multitude of such
 55882	peasants, did not bring their hay to Moscow for the high price offered
 55883	them, but burned it instead.
 55884	
 55885	Let us imagine two men who have come out to fight a duel with rapiers
 55886	according to all the rules of the art of fencing. The fencing has
 55887	gone on for some time; suddenly one of the combatants, feeling himself
 55888	wounded and understanding that the matter is no joke but concerns his
 55889	life, throws down his rapier, and seizing the first cudgel that comes to
 55890	hand begins to brandish it. Then let us imagine that the combatant who
 55891	so sensibly employed the best and simplest means to attain his end was
 55892	at the same time influenced by traditions of chivalry and, desiring to
 55893	conceal the facts of the case, insisted that he had gained his victory
 55894	with the rapier according to all the rules of art. One can imagine what
 55895	confusion and obscurity would result from such an account of the duel.
 55896	
 55897	The fencer who demanded a contest according to the rules of fencing was
 55898	the French army; his opponent who threw away the rapier and snatched up
 55899	the cudgel was the Russian people; those who try to explain the matter
 55900	according to the rules of fencing are the historians who have described
 55901	the event.
 55902	
 55903	After the burning of SmolÃ©nsk a war began which did not follow any
 55904	previous traditions of war. The burning of towns and villages, the
 55905	retreats after battles, the blow dealt at BorodinÃ³ and the renewed
 55906	retreat, the burning of Moscow, the capture of marauders, the seizure of
 55907	transports, and the guerrilla war were all departures from the rules.
 55908	
 55909	Napoleon felt this, and from the time he took up the correct fencing
 55910	attitude in Moscow and instead of his opponentâs rapier saw a cudgel
 55911	raised above his head, he did not cease to complain to KutÃºzov and to
 55912	the Emperor Alexander that the war was being carried on contrary to all
 55913	the rulesâas if there were any rules for killing people. In spite of the
 55914	complaints of the French as to the nonobservance of the rules, in
 55915	spite of the fact that to some highly placed Russians it seemed rather
 55916	disgraceful to fight with a cudgel and they wanted to assume a pose en
 55917	quarte or en tierce according to all the rules, and to make an adroit
 55918	thrust en prime, and so onâthe cudgel of the peopleâs war was lifted
 55919	with all its menacing and majestic strength, and without consulting
 55920	anyoneâs tastes or rules and regardless of anything else, it rose and
 55921	fell with stupid simplicity, but consistently, and belabored the French
 55922	till the whole invasion had perished.
 55923	
 55924	And it is well for a people who do notâas the French did in 1813âsalute
 55925	according to all the rules of art, and, presenting the hilt of their
 55926	rapier gracefully and politely, hand it to their magnanimous conqueror,
 55927	but at the moment of trial, without asking what rules others have
 55928	adopted in similar cases, simply and easily pick up the first cudgel
 55929	that comes to hand and strike with it till the feeling of resentment and
 55930	revenge in their soul yields to a feeling of contempt and compassion.
 55931	
 55932	
 55933	
 55934	
 55935	
 55936	CHAPTER II
 55937	
 55938	One of the most obvious and advantageous departures from the so-called
 55939	laws of war is the action of scattered groups against men pressed
 55940	together in a mass. Such action always occurs in wars that take on a
 55941	national character. In such actions, instead of two crowds opposing
 55942	each other, the men disperse, attack singly, run away when attacked by
 55943	stronger forces, but again attack when opportunity offers. This was done
 55944	by the guerrillas in Spain, by the mountain tribes in the Caucasus, and
 55945	by the Russians in 1812.
 55946	
 55947	People have called this kind of war âguerrilla warfareâ and assume that
 55948	by so calling it they have explained its meaning. But such a war does
 55949	not fit in under any rule and is directly opposed to a well-known rule
 55950	of tactics which is accepted as infallible. That rule says that an
 55951	attacker should concentrate his forces in order to be stronger than his
 55952	opponent at the moment of conflict.
 55953	
 55954	Guerrilla war (always successful, as history shows) directly infringes
 55955	that rule.
 55956	
 55957	This contradiction arises from the fact that military science assumes
 55958	the strength of an army to be identical with its numbers. Military
 55959	science says that the more troops the greater the strength. Les gros
 55960	bataillons ont toujours raison. *
 55961	
 55962	    * Large battalions are always victorious.
 55963	
 55964	For military science to say this is like defining momentum in mechanics
 55965	by reference to the mass only: stating that momenta are equal or unequal
 55966	to each other simply because the masses involved are equal or unequal.
 55967	
 55968	Momentum (quantity of motion) is the product of mass and velocity.
 55969	
 55970	In military affairs the strength of an army is the product of its mass
 55971	and some unknown x.
 55972	
 55973	Military science, seeing in history innumerable instances of the fact
 55974	that the size of any army does not coincide with its strength and that
 55975	small detachments defeat larger ones, obscurely admits the existence
 55976	of this unknown factor and tries to discover itânow in a geometric
 55977	formation, now in the equipment employed, now, and most usually, in the
 55978	genius of the commanders. But the assignment of these various meanings
 55979	to the factor does not yield results which accord with the historic
 55980	facts.
 55981	
 55982	Yet it is only necessary to abandon the false view (adopted to gratify
 55983	the âheroesâ) of the efficacy of the directions issued in wartime by
 55984	commanders, in order to find this unknown quantity.
 55985	
 55986	That unknown quantity is the spirit of the army, that is to say, the
 55987	greater or lesser readiness to fight and face danger felt by all the men
 55988	composing an army, quite independently of whether they are, or are not,
 55989	fighting under the command of a genius, in twoâor three-line formation,
 55990	with cudgels or with rifles that repeat thirty times a minute. Men
 55991	who want to fight will always put themselves in the most advantageous
 55992	conditions for fighting.
 55993	
 55994	The spirit of an army is the factor which multiplied by the mass gives
 55995	the resulting force. To define and express the significance of this
 55996	unknown factorâthe spirit of an armyâis a problem for science.
 55997	
 55998	This problem is only solvable if we cease arbitrarily to substitute
 55999	for the unknown x itself the conditions under which that force becomes
 56000	apparentâsuch as the commands of the general, the equipment employed,
 56001	and so onâmistaking these for the real significance of the factor,
 56002	and if we recognize this unknown quantity in its entirety as being
 56003	the greater or lesser desire to fight and to face danger. Only then,
 56004	expressing known historic facts by equations and comparing the relative
 56005	significance of this factor, can we hope to define the unknown.
 56006	
 56007	Ten men, battalions, or divisions, fighting fifteen men, battalions, or
 56008	divisions, conquerâthat is, kill or take captiveâall the others, while
 56009	themselves losing four, so that on the one side four and on the other
 56010	fifteen were lost. Consequently the four were equal to the fifteen, and
 56011	therefore 4x = 15y. Consequently x/y = 15/4. This equation does not
 56012	give us the value of the unknown factor but gives us a ratio between two
 56013	unknowns. And by bringing variously selected historic units (battles,
 56014	campaigns, periods of war) into such equations, a series of numbers
 56015	could be obtained in which certain laws should exist and might be
 56016	discovered.
 56017	
 56018	The tactical rule that an army should act in masses when attacking, and
 56019	in smaller groups in retreat, unconsciously confirms the truth that the
 56020	strength of an army depends on its spirit. To lead men forward under
 56021	fire more discipline (obtainable only by movement in masses) is needed
 56022	than is needed to resist attacks. But this rule which leaves out of
 56023	account the spirit of the army continually proves incorrect and is in
 56024	particularly striking contrast to the facts when some strong rise or
 56025	fall in the spirit of the troops occurs, as in all national wars.
 56026	
 56027	The French, retreating in 1812âthough according to tactics they should
 56028	have separated into detachments to defend themselvesâcongregated into
 56029	a mass because the spirit of the army had so fallen that only the mass
 56030	held the army together. The Russians, on the contrary, ought according
 56031	to tactics to have attacked in mass, but in fact they split up
 56032	into small units, because their spirit had so risen that separate
 56033	individuals, without orders, dealt blows at the French without needing
 56034	any compulsion to induce them to expose themselves to hardships and
 56035	dangers.
 56036	
 56037	
 56038	
 56039	
 56040	
 56041	CHAPTER III
 56042	
 56043	The so-called partisan war began with the entry of the French into
 56044	SmolÃ©nsk.
 56045	
 56046	Before partisan warfare had been officially recognized by the
 56047	government, thousands of enemy stragglers, marauders, and foragers had
 56048	been destroyed by the Cossacks and the peasants, who killed them off
 56049	as instinctively as dogs worry a stray mad dog to death. DenÃ­s DavÃ½dov,
 56050	with his Russian instinct, was the first to recognize the value of
 56051	this terrible cudgel which regardless of the rules of military science
 56052	destroyed the French, and to him belongs the credit for taking the first
 56053	step toward regularizing this method of warfare.
 56054	
 56055	On August 24 DavÃ½dovâs first partisan detachment was formed and then
 56056	others were recognized. The further the campaign progressed the more
 56057	numerous these detachments became.
 56058	
 56059	The irregulars destroyed the great army piecemeal. They gathered the
 56060	fallen leaves that dropped of themselves from that withered treeâthe
 56061	French armyâand sometimes shook that tree itself. By October, when
 56062	the French were fleeing toward SmolÃ©nsk, there were hundreds of such
 56063	companies, of various sizes and characters. There were some that adopted
 56064	all the army methods and had infantry, artillery, staffs, and the
 56065	comforts of life. Others consisted solely of Cossack cavalry. There were
 56066	also small scratch groups of foot and horse, and groups of peasants and
 56067	landowners that remained unknown. A sacristan commanded one party which
 56068	captured several hundred prisoners in the course of a month; and there
 56069	was VasÃ­lisa, the wife of a village elder, who slew hundreds of the
 56070	French.
 56071	
 56072	The partisan warfare flamed up most fiercely in the latter days of
 56073	October. Its first period had passed: when the partisans themselves,
 56074	amazed at their own boldness, feared every minute to be surrounded
 56075	and captured by the French, and hid in the forests without unsaddling,
 56076	hardly daring to dismount and always expecting to be pursued. By the end
 56077	of October this kind of warfare had taken definite shape: it had become
 56078	clear to all what could be ventured against the French and what could
 56079	not. Now only the commanders of detachments with staffs, and moving
 56080	according to rules at a distance from the French, still regarded many
 56081	things as impossible. The small bands that had started their activities
 56082	long before and had already observed the French closely considered
 56083	things possible which the commanders of the big detachments did not dare
 56084	to contemplate. The Cossacks and peasants who crept in among the French
 56085	now considered everything possible.
 56086	
 56087	On October 22, DenÃ­sov (who was one of the irregulars) was with his
 56088	group at the height of the guerrilla enthusiasm. Since early morning he
 56089	and his party had been on the move. All day long he had been watching
 56090	from the forest that skirted the highroad a large French convoy of
 56091	cavalry baggage and Russian prisoners separated from the rest of the
 56092	army, whichâas was learned from spies and prisonersâwas moving under a
 56093	strong escort to SmolÃ©nsk. Besides DenÃ­sov and DÃ³lokhov (who also led
 56094	a small party and moved in DenÃ­sovâs vicinity), the commanders of some
 56095	large divisions with staffs also knew of this convoy and, as DenÃ­sov
 56096	expressed it, were sharpening their teeth for it. Two of the commanders
 56097	of large partiesâone a Pole and the other a Germanâsent invitations
 56098	to DenÃ­sov almost simultaneously, requesting him to join up with their
 56099	divisions to attack the convoy.
 56100	
 56101	âNo, bwother, I have gwown mustaches myself,â said DenÃ­sov on reading
 56102	these documents, and he wrote to the German that, despite his heartfelt
 56103	desire to serve under so valiant and renowned a general, he had to forgo
 56104	that pleasure because he was already under the command of the Polish
 56105	general. To the Polish general he replied to the same effect, informing
 56106	him that he was already under the command of the German.
 56107	
 56108	Having arranged matters thus, DenÃ­sov and DÃ³lokhov intended, without
 56109	reporting matters to the higher command, to attack and seize that
 56110	convoy with their own small forces. On October 22 it was moving from
 56111	the village of MikÃºlino to that of ShÃ¡mshevo. To the left of the road
 56112	between MikÃºlino and ShÃ¡mshevo there were large forests, extending in
 56113	some places up to the road itself though in others a mile or more back
 56114	from it. Through these forests DenÃ­sov and his party rode all day,
 56115	sometimes keeping well back in them and sometimes coming to the very
 56116	edge, but never losing sight of the moving French. That morning,
 56117	Cossacks of DenÃ­sovâs party had seized and carried off into the forest
 56118	two wagons loaded with cavalry saddles, which had stuck in the mud not
 56119	far from MikÃºlino where the forest ran close to the road. Since then,
 56120	and until evening, the party had watched the movements of the French
 56121	without attacking. It was necessary to let the French reach ShÃ¡mshevo
 56122	quietly without alarming them and then, after joining DÃ³lokhov who was
 56123	to come that evening to a consultation at a watchmanâs hut in the forest
 56124	less than a mile from ShÃ¡mshevo, to surprise the French at dawn, falling
 56125	like an avalanche on their heads from two sides, and rout and capture
 56126	them all at one blow.
 56127	
 56128	In their rear, more than a mile from MikÃºlino where the forest came
 56129	right up to the road, six Cossacks were posted to report if any fresh
 56130	columns of French should show themselves.
 56131	
 56132	Beyond ShÃ¡mshevo, DÃ³lokhov was to observe the road in the same way, to
 56133	find out at what distance there were other French troops. They reckoned
 56134	that the convoy had fifteen hundred men. DenÃ­sov had two hundred, and
 56135	DÃ³lokhov might have as many more, but the disparity of numbers did not
 56136	deter DenÃ­sov. All that he now wanted to know was what troops these were
 56137	and to learn that he had to capture a âtongueââthat is, a man from
 56138	the enemy column. That morningâs attack on the wagons had been made so
 56139	hastily that the Frenchmen with the wagons had all been killed; only a
 56140	little drummer boy had been taken alive, and as he was a straggler he
 56141	could tell them nothing definite about the troops in that column.
 56142	
 56143	DenÃ­sov considered it dangerous to make a second attack for fear of
 56144	putting the whole column on the alert, so he sent TÃ­khon ShcherbÃ¡ty, a
 56145	peasant of his party, to ShÃ¡mshevo to try and seize at least one of the
 56146	French quartermasters who had been sent on in advance.
 56147	
 56148	
 56149	
 56150	
 56151	
 56152	CHAPTER IV
 56153	
 56154	It was a warm rainy autumn day. The sky and the horizon were both
 56155	the color of muddy water. At times a sort of mist descended, and then
 56156	suddenly heavy slanting rain came down.
 56157	
 56158	DenÃ­sov in a felt cloak and a sheepskin cap from which the rain ran down
 56159	was riding a thin thoroughbred horse with sunken sides. Like his horse,
 56160	which turned its head and laid its ears back, he shrank from the driving
 56161	rain and gazed anxiously before him. His thin face with its short, thick
 56162	black beard looked angry.
 56163	
 56164	Beside DenÃ­sov rode an esaul, * DenÃ­sovâs fellow worker, also in felt
 56165	cloak and sheepskin cap, and riding a large sleek Don horse.
 56166	
 56167	    * A captain of Cossacks.
 56168	
 56169	Esaul LovÃ¡yski the Third was a tall man as straight as an arrow,
 56170	pale-faced, fair-haired, with narrow light eyes and with calm
 56171	self-satisfaction in his face and bearing. Though it was impossible to
 56172	say in what the peculiarity of the horse and rider lay, yet at first
 56173	glance at the esaul and DenÃ­sov one saw that the latter was wet and
 56174	uncomfortable and was a man mounted on a horse, while looking at the
 56175	esaul one saw that he was as comfortable and as much at ease as always
 56176	and that he was not a man who had mounted a horse, but a man who was one
 56177	with his horse, a being consequently possessed of twofold strength.
 56178	
 56179	A little ahead of them walked a peasant guide, wet to the skin and
 56180	wearing a gray peasant coat and a white knitted cap.
 56181	
 56182	A little behind, on a poor, small, lean KirghÃ­z mount with an enormous
 56183	tail and mane and a bleeding mouth, rode a young officer in a blue
 56184	French overcoat.
 56185	
 56186	Beside him rode an hussar, with a boy in a tattered French uniform and
 56187	blue cap behind him on the crupper of his horse. The boy held on to the
 56188	hussar with cold, red hands, and raising his eyebrows gazed about him
 56189	with surprise. This was the French drummer boy captured that morning.
 56190	
 56191	Behind them along the narrow, sodden, cutup forest road came hussars in
 56192	threes and fours, and then Cossacks: some in felt cloaks, some in French
 56193	greatcoats, and some with horsecloths over their heads. The horses,
 56194	being drenched by the rain, all looked black whether chestnut or bay.
 56195	Their necks, with their wet, close-clinging manes, looked strangely
 56196	thin. Steam rose from them. Clothes, saddles, reins, were all wet,
 56197	slippery, and sodden, like the ground and the fallen leaves that strewed
 56198	the road. The men sat huddled up trying not to stir, so as to warm the
 56199	water that had trickled to their bodies and not admit the fresh cold
 56200	water that was leaking in under their seats, their knees, and at the
 56201	back of their necks. In the midst of the outspread line of Cossacks two
 56202	wagons, drawn by French horses and by saddled Cossack horses that had
 56203	been hitched on in front, rumbled over the tree stumps and branches and
 56204	splashed through the water that lay in the ruts.
 56205	
 56206	DenÃ­sovâs horse swerved aside to avoid a pool in the track and bumped
 56207	his riderâs knee against a tree.
 56208	
 56209	âOh, the devil!â exclaimed DenÃ­sov angrily, and showing his teeth he
 56210	struck his horse three times with his whip, splashing himself and his
 56211	comrades with mud.
 56212	
 56213	DenÃ­sov was out of sorts both because of the rain and also from hunger
 56214	(none of them had eaten anything since morning), and yet more because he
 56215	still had no news from DÃ³lokhov and the man sent to capture a âtongueâ
 56216	had not returned.
 56217	
 56218	âThereâll hardly be another such chance to fall on a transport as today.
 56219	Itâs too risky to attack them by oneself, and if we put it off till
 56220	another day one of the big guerrilla detachments will snatch the prey
 56221	from under our noses,â thought DenÃ­sov, continually peering forward,
 56222	hoping to see a messenger from DÃ³lokhov.
 56223	
 56224	On coming to a path in the forest along which he could see far to the
 56225	right, DenÃ­sov stopped.
 56226	
 56227	âThereâs someone coming,â said he.
 56228	
 56229	The esaul looked in the direction DenÃ­sov indicated.
 56230	
 56231	âThere are two, an officer and a Cossack. But it is not presupposable
 56232	that it is the lieutenant colonel himself,â said the esaul, who was fond
 56233	of using words the Cossacks did not know.
 56234	
 56235	The approaching riders having descended a decline were no longer
 56236	visible, but they reappeared a few minutes later. In front, at a weary
 56237	gallop and using his leather whip, rode an officer, disheveled and
 56238	drenched, whose trousers had worked up to above his knees. Behind him,
 56239	standing in the stirrups, trotted a Cossack. The officer, a very young
 56240	lad with a broad rosy face and keen merry eyes, galloped up to DenÃ­sov
 56241	and handed him a sodden envelope.
 56242	
 56243	âFrom the general,â said the officer. âPlease excuse its not being quite
 56244	dry.â
 56245	
 56246	DenÃ­sov, frowning, took the envelope and opened it.
 56247	
 56248	âThere, they kept telling us: âItâs dangerous, itâs dangerous,ââ
 56249	said the officer, addressing the esaul while DenÃ­sov was reading the
 56250	dispatch. âBut KomarÃ³v and Iââhe pointed to the Cossackââwere prepared.
 56251	We have each of us two pistols.... But whatâs this?â he asked, noticing
 56252	the French drummer boy. âA prisoner? Youâve already been in action? May
 56253	I speak to him?â
 56254	
 56255	âWostÃ³v! PÃ©tya!â exclaimed DenÃ­sov, having run through the dispatch.
 56256	âWhy didnât you say who you were?â and turning with a smile he held out
 56257	his hand to the lad.
 56258	
 56259	The officer was PÃ©tya RostÃ³v.
 56260	
 56261	All the way PÃ©tya had been preparing himself to behave with DenÃ­sov as
 56262	befitted a grown-up man and an officerâwithout hinting at their previous
 56263	acquaintance. But as soon as DenÃ­sov smiled at him PÃ©tya brightened
 56264	up, blushed with pleasure, forgot the official manner he had been
 56265	rehearsing, and began telling him how he had already been in a battle
 56266	near VyÃ¡zma and how a certain hussar had distinguished himself there.
 56267	
 56268	âWell, I am glad to see you,â DenÃ­sov interrupted him, and his face
 56269	again assumed its anxious expression.
 56270	
 56271	âMichael FeoklÃ­tych,â said he to the esaul, âthis is again fwom that
 56272	German, you know. Heââhe indicated PÃ©tyaââis serving under him.â
 56273	
 56274	And DenÃ­sov told the esaul that the dispatch just delivered was a
 56275	repetition of the German generalâs demand that he should join forces
 56276	with him for an attack on the transport.
 56277	
 56278	âIf we donât take it tomowwow, heâll snatch it fwom under our noses,â he
 56279	added.
 56280	
 56281	While DenÃ­sov was talking to the esaul, PÃ©tyaâabashed by DenÃ­sovâs
 56282	cold tone and supposing that it was due to the condition of his
 56283	trousersâfurtively tried to pull them down under his greatcoat so
 56284	that no one should notice it, while maintaining as martial an air as
 56285	possible.
 56286	
 56287	âWill there be any orders, your honor?â he asked DenÃ­sov, holding his
 56288	hand at the salute and resuming the game of adjutant and general for
 56289	which he had prepared himself, âor shall I remain with your honor?â
 56290	
 56291	âOrders?â DenÃ­sov repeated thoughtfully. âBut can you stay till
 56292	tomowwow?â
 56293	
 56294	âOh, please... May I stay with you?â cried PÃ©tya.
 56295	
 56296	âBut, just what did the genewal tell you? To weturn at once?â asked
 56297	DenÃ­sov.
 56298	
 56299	PÃ©tya blushed.
 56300	
 56301	âHe gave me no instructions. I think I could?â he returned, inquiringly.
 56302	
 56303	âWell, all wight,â said DenÃ­sov.
 56304	
 56305	And turning to his men he directed a party to go on to the halting place
 56306	arranged near the watchmanâs hut in the forest, and told the officer on
 56307	the KirghÃ­z horse (who performed the duties of an adjutant) to go and
 56308	find out where DÃ³lokhov was and whether he would come that evening.
 56309	DenÃ­sov himself intended going with the esaul and PÃ©tya to the edge of
 56310	the forest where it reached out to ShÃ¡mshevo, to have a look at the part
 56311	of the French bivouac they were to attack next day.
 56312	
 56313	âWell, old fellow,â said he to the peasant guide, âlead us to
 56314	ShÃ¡mshevo.â
 56315	
 56316	DenÃ­sov, PÃ©tya, and the esaul, accompanied by some Cossacks and the
 56317	hussar who had the prisoner, rode to the left across a ravine to the
 56318	edge of the forest.
 56319	
 56320	
 56321	
 56322	
 56323	
 56324	CHAPTER V
 56325	
 56326	The rain had stopped, and only the mist was falling and drops from
 56327	the trees. DenÃ­sov, the esaul, and PÃ©tya rode silently, following the
 56328	peasant in the knitted cap who, stepping lightly with outturned toes
 56329	and moving noiselessly in his bast shoes over the roots and wet leaves,
 56330	silently led them to the edge of the forest.
 56331	
 56332	He ascended an incline, stopped, looked about him, and advanced to where
 56333	the screen of trees was less dense. On reaching a large oak tree that
 56334	had not yet shed its leaves, he stopped and beckoned mysteriously to
 56335	them with his hand.
 56336	
 56337	DenÃ­sov and PÃ©tya rode up to him. From the spot where the peasant was
 56338	standing they could see the French. Immediately beyond the forest, on a
 56339	downward slope, lay a field of spring rye. To the right, beyond a steep
 56340	ravine, was a small village and a landownerâs house with a broken roof.
 56341	In the village, in the house, in the garden, by the well, by the pond,
 56342	over all the rising ground, and all along the road uphill from the
 56343	bridge leading to the village, not more than five hundred yards
 56344	away, crowds of men could be seen through the shimmering mist. Their
 56345	un-Russian shouting at their horses which were straining uphill with the
 56346	carts, and their calls to one another, could be clearly heard.
 56347	
 56348	âBwing the prisoner here,â said DenÃ­sov in a low voice, not taking his
 56349	eyes off the French.
 56350	
 56351	A Cossack dismounted, lifted the boy down, and took him to DenÃ­sov.
 56352	Pointing to the French troops, DenÃ­sov asked him what these and those
 56353	of them were. The boy, thrusting his cold hands into his pockets and
 56354	lifting his eyebrows, looked at DenÃ­sov in affright, but in spite of
 56355	an evident desire to say all he knew gave confused answers, merely
 56356	assenting to everything DenÃ­sov asked him. DenÃ­sov turned away from him
 56357	frowning and addressed the esaul, conveying his own conjectures to him.
 56358	
 56359	PÃ©tya, rapidly turning his head, looked now at the drummer boy, now
 56360	at DenÃ­sov, now at the esaul, and now at the French in the village and
 56361	along the road, trying not to miss anything of importance.
 56362	
 56363	âWhether DÃ³lokhov comes or not, we must seize it, eh?â said DenÃ­sov with
 56364	a merry sparkle in his eyes.
 56365	
 56366	âIt is a very suitable spot,â said the esaul.
 56367	
 56368	âWeâll send the infantwy down by the swamps,â DenÃ­sov continued.
 56369	âTheyâll cweep up to the garden; youâll wide up fwom there with the
 56370	Cossacksââhe pointed to a spot in the forest beyond the villageââand I
 56371	with my hussars fwom here. And at the signal shot...â
 56372	
 56373	âThe hollow is impassableâthereâs a swamp there,â said the esaul. âThe
 56374	horses would sink. We must ride round more to the left....â
 56375	
 56376	While they were talking in undertones the crack of a shot sounded
 56377	from the low ground by the pond, a puff of white smoke appeared, then
 56378	another, and the sound of hundreds of seemingly merry French voices
 56379	shouting together came up from the slope. For a moment DenÃ­sov and the
 56380	esaul drew back. They were so near that they thought they were the cause
 56381	of the firing and shouting. But the firing and shouting did not relate
 56382	to them. Down below, a man wearing something red was running through the
 56383	marsh. The French were evidently firing and shouting at him.
 56384	
 56385	âWhy, thatâs our TÃ­khon,â said the esaul.
 56386	
 56387	âSo it is! It is!â
 56388	
 56389	âThe wascal!â said DenÃ­sov.
 56390	
 56391	âHeâll get away!â said the esaul, screwing up his eyes.
 56392	
 56393	The man whom they called TÃ­khon, having run to the stream, plunged in
 56394	so that the water splashed in the air, and, having disappeared for an
 56395	instant, scrambled out on all fours, all black with the wet, and ran on.
 56396	The French who had been pursuing him stopped.
 56397	
 56398	âSmart, that!â said the esaul.
 56399	
 56400	âWhat a beast!â said DenÃ­sov with his former look of vexation. âWhat has
 56401	he been doing all this time?â
 56402	
 56403	âWho is he?â asked PÃ©tya.
 56404	
 56405	âHeâs our plastÃºn. I sent him to capture a âtongue.ââ
 56406	
 56407	âOh, yes,â said PÃ©tya, nodding at the first words DenÃ­sov uttered as if
 56408	he understood it all, though he really did not understand anything of
 56409	it.
 56410	
 56411	TÃ­khon ShcherbÃ¡ty was one of the most indispensable men in their band.
 56412	He was a peasant from PokrÃ³vsk, near the river Gzhat. When DenÃ­sov had
 56413	come to PokrÃ³vsk at the beginning of his operations and had as usual
 56414	summoned the village elder and asked him what he knew about the French,
 56415	the elder, as though shielding himself, had replied, as all village
 56416	elders did, that he had neither seen nor heard anything of them. But
 56417	when DenÃ­sov explained that his purpose was to kill the French, and
 56418	asked if no French had strayed that way, the elder replied that some
 56419	âmore-orderersâ had really been at their village, but that TÃ­khon
 56420	ShcherbÃ¡ty was the only man who dealt with such matters. DenÃ­sov had
 56421	TÃ­khon called and, having praised him for his activity, said a few words
 56422	in the elderâs presence about loyalty to the Tsar and the country and
 56423	the hatred of the French that all sons of the fatherland should cherish.
 56424	
 56425	âWe donât do the French any harm,â said TÃ­khon, evidently frightened by
 56426	DenÃ­sovâs words. âWe only fooled about with the lads for fun, you know!
 56427	We killed a score or so of âmore-orderers,â but we did no harm else....â
 56428	
 56429	Next day when DenÃ­sov had left PokrÃ³vsk, having quite forgotten about
 56430	this peasant, it was reported to him that TÃ­khon had attached himself
 56431	to their party and asked to be allowed to remain with it. DenÃ­sov gave
 56432	orders to let him do so.
 56433	
 56434	TÃ­khon, who at first did rough work, laying campfires, fetching water,
 56435	flaying dead horses, and so on, soon showed a great liking and aptitude
 56436	for partisan warfare. At night he would go out for booty and always
 56437	brought back French clothing and weapons, and when told to would bring
 56438	in French captives also. DenÃ­sov then relieved him from drudgery and
 56439	began taking him with him when he went out on expeditions and had him
 56440	enrolled among the Cossacks.
 56441	
 56442	TÃ­khon did not like riding, and always went on foot, never lagging
 56443	behind the cavalry. He was armed with a musketoon (which he carried
 56444	rather as a joke), a pike and an ax, which latter he used as a wolf uses
 56445	its teeth, with equal ease picking fleas out of its fur or crunching
 56446	thick bones. TÃ­khon with equal accuracy would split logs with blows at
 56447	armâs length, or holding the head of the ax would cut thin little pegs
 56448	or carve spoons. In DenÃ­sovâs party he held a peculiar and exceptional
 56449	position. When anything particularly difficult or nasty had to be
 56450	doneâto push a cart out of the mud with oneâs shoulders, pull a horse
 56451	out of a swamp by its tail, skin it, slink in among the French, or walk
 56452	more than thirty miles in a dayâeverybody pointed laughingly at TÃ­khon.
 56453	
 56454	âIt wonât hurt that devilâheâs as strong as a horse!â they said of him.
 56455	
 56456	Once a Frenchman TÃ­khon was trying to capture fired a pistol at him
 56457	and shot him in the fleshy part of the back. That wound (which TÃ­khon
 56458	treated only with internal and external applications of vodka) was the
 56459	subject of the liveliest jokes by the whole detachmentâjokes in which
 56460	TÃ­khon readily joined.
 56461	
 56462	âHallo, mate! Never again? Gave you a twist?â the Cossacks would banter
 56463	him. And TÃ­khon, purposely writhing and making faces, pretended to be
 56464	angry and swore at the French with the funniest curses. The only effect
 56465	of this incident on TÃ­khon was that after being wounded he seldom
 56466	brought in prisoners.
 56467	
 56468	He was the bravest and most useful man in the party. No one found more
 56469	opportunities for attacking, no one captured or killed more Frenchmen,
 56470	and consequently he was made the buffoon of all the Cossacks and hussars
 56471	and willingly accepted that role. Now he had been sent by DenÃ­sov
 56472	overnight to ShÃ¡mshevo to capture a âtongue.â But whether because he
 56473	had not been content to take only one Frenchman or because he had slept
 56474	through the night, he had crept by day into some bushes right among the
 56475	French and, as DenÃ­sov had witnessed from above, had been detected by
 56476	them.
 56477

 56481	
 56482	CHAPTER VI
 56483	
 56484	After talking for some time with the esaul about next dayâs attack,
 56485	which now, seeing how near they were to the French, he seemed to have
 56486	definitely decided on, DenÃ­sov turned his horse and rode back.
 56487	
 56488	âNow, my lad, weâll go and get dwy,â he said to PÃ©tya.
 56489	
 56490	As they approached the watchhouse DenÃ­sov stopped, peering into the
 56491	forest. Among the trees a man with long legs and long, swinging arms,
 56492	wearing a short jacket, bast shoes, and a KazÃ¡n hat, was approaching
 56493	with long, light steps. He had a musketoon over his shoulder and an ax
 56494	stuck in his girdle. When he espied DenÃ­sov he hastily threw something
 56495	into the bushes, removed his sodden hat by its floppy brim, and
 56496	approached his commander. It was TÃ­khon. His wrinkled and pockmarked
 56497	face and narrow little eyes beamed with self-satisfied merriment. He
 56498	lifted his head high and gazed at DenÃ­sov as if repressing a laugh.
 56499	
 56500	âWell, where did you disappear to?â inquired DenÃ­sov.
 56501	
 56502	âWhere did I disappear to? I went to get Frenchmen,â answered TÃ­khon
 56503	boldly and hurriedly, in a husky but melodious bass voice.
 56504	
 56505	âWhy did you push yourself in there by daylight? You ass! Well, why
 56506	havenât you taken one?â
 56507	
 56508	âOh, I took one all right,â said TÃ­khon.
 56509	
 56510	âWhere is he?â
 56511	
 56512	âYou see, I took him first thing at dawn,â TÃ­khon continued, spreading
 56513	out his flat feet with outturned toes in their bast shoes. âI took him
 56514	into the forest. Then I see heâs no good and think Iâll go and fetch a
 56515	likelier one.â
 56516	
 56517	âYou see?... What a wogueâitâs just as I thought,â said DenÃ­sov to the
 56518	esaul. âWhy didnât you bwing that one?â
 56519	
 56520	âWhat was the good of bringing him?â TÃ­khon interrupted hastily and
 56521	angrilyââthat one wouldnât have done for you. As if I donât know what
 56522	sort you want!â
 56523	
 56524	âWhat a bwute you are!... Well?â
 56525	
 56526	âI went for another one,â TÃ­khon continued, âand I crept like this
 56527	through the wood and lay down.â (He suddenly lay down on his stomach
 56528	with a supple movement to show how he had done it.) âOne turned up and
 56529	I grabbed him, like this.â (He jumped up quickly and lightly.) ââCome
 56530	along to the colonel,â I said. He starts yelling, and suddenly there
 56531	were four of them. They rushed at me with their little swords. So I went
 56532	for them with my ax, this way: âWhat are you up to?â says I. âChrist
 56533	be with you!ââ shouted TÃ­khon, waving his arms with an angry scowl and
 56534	throwing out his chest.
 56535	
 56536	âYes, we saw from the hill how you took to your heels through the
 56537	puddles!â said the esaul, screwing up his glittering eyes.
 56538	
 56539	PÃ©tya badly wanted to laugh, but noticed that they all refrained from
 56540	laughing. He turned his eyes rapidly from TÃ­khonâs face to the esaulâs
 56541	and DenÃ­sovâs, unable to make out what it all meant.
 56542	
 56543	âDonât play the fool!â said DenÃ­sov, coughing angrily. âWhy didnât you
 56544	bwing the first one?â
 56545	
 56546	TÃ­khon scratched his back with one hand and his head with the other,
 56547	then suddenly his whole face expanded into a beaming, foolish grin,
 56548	disclosing a gap where he had lost a tooth (that was why he was called
 56549	ShcherbÃ¡tyâthe gap-toothed). DenÃ­sov smiled, and PÃ©tya burst into a peal
 56550	of merry laughter in which TÃ­khon himself joined.
 56551	
 56552	âOh, but he was a regular good-for-nothing,â said TÃ­khon. âThe clothes
 56553	on himâpoor stuff! How could I bring him? And so rude, your honor! Why,
 56554	he says: âIâm a generalâs son myself, I wonât go!â he says.â
 56555	
 56556	âYou are a bwute!â said DenÃ­sov. âI wanted to question...â
 56557	
 56558	âBut I questioned him,â said TÃ­khon. âHe said he didnât know much.
 56559	âThere are a lot of us,â he says, âbut all poor stuffâonly soldiers in
 56560	name,â he says. âShout loud at them,â he says, âand youâll take
 56561	them all,ââ TÃ­khon concluded, looking cheerfully and resolutely into
 56562	DenÃ­sovâs eyes.
 56563	
 56564	âIâll give you a hundwed sharp lashesâthatâll teach you to play the
 56565	fool!â said DenÃ­sov severely.
 56566	
 56567	âBut why are you angry?â remonstrated TÃ­khon, âjust as if Iâd never seen
 56568	your Frenchmen! Only wait till it gets dark and Iâll fetch you any of
 56569	them you wantâthree if you like.â
 56570	
 56571	âWell, letâs go,â said DenÃ­sov, and rode all the way to the watchhouse
 56572	in silence and frowning angrily.
 56573	
 56574	TÃ­khon followed behind and PÃ©tya heard the Cossacks laughing with him
 56575	and at him, about some pair of boots he had thrown into the bushes.
 56576	
 56577	When the fit of laughter that had seized him at TÃ­khonâs words and smile
 56578	had passed and PÃ©tya realized for a moment that this TÃ­khon had killed a
 56579	man, he felt uneasy. He looked round at the captive drummer boy and felt
 56580	a pang in his heart. But this uneasiness lasted only a moment. He felt
 56581	it necessary to hold his head higher, to brace himself, and to question
 56582	the esaul with an air of importance about tomorrowâs undertaking, that
 56583	he might not be unworthy of the company in which he found himself.
 56584	
 56585	The officer who had been sent to inquire met DenÃ­sov on the way with the
 56586	news that DÃ³lokhov was soon coming and that all was well with him.
 56587	
 56588	DenÃ­sov at once cheered up and, calling PÃ©tya to him, said: âWell, tell
 56589	me about yourself.â
 56590	
 56591	
 56592	
 56593	
 56594	
 56595	CHAPTER VII
 56596	
 56597	PÃ©tya, having left his people after their departure from Moscow, joined
 56598	his regiment and was soon taken as orderly by a general commanding a
 56599	large guerrilla detachment. From the time he received his commission,
 56600	and especially since he had joined the active army and taken part in
 56601	the battle of VyÃ¡zma, PÃ©tya had been in a constant state of blissful
 56602	excitement at being grown-up and in a perpetual ecstatic hurry not to
 56603	miss any chance to do something really heroic. He was highly delighted
 56604	with what he saw and experienced in the army, but at the same time
 56605	it always seemed to him that the really heroic exploits were being
 56606	performed just where he did not happen to be. And he was always in a
 56607	hurry to get where he was not.
 56608	
 56609	When on the twenty-first of October his general expressed a wish to send
 56610	somebody to DenÃ­sovâs detachment, PÃ©tya begged so piteously to be sent
 56611	that the general could not refuse. But when dispatching him he recalled
 56612	PÃ©tyaâs mad action at the battle of VyÃ¡zma, where instead of riding by
 56613	the road to the place to which he had been sent, he had galloped to the
 56614	advanced line under the fire of the French and had there twice fired
 56615	his pistol. So now the general explicitly forbade his taking part in any
 56616	action whatever of DenÃ­sovâs. That was why PÃ©tya had blushed and grown
 56617	confused when DenÃ­sov asked him whether he could stay. Before they had
 56618	ridden to the outskirts of the forest PÃ©tya had considered he must carry
 56619	out his instructions strictly and return at once. But when he saw the
 56620	French and saw TÃ­khon and learned that there would certainly be an
 56621	attack that night, he decided, with the rapidity with which young people
 56622	change their views, that the general, whom he had greatly respected till
 56623	then, was a rubbishy German, that DenÃ­sov was a hero, the esaul a hero,
 56624	and TÃ­khon a hero too, and that it would be shameful for him to leave
 56625	them at a moment of difficulty.
 56626	
 56627	It was already growing dusk when DenÃ­sov, PÃ©tya, and the esaul rode up
 56628	to the watchhouse. In the twilight saddled horses could be seen, and
 56629	Cossacks and hussars who had rigged up rough shelters in the glade and
 56630	were kindling glowing fires in a hollow of the forest where the French
 56631	could not see the smoke. In the passage of the small watchhouse a
 56632	Cossack with sleeves rolled up was chopping some mutton. In the room
 56633	three officers of DenÃ­sovâs band were converting a door into a tabletop.
 56634	PÃ©tya took off his wet clothes, gave them to be dried, and at once began
 56635	helping the officers to fix up the dinner table.
 56636	
 56637	In ten minutes the table was ready and a napkin spread on it. On the
 56638	table were vodka, a flask of rum, white bread, roast mutton, and salt.
 56639	
 56640	Sitting at table with the officers and tearing the fat savory mutton
 56641	with his hands, down which the grease trickled, PÃ©tya was in an ecstatic
 56642	childish state of love for all men, and consequently of confidence that
 56643	others loved him in the same way.
 56644	
 56645	âSo then what do you think, VasÃ­li DmÃ­trich?â said he to DenÃ­sov. âItâs
 56646	all right my staying a day with you?â And not waiting for a reply he
 56647	answered his own question: âYou see I was told to find outâwell, I am
 56648	finding out.... Only do let me into the very... into the chief... I
 56649	donât want a reward.... But I want...â
 56650	
 56651	PÃ©tya clenched his teeth and looked around, throwing back his head and
 56652	flourishing his arms.
 56653	
 56654	âInto the vewy chief...â DenÃ­sov repeated with a smile.
 56655	
 56656	âOnly, please let me command something, so that I may really command...â
 56657	PÃ©tya went on. âWhat would it be to you?... Oh, you want a knife?â he
 56658	said, turning to an officer who wished to cut himself a piece of mutton.
 56659	
 56660	And he handed him his clasp knife. The officer admired it.
 56661	
 56662	âPlease keep it. I have several like it,â said PÃ©tya, blushing.
 56663	âHeavens! I was quite forgetting!â he suddenly cried. âI have some
 56664	raisins, fine ones; you know, seedless ones. We have a new sutler and
 56665	he has such capital things. I bought ten pounds. I am used to something
 56666	sweet. Would you like some?...â and PÃ©tya ran out into the passage to
 56667	his Cossack and brought back some bags which contained about five pounds
 56668	of raisins. âHave some, gentlemen, have some!â
 56669	
 56670	âYou want a coffeepot, donât you?â he asked the esaul. âI bought a
 56671	capital one from our sutler! He has splendid things. And heâs very
 56672	honest, thatâs the chief thing. Iâll be sure to send it to you. Or
 56673	perhaps your flints are giving out, or are worn outâthat happens
 56674	sometimes, you know. I have brought some with me, here they areââand he
 56675	showed a bagââa hundred flints. I bought them very cheap. Please take as
 56676	many as you want, or all if you like....â
 56677	
 56678	Then suddenly, dismayed lest he had said too much, PÃ©tya stopped and
 56679	blushed.
 56680	
 56681	He tried to remember whether he had not done anything else that was
 56682	foolish. And running over the events of the day he remembered the French
 56683	drummer boy. âItâs capital for us here, but what of him? Where have they
 56684	put him? Have they fed him? Havenât they hurt his feelings?â he thought.
 56685	But having caught himself saying too much about the flints, he was now
 56686	afraid to speak out.
 56687	
 56688	âI might ask,â he thought, âbut theyâll say: âHeâs a boy himself and so
 56689	he pities the boy.â Iâll show them tomorrow whether Iâm a boy. Will it
 56690	seem odd if I ask?â PÃ©tya thought. âWell, never mind!â and immediately,
 56691	blushing and looking anxiously at the officers to see if they appeared
 56692	ironical, he said:
 56693	
 56694	âMay I call in that boy who was taken prisoner and give him something to
 56695	eat?... Perhaps...â
 56696	
 56697	âYes, heâs a poor little fellow,â said DenÃ­sov, who evidently saw
 56698	nothing shameful in this reminder. âCall him in. His name is Vincent
 56699	Bosse. Have him fetched.â
 56700	
 56701	âIâll call him,â said PÃ©tya.
 56702	
 56703	âYes, yes, call him. A poor little fellow,â DenÃ­sov repeated.
 56704	
 56705	PÃ©tya was standing at the door when DenÃ­sov said this. He slipped in
 56706	between the officers, came close to DenÃ­sov, and said:
 56707	
 56708	âLet me kiss you, dear old fellow! Oh, how fine, how splendid!â
 56709	
 56710	And having kissed DenÃ­sov he ran out of the hut.
 56711	
 56712	âBosse! Vincent!â PÃ©tya cried, stopping outside the door.
 56713	
 56714	âWho do you want, sir?â asked a voice in the darkness.
 56715	
 56716	PÃ©tya replied that he wanted the French lad who had been captured that
 56717	day.
 56718	
 56719	âAh, VesÃ©nny?â said a Cossack.
 56720	
 56721	Vincent, the boyâs name, had already been changed by the Cossacks into
 56722	VesÃ©nny (vernal) and into VesÃ©nya by the peasants and soldiers. In both
 56723	these adaptations the reference to spring (vesnÃ¡) matched the impression
 56724	made by the young lad.
 56725	
 56726	âHe is warming himself there by the bonfire. Ho, VesÃ©nya!
 56727	VesÃ©nya!âVesÃ©nny!â laughing voices were heard calling to one another in
 56728	the darkness.
 56729	
 56730	âHeâs a smart lad,â said an hussar standing near PÃ©tya. âWe gave him
 56731	something to eat a while ago. He was awfully hungry!â
 56732	
 56733	The sound of bare feet splashing through the mud was heard in the
 56734	darkness, and the drummer boy came to the door.
 56735	
 56736	âAh, câest vous!â said PÃ©tya. âVoulez-vous manger? Nâayez pas peur, on
 56737	ne vous fera pas de mal,â * he added shyly and affectionately, touching
 56738	the boyâs hand. âEntrez, entrez.â *(2)
 56739	
 56740	     * âAh, itâs you! Do you want something to eat? Donât be
 56741	     afraid, they wonât hurt you.â
 56742	
 56743	     * (2) âCome in, come in.â
 56744	
 56745	
 56746	âMerci, monsieur,â * said the drummer boy in a trembling almost childish
 56747	voice, and he began scraping his dirty feet on the threshold.
 56748	
 56749	    * âThank you, sir.â
 56750	
 56751	
 56752	There were many things PÃ©tya wanted to say to the drummer boy, but did
 56753	not dare to. He stood irresolutely beside him in the passage. Then in
 56754	the darkness he took the boyâs hand and pressed it.
 56755	
 56756	âCome in, come in!â he repeated in a gentle whisper. âOh, what can I do
 56757	for him?â he thought, and opening the door he let the boy pass in first.
 56758	
 56759	When the boy had entered the hut, PÃ©tya sat down at a distance from
 56760	him, considering it beneath his dignity to pay attention to him. But
 56761	he fingered the money in his pocket and wondered whether it would seem
 56762	ridiculous to give some to the drummer boy.
 56763	
 56764	
 56765	
 56766	
 56767	
 56768	CHAPTER VIII
 56769	
 56770	The arrival of DÃ³lokhov diverted PÃ©tyaâs attention from the drummer boy,
 56771	to whom DenÃ­sov had had some mutton and vodka given, and whom he had had
 56772	dressed in a Russian coat so that he might be kept with their band and
 56773	not sent away with the other prisoners. PÃ©tya had heard in the army many
 56774	stories of DÃ³lokhovâs extraordinary bravery and of his cruelty to the
 56775	French, so from the moment he entered the hut PÃ©tya did not take his
 56776	eyes from him, but braced himself up more and more and held his head
 56777	high, that he might not be unworthy even of such company.
 56778	
 56779	DÃ³lokhovâs appearance amazed PÃ©tya by its simplicity.
 56780	
 56781	DenÃ­sov wore a Cossack coat, had a beard, had an icon of Nicholas the
 56782	Wonder-Worker on his breast, and his way of speaking and everything he
 56783	did indicated his unusual position. But DÃ³lokhov, who in Moscow had worn
 56784	a Persian costume, had now the appearance of a most correct officer of
 56785	the Guards. He was clean-shaven and wore a Guardsmanâs padded coat with
 56786	an Order of St. George at his buttonhole and a plain forage cap set
 56787	straight on his head. He took off his wet felt cloak in a corner of
 56788	the room, and without greeting anyone went up to DenÃ­sov and began
 56789	questioning him about the matter in hand. DenÃ­sov told him of the
 56790	designs the large detachments had on the transport, of the message PÃ©tya
 56791	had brought, and his own replies to both generals. Then he told him all
 56792	he knew of the French detachment.
 56793	
 56794	âThatâs so. But we must know what troops they are and their numbers,â
 56795	said DÃ³lokhov. âIt will be necessary to go there. We canât start the
 56796	affair without knowing for certain how many there are. I like to work
 56797	accurately. Here nowâwouldnât one of these gentlemen like to ride over
 56798	to the French camp with me? I have brought a spare uniform.â
 56799	
 56800	âI, I... Iâll go with you!â cried PÃ©tya.
 56801	
 56802	âThereâs no need for you to go at all,â said DenÃ­sov, addressing
 56803	DÃ³lokhov, âand as for him, I wonât let him go on any account.â
 56804	
 56805	âI like that!â exclaimed PÃ©tya. âWhy shouldnât I go?â
 56806	
 56807	âBecause itâs useless.â
 56808	
 56809	âWell, you must excuse me, because... because... I shall go, and thatâs
 56810	all. Youâll take me, wonât you?â he said, turning to DÃ³lokhov.
 56811	
 56812	âWhy not?â DÃ³lokhov answered absently, scrutinizing the face of the
 56813	French drummer boy. âHave you had that youngster with you long?â he
 56814	asked DenÃ­sov.
 56815	
 56816	âHe was taken today but he knows nothing. Iâm keeping him with me.â
 56817	
 56818	âYes, and where do you put the others?â inquired DÃ³lokhov.
 56819	
 56820	âWhere? I send them away and take a weceipt for them,â shouted DenÃ­sov,
 56821	suddenly flushing. âAnd I say boldly that I have not a single manâs life
 56822	on my conscience. Would it be difficult for you to send thirty or
 56823	thwee hundwed men to town under escort, instead of stainingâI speak
 56824	bluntlyâstaining the honor of a soldier?â
 56825	
 56826	âThat kind of amiable talk would be suitable from this young count of
 56827	sixteen,â said DÃ³lokhov with cold irony, âbut itâs time for you to drop
 56828	it.â
 56829	
 56830	âWhy, Iâve not said anything! I only say that Iâll certainly go with
 56831	you,â said PÃ©tya shyly.
 56832	
 56833	âBut for you and me, old fellow, itâs time to drop these amenities,â
 56834	continued DÃ³lokhov, as if he found particular pleasure in speaking of
 56835	this subject which irritated DenÃ­sov. âNow, why have you kept this lad?â
 56836	he went on, swaying his head. âBecause you are sorry for him! Donât we
 56837	know those âreceiptsâ of yours? You send a hundred men away, and thirty
 56838	get there. The rest either starve or get killed. So isnât it all the
 56839	same not to send them?â
 56840	
 56841	The esaul, screwing up his light-colored eyes, nodded approvingly.
 56842	
 56843	âThatâs not the point. Iâm not going to discuss the matter. I do not
 56844	wish to take it on my conscience. You say theyâll die. All wight. Only
 56845	not by my fault!â
 56846	
 56847	DÃ³lokhov began laughing.
 56848	
 56849	âWho has told them not to capture me these twenty times over? But if
 56850	they did catch me theyâd string me up to an aspen tree, and with all
 56851	your chivalry just the same.â He paused. âHowever, we must get to work.
 56852	Tell the Cossack to fetch my kit. I have two French uniforms in it.
 56853	Well, are you coming with me?â he asked PÃ©tya.
 56854	
 56855	âI? Yes, yes, certainly!â cried PÃ©tya, blushing almost to tears and
 56856	glancing at DenÃ­sov.
 56857	
 56858	While DÃ³lokhov had been disputing with DenÃ­sov what should be done with
 56859	prisoners, PÃ©tya had once more felt awkward and restless; but again he
 56860	had no time to grasp fully what they were talking about. âIf grown-up,
 56861	distinguished men think so, it must be necessary and right,â thought he.
 56862	âBut above all DenÃ­sov must not dare to imagine that Iâll obey him and
 56863	that he can order me about. I will certainly go to the French camp with
 56864	DÃ³lokhov. If he can, so can I!â
 56865	
 56866	And to all DenÃ­sovâs persuasions, PÃ©tya replied that he too was
 56867	accustomed to do everything accurately and not just anyhow, and that he
 56868	never considered personal danger.
 56869	
 56870	âFor youâll admit that if we donât know for sure how many of them there
 56871	are... hundreds of lives may depend on it, while there are only two
 56872	of us. Besides, I want to go very much and certainly will go, so donât
 56873	hinder me,â said he. âIt will only make things worse....â
 56874	
 56875	
 56876	
 56877	
 56878	
 56879	CHAPTER IX
 56880	
 56881	Having put on French greatcoats and shakos, PÃ©tya and DÃ³lokhov rode to
 56882	the clearing from which DenÃ­sov had reconnoitered the French camp,
 56883	and emerging from the forest in pitch darkness they descended into the
 56884	hollow. On reaching the bottom, DÃ³lokhov told the Cossacks accompanying
 56885	him to await him there and rode on at a quick trot along the road to the
 56886	bridge. PÃ©tya, his heart in his mouth with excitement, rode by his side.
 56887	
 56888	âIf weâre caught, I wonât be taken alive! I have a pistol,â whispered
 56889	he.
 56890	
 56891	âDonât talk Russian,â said DÃ³lokhov in a hurried whisper, and at that
 56892	very moment they heard through the darkness the challenge: âQui vive?â *
 56893	and the click of a musket.
 56894	
 56895	    * âWho goes there?â
 56896	
 56897	
 56898	The blood rushed to PÃ©tyaâs face and he grasped his pistol.
 56899	
 56900	âLanciers du 6-me,â * replied DÃ³lokhov, neither hastening nor slackening
 56901	his horseâs pace.
 56902	
 56903	    * âLancers of the 6th Regiment.â
 56904	
 56905	
 56906	The black figure of a sentinel stood on the bridge.
 56907	
 56908	âMot dâordre.â *
 56909	
 56910	    * âPassword.â
 56911	
 56912	
 56913	DÃ³lokhov reined in his horse and advanced at a walk.
 56914	
 56915	âDites donc, le colonel GÃ©rard est ici?â * he asked.
 56916	
 56917	    * âTell me, is Colonel GÃ©rard here?â
 56918	
 56919	
 56920	âMot dâordre,â repeated the sentinel, barring the way and not replying.
 56921	
 56922	âQuand un officier fait sa ronde, les sentinelles ne demandent pas le
 56923	mot dâordre...â cried DÃ³lokhov suddenly flaring up and riding straight
 56924	at the sentinel. âJe vous demande si le colonel est ici.â *
 56925	
 56926	     * âWhen an officer is making his round, sentinels donât ask
 56927	     him for the password.... I am asking you if the colonel is
 56928	     here.â
 56929	
 56930	
 56931	And without waiting for an answer from the sentinel, who had stepped
 56932	aside, DÃ³lokhov rode up the incline at a walk.
 56933	
 56934	Noticing the black outline of a man crossing the road, DÃ³lokhov stopped
 56935	him and inquired where the commander and officers were. The man,
 56936	a soldier with a sack over his shoulder, stopped, came close up to
 56937	DÃ³lokhovâs horse, touched it with his hand, and explained simply and in
 56938	a friendly way that the commander and the officers were higher up
 56939	the hill to the right in the courtyard of the farm, as he called the
 56940	landownerâs house.
 56941	
 56942	Having ridden up the road, on both sides of which French talk could be
 56943	heard around the campfires, DÃ³lokhov turned into the courtyard of the
 56944	landownerâs house. Having ridden in, he dismounted and approached a
 56945	big blazing campfire, around which sat several men talking noisily.
 56946	Something was boiling in a small cauldron at the edge of the fire and
 56947	a soldier in a peaked cap and blue overcoat, lit up by the fire, was
 56948	kneeling beside it stirring its contents with a ramrod.
 56949	
 56950	âOh, heâs a hard nut to crack,â said one of the officers who was sitting
 56951	in the shadow at the other side of the fire.
 56952	
 56953	âHeâll make them get a move on, those fellows!â said another, laughing.
 56954	
 56955	Both fell silent, peering out through the darkness at the sound of
 56956	DÃ³lokhovâs and PÃ©tyaâs steps as they advanced to the fire leading their
 56957	horses.
 56958	
 56959	âBonjour, messieurs!â * said DÃ³lokhov loudly and clearly.
 56960	
 56961	    * âGood day, gentlemen.â
 56962	
 56963	
 56964	There was a stir among the officers in the shadow beyond the fire,
 56965	and one tall, long-necked officer, walking round the fire, came up to
 56966	DÃ³lokhov.
 56967	
 56968	âIs that you, ClÃ©ment?â he asked. âWhere the devil...?â But, noticing
 56969	his mistake, he broke off short and, with a frown, greeted DÃ³lokhov as a
 56970	stranger, asking what he could do for him.
 56971	
 56972	DÃ³lokhov said that he and his companion were trying to overtake their
 56973	regiment, and addressing the company in general asked whether they knew
 56974	anything of the 6th Regiment. None of them knew anything, and PÃ©tya
 56975	thought the officers were beginning to look at him and DÃ³lokhov with
 56976	hostility and suspicion. For some seconds all were silent.
 56977	
 56978	âIf you were counting on the evening soup, you have come too late,â said
 56979	a voice from behind the fire with a repressed laugh.
 56980	
 56981	DÃ³lokhov replied that they were not hungry and must push on farther that
 56982	night.
 56983	
 56984	He handed the horses over to the soldier who was stirring the pot and
 56985	squatted down on his heels by the fire beside the officer with the long
 56986	neck. That officer did not take his eyes from DÃ³lokhov and again asked
 56987	to what regiment he belonged. DÃ³lokhov, as if he had not heard the
 56988	question, did not reply, but lighting a short French pipe which he took
 56989	from his pocket began asking the officer in how far the road before them
 56990	was safe from Cossacks.
 56991	
 56992	âThose brigands are everywhere,â replied an officer from behind the
 56993	fire.
 56994	
 56995	DÃ³lokhov remarked that the Cossacks were a danger only to stragglers
 56996	such as his companion and himself, âbut probably they would not dare to
 56997	attack large detachments?â he added inquiringly. No one replied.
 56998	
 56999	âWell, now heâll come away,â PÃ©tya thought every moment as he stood by
 57000	the campfire listening to the talk.
 57001	
 57002	But DÃ³lokhov restarted the conversation which had dropped and began
 57003	putting direct questions as to how many men there were in the battalion,
 57004	how many battalions, and how many prisoners. Asking about the Russian
 57005	prisoners with that detachment, DÃ³lokhov said:
 57006	
 57007	âA horrid business dragging these corpses about with one! It would be
 57008	better to shoot such rabble,â and burst into loud laughter, so strange
 57009	that PÃ©tya thought the French would immediately detect their disguise,
 57010	and involuntarily took a step back from the campfire.
 57011	
 57012	No one replied a word to DÃ³lokhovâs laughter, and a French officer whom
 57013	they could not see (he lay wrapped in a greatcoat) rose and whispered
 57014	something to a companion. DÃ³lokhov got up and called to the soldier who
 57015	was holding their horses.
 57016	
 57017	âWill they bring our horses or not?â thought PÃ©tya, instinctively
 57018	drawing nearer to DÃ³lokhov.
 57019	
 57020	The horses were brought.
 57021	
 57022	âGood evening, gentlemen,â said DÃ³lokhov.
 57023	
 57024	PÃ©tya wished to say âGood nightâ but could not utter a word. The
 57025	officers were whispering together. DÃ³lokhov was a long time mounting
 57026	his horse which would not stand still, then he rode out of the yard at a
 57027	footpace. PÃ©tya rode beside him, longing to look round to see whether or
 57028	not the French were running after them, but not daring to.
 57029	
 57030	Coming out onto the road DÃ³lokhov did not ride back across the open
 57031	country, but through the village. At one spot he stopped and listened.
 57032	âDo you hear?â he asked. PÃ©tya recognized the sound of Russian voices
 57033	and saw the dark figures of Russian prisoners round their campfires.
 57034	When they had descended to the bridge PÃ©tya and DÃ³lokhov rode past the
 57035	sentinel, who without saying a word paced morosely up and down it, then
 57036	they descended into the hollow where the Cossacks awaited them.
 57037	
 57038	âWell now, good-by. Tell DenÃ­sov, âat the first shot at daybreak,ââ said
 57039	DÃ³lokhov and was about to ride away, but PÃ©tya seized hold of him.
 57040	
 57041	âReally!â he cried, âyou are such a hero! Oh, how fine, how splendid!
 57042	How I love you!â
 57043	
 57044	âAll right, all right!â said DÃ³lokhov. But PÃ©tya did not let go of him
 57045	and DÃ³lokhov saw through the gloom that PÃ©tya was bending toward him and
 57046	wanted to kiss him. DÃ³lokhov kissed him, laughed, turned his horse, and
 57047	vanished into the darkness.
 57048	
 57049	
 57050	
 57051	
 57052	
 57053	CHAPTER X
 57054	
 57055	Having returned to the watchmanâs hut, PÃ©tya found DenÃ­sov in the
 57056	passage. He was awaiting PÃ©tyaâs return in a state of agitation,
 57057	anxiety, and self-reproach for having let him go.
 57058	
 57059	âThank God!â he exclaimed. âYes, thank God!â he repeated, listening to
 57060	PÃ©tyaâs rapturous account. âBut, devil take you, I havenât slept because
 57061	of you! Well, thank God. Now lie down. We can still get a nap before
 57062	morning.â
 57063	
 57064	âBut... no,â said PÃ©tya, âI donât want to sleep yet. Besides I know
 57065	myself, if I fall asleep itâs finished. And then I am used to not
 57066	sleeping before a battle.â
 57067	
 57068	He sat awhile in the hut joyfully recalling the details of his
 57069	expedition and vividly picturing to himself what would happen next day.
 57070	
 57071	Then, noticing that DenÃ­sov was asleep, he rose and went out of doors.
 57072	
 57073	It was still quite dark outside. The rain was over, but drops were still
 57074	falling from the trees. Near the watchmanâs hut the black shapes of the
 57075	Cossacksâ shanties and of horses tethered together could be seen. Behind
 57076	the hut the dark shapes of the two wagons with their horses beside them
 57077	were discernible, and in the hollow the dying campfire gleamed red.
 57078	Not all the Cossacks and hussars were asleep; here and there, amid the
 57079	sounds of falling drops and the munching of the horses near by, could be
 57080	heard low voices which seemed to be whispering.
 57081	
 57082	PÃ©tya came out, peered into the darkness, and went up to the wagons.
 57083	Someone was snoring under them, and around them stood saddled horses
 57084	munching their oats. In the dark PÃ©tya recognized his own horse, which
 57085	he called âKarabÃ¡khâ though it was of Ukranian breed, and went up to it.
 57086	
 57087	âWell, KarabÃ¡kh! Weâll do some service tomorrow,â said he, sniffing its
 57088	nostrils and kissing it.
 57089	
 57090	âWhy arenât you asleep, sir?â said a Cossack who was sitting under a
 57091	wagon.
 57092	
 57093	âNo, ah... LikhachÃ«vâisnât that your name? Do you know I have only just
 57094	come back! Weâve been into the French camp.â
 57095	
 57096	And PÃ©tya gave the Cossack a detailed account not only of his ride but
 57097	also of his object, and why he considered it better to risk his life
 57098	than to act âjust anyhow.â
 57099	
 57100	âWell, you should get some sleep now,â said the Cossack.
 57101	
 57102	âNo, I am used to this,â said PÃ©tya. âI say, arenât the flints in your
 57103	pistols worn out? I brought some with me. Donât you want any? You can
 57104	have some.â
 57105	
 57106	The Cossack bent forward from under the wagon to get a closer look at
 57107	PÃ©tya.
 57108	
 57109	âBecause I am accustomed to doing everything accurately,â said PÃ©tya.
 57110	âSome fellows do things just anyhow, without preparation, and then
 57111	theyâre sorry for it afterwards. I donât like that.â
 57112	
 57113	âJust so,â said the Cossack.
 57114	
 57115	âOh yes, another thing! Please, my dear fellow, will you sharpen my
 57116	saber for me? Itâs got bl...â (PÃ©tya feared to tell a lie, and the saber
 57117	never had been sharpened.) âCan you do it?â
 57118	
 57119	âOf course I can.â
 57120	
 57121	LikhachÃ«v got up, rummaged in his pack, and soon PÃ©tya heard the warlike
 57122	sound of steel on whetstone. He climbed onto the wagon and sat on its
 57123	edge. The Cossack was sharpening the saber under the wagon.
 57124	
 57125	âI say! Are the lads asleep?â asked PÃ©tya.
 57126	
 57127	âSome are, and some arenâtâlike us.â
 57128	
 57129	âWell, and that boy?â
 57130	
 57131	âVesÃ©nny? Oh, heâs thrown himself down there in the passage. Fast asleep
 57132	after his fright. He was that glad!â
 57133	
 57134	After that PÃ©tya remained silent for a long time, listening to the
 57135	sounds. He heard footsteps in the darkness and a black figure appeared.
 57136	
 57137	âWhat are you sharpening?â asked a man coming up to the wagon.
 57138	
 57139	âWhy, this gentlemanâs saber.â
 57140	
 57141	âThatâs right,â said the man, whom PÃ©tya took to be an hussar. âWas the
 57142	cup left here?â
 57143	
 57144	âThere, by the wheel!â
 57145	
 57146	The hussar took the cup.
 57147	
 57148	âIt must be daylight soon,â said he, yawning, and went away.
 57149	
 57150	PÃ©tya ought to have known that he was in a forest with DenÃ­sovâs
 57151	guerrilla band, less than a mile from the road, sitting on a wagon
 57152	captured from the French beside which horses were tethered, that under
 57153	it LikhachÃ«v was sitting sharpening a saber for him, that the big dark
 57154	blotch to the right was the watchmanâs hut, and the red blotch below to
 57155	the left was the dying embers of a campfire, that the man who had come
 57156	for the cup was an hussar who wanted a drink; but he neither knew nor
 57157	waited to know anything of all this. He was in a fairy kingdom where
 57158	nothing resembled reality. The big dark blotch might really be the
 57159	watchmanâs hut or it might be a cavern leading to the very depths of
 57160	the earth. Perhaps the red spot was a fire, or it might be the eye of an
 57161	enormous monster. Perhaps he was really sitting on a wagon, but it might
 57162	very well be that he was not sitting on a wagon but on a terribly high
 57163	tower from which, if he fell, he would have to fall for a whole day or a
 57164	whole month, or go on falling and never reach the bottom. Perhaps it
 57165	was just the Cossack, LikhachÃ«v, who was sitting under the wagon, but it
 57166	might be the kindest, bravest, most wonderful, most splendid man in the
 57167	world, whom no one knew of. It might really have been that the hussar
 57168	came for water and went back into the hollow, but perhaps he had simply
 57169	vanishedâdisappeared altogether and dissolved into nothingness.
 57170	
 57171	Nothing PÃ©tya could have seen now would have surprised him. He was in a
 57172	fairy kingdom where everything was possible.
 57173	
 57174	He looked up at the sky. And the sky was a fairy realm like the earth.
 57175	It was clearing, and over the tops of the trees clouds were swiftly
 57176	sailing as if unveiling the stars. Sometimes it looked as if the clouds
 57177	were passing, and a clear black sky appeared. Sometimes it seemed as
 57178	if the black spaces were clouds. Sometimes the sky seemed to be rising
 57179	high, high overhead, and then it seemed to sink so low that one could
 57180	touch it with oneâs hand.
 57181	
 57182	PÃ©tyaâs eyes began to close and he swayed a little.
 57183	
 57184	The trees were dripping. Quiet talking was heard. The horses neighed and
 57185	jostled one another. Someone snored.
 57186	
 57187	âOzheg-zheg, Ozheg-zheg...â hissed the saber against the whetstone,
 57188	and suddenly PÃ©tya heard an harmonious orchestra playing some unknown,
 57189	sweetly solemn hymn. PÃ©tya was as musical as NatÃ¡sha and more so than
 57190	Nicholas, but had never learned music or thought about it, and so the
 57191	melody that unexpectedly came to his mind seemed to him particularly
 57192	fresh and attractive. The music became more and more audible. The melody
 57193	grew and passed from one instrument to another. And what was played was
 57194	a fugueâthough PÃ©tya had not the least conception of what a fugue is.
 57195	Each instrumentânow resembling a violin and now a horn, but better
 57196	and clearer than violin or hornâplayed its own part, and before it had
 57197	finished the melody merged with another instrument that began almost the
 57198	same air, and then with a third and a fourth; and they all blended into
 57199	one and again became separate and again blended, now into solemn church
 57200	music, now into something dazzlingly brilliant and triumphant.
 57201	
 57202	âOhâwhy, that was in a dream!â PÃ©tya said to himself, as he lurched
 57203	forward. âItâs in my ears. But perhaps itâs music of my own. Well, go
 57204	on, my music! Now!...â
 57205	
 57206	He closed his eyes, and, from all sides as if from a distance, sounds
 57207	fluttered, grew into harmonies, separated, blended, and again all
 57208	mingled into the same sweet and solemn hymn. âOh, this is delightful!
 57209	As much as I like and as I like!â said PÃ©tya to himself. He tried to
 57210	conduct that enormous orchestra.
 57211	
 57212	âNow softly, softly die away!â and the sounds obeyed him. âNow fuller,
 57213	more joyful. Still more and more joyful!â And from an unknown depth rose
 57214	increasingly triumphant sounds. âNow voices join in!â ordered PÃ©tya. And
 57215	at first from afar he heard menâs voices and then womenâs. The voices
 57216	grew in harmonious triumphant strength, and PÃ©tya listened to their
 57217	surpassing beauty in awe and joy.
 57218	
 57219	With a solemn triumphal march there mingled a song, the drip from the
 57220	trees, and the hissing of the saber, âOzheg-zheg-zheg...â and again the
 57221	horses jostled one another and neighed, not disturbing the choir but
 57222	joining in it.
 57223	
 57224	PÃ©tya did not know how long this lasted: he enjoyed himself all the
 57225	time, wondered at his enjoyment and regretted that there was no one to
 57226	share it. He was awakened by LikhachÃ«vâs kindly voice.
 57227	
 57228	âItâs ready, your honor; you can split a Frenchman in half with it!â
 57229	
 57230	PÃ©tya woke up.
 57231	
 57232	âItâs getting light, itâs really getting light!â he exclaimed.
 57233	
 57234	The horses that had previously been invisible could now be seen to their
 57235	very tails, and a watery light showed itself through the bare branches.
 57236	PÃ©tya shook himself, jumped up, took a ruble from his pocket and gave it
 57237	to LikhachÃ«v; then he flourished the saber, tested it, and sheathed
 57238	it. The Cossacks were untying their horses and tightening their saddle
 57239	girths.
 57240	
 57241	âAnd hereâs the commander,â said LikhachÃ«v.
 57242	
 57243	DenÃ­sov came out of the watchmanâs hut and, having called PÃ©tya, gave
 57244	orders to get ready.
 57245	
 57246	
 57247	
 57248	
 57249	
 57250	CHAPTER XI
 57251	
 57252	The men rapidly picked out their horses in the semidarkness, tightened
 57253	their saddle girths, and formed companies. DenÃ­sov stood by the
 57254	watchmanâs hut giving final orders. The infantry of the detachment
 57255	passed along the road and quickly disappeared amid the trees in the mist
 57256	of early dawn, hundreds of feet splashing through the mud. The esaul
 57257	gave some orders to his men. PÃ©tya held his horse by the bridle,
 57258	impatiently awaiting the order to mount. His face, having been bathed
 57259	in cold water, was all aglow, and his eyes were particularly brilliant.
 57260	Cold shivers ran down his spine and his whole body pulsed rhythmically.
 57261	
 57262	âWell, is evâwything weady?â asked DenÃ­sov. âBwing the horses.â
 57263	
 57264	The horses were brought. DenÃ­sov was angry with the Cossack because the
 57265	saddle girths were too slack, reproved him, and mounted. PÃ©tya put his
 57266	foot in the stirrup. His horse by habit made as if to nip his leg, but
 57267	PÃ©tya leaped quickly into the saddle unconscious of his own weight and,
 57268	turning to look at the hussars starting in the darkness behind him, rode
 57269	up to DenÃ­sov.
 57270	
 57271	âVasÃ­li DmÃ­trich, entrust me with some commission! Please... for Godâs
 57272	sake...!â said he.
 57273	
 57274	DenÃ­sov seemed to have forgotten PÃ©tyaâs very existence. He turned to
 57275	glance at him.
 57276	
 57277	âI ask one thing of you,â he said sternly, âto obey me and not shove
 57278	yourself forward anywhere.â
 57279	
 57280	He did not say another word to PÃ©tya but rode in silence all the way.
 57281	When they had come to the edge of the forest it was noticeably growing
 57282	light over the field. DenÃ­sov talked in whispers with the esaul and
 57283	the Cossacks rode past PÃ©tya and DenÃ­sov. When they had all ridden by,
 57284	DenÃ­sov touched his horse and rode down the hill. Slipping onto their
 57285	haunches and sliding, the horses descended with their riders into the
 57286	ravine. PÃ©tya rode beside DenÃ­sov, the pulsation of his body constantly
 57287	increasing. It was getting lighter and lighter, but the mist still hid
 57288	distant objects. Having reached the valley, DenÃ­sov looked back and
 57289	nodded to a Cossack beside him.
 57290	
 57291	âThe signal!â said he.
 57292	
 57293	The Cossack raised his arm and a shot rang out. In an instant the tramp
 57294	of horses galloping forward was heard, shouts came from various sides,
 57295	and then more shots.
 57296	
 57297	At the first sound of trampling hoofs and shouting, PÃ©tya lashed his
 57298	horse and loosening his rein galloped forward, not heeding DenÃ­sov who
 57299	shouted at him. It seemed to PÃ©tya that at the moment the shot was
 57300	fired it suddenly became as bright as noon. He galloped to the bridge.
 57301	Cossacks were galloping along the road in front of him. On the bridge
 57302	he collided with a Cossack who had fallen behind, but he galloped on.
 57303	In front of him soldiers, probably Frenchmen, were running from right
 57304	to left across the road. One of them fell in the mud under his horseâs
 57305	feet.
 57306	
 57307	Cossacks were crowding about a hut, busy with something. From the midst
 57308	of that crowd terrible screams arose. PÃ©tya galloped up, and the
 57309	first thing he saw was the pale face and trembling jaw of a Frenchman,
 57310	clutching the handle of a lance that had been aimed at him.
 57311	
 57312	âHurrah!... Lads!... ours!â shouted PÃ©tya, and giving rein to his
 57313	excited horse he galloped forward along the village street.
 57314	
 57315	He could hear shooting ahead of him. Cossacks, hussars, and ragged
 57316	Russian prisoners, who had come running from both sides of the road,
 57317	were shouting something loudly and incoherently. A gallant-looking
 57318	Frenchman, in a blue overcoat, capless, and with a frowning red face,
 57319	had been defending himself against the hussars. When PÃ©tya galloped
 57320	up the Frenchman had already fallen. âToo late again!â flashed through
 57321	PÃ©tyaâs mind and he galloped on to the place from which the rapid firing
 57322	could be heard. The shots came from the yard of the landownerâs house
 57323	he had visited the night before with DÃ³lokhov. The French were making
 57324	a stand there behind a wattle fence in a garden thickly overgrown with
 57325	bushes and were firing at the Cossacks who crowded at the gateway.
 57326	Through the smoke, as he approached the gate, PÃ©tya saw DÃ³lokhov, whose
 57327	face was of a pale-greenish tint, shouting to his men. âGo round! Wait
 57328	for the infantry!â he exclaimed as PÃ©tya rode up to him.
 57329	
 57330	âWait?... Hurrah-ah-ah!â shouted PÃ©tya, and without pausing a moment
 57331	galloped to the place whence came the sounds of firing and where the
 57332	smoke was thickest.
 57333	
 57334	A volley was heard, and some bullets whistled past, while others plashed
 57335	against something. The Cossacks and DÃ³lokhov galloped after PÃ©tya into
 57336	the gateway of the courtyard. In the dense wavering smoke some of the
 57337	French threw down their arms and ran out of the bushes to meet the
 57338	Cossacks, while others ran down the hill toward the pond. PÃ©tya was
 57339	galloping along the courtyard, but instead of holding the reins he waved
 57340	both his arms about rapidly and strangely, slipping farther and farther
 57341	to one side in his saddle. His horse, having galloped up to a campfire
 57342	that was smoldering in the morning light, stopped suddenly, and PÃ©tya
 57343	fell heavily on to the wet ground. The Cossacks saw that his arms and
 57344	legs jerked rapidly though his head was quite motionless. A bullet had
 57345	pierced his skull.
 57346	
 57347	After speaking to the senior French officer, who came out of the house
 57348	with a white handkerchief tied to his sword and announced that
 57349	they surrendered, DÃ³lokhov dismounted and went up to PÃ©tya, who lay
 57350	motionless with outstretched arms.
 57351	
 57352	âDone for!â he said with a frown, and went to the gate to meet DenÃ­sov
 57353	who was riding toward him.
 57354	
 57355	âKilled?â cried DenÃ­sov, recognizing from a distance the unmistakably
 57356	lifeless attitudeâvery familiar to himâin which PÃ©tyaâs body was lying.
 57357	
 57358	âDone for!â repeated DÃ³lokhov as if the utterance of these words
 57359	afforded him pleasure, and he went quickly up to the prisoners, who
 57360	were surrounded by Cossacks who had hurried up. âWe wonât take them!â he
 57361	called out to DenÃ­sov.
 57362	
 57363	DenÃ­sov did not reply; he rode up to PÃ©tya, dismounted, and with
 57364	trembling hands turned toward himself the bloodstained, mud-bespattered
 57365	face which had already gone white.
 57366	
 57367	âI am used to something sweet. Raisins, fine ones... take them all!â he
 57368	recalled PÃ©tyaâs words. And the Cossacks looked round in surprise at the
 57369	sound, like the yelp of a dog, with which DenÃ­sov turned away, walked to
 57370	the wattle fence, and seized hold of it.
 57371	
 57372	Among the Russian prisoners rescued by DenÃ­sov and DÃ³lokhov was Pierre
 57373	BezÃºkhov.
 57374

 57378	
 57379	CHAPTER XII
 57380	
 57381	During the whole of their march from Moscow no fresh orders had been
 57382	issued by the French authorities concerning the party of prisoners
 57383	among whom was Pierre. On the twenty-second of October that party was
 57384	no longer with the same troops and baggage trains with which it had left
 57385	Moscow. Half the wagons laden with hardtack that had traveled the first
 57386	stages with them had been captured by Cossacks, the other half had gone
 57387	on ahead. Not one of those dismounted cavalrymen who had marched in
 57388	front of the prisoners was left; they had all disappeared. The artillery
 57389	the prisoners had seen in front of them during the first days was
 57390	now replaced by Marshal Junotâs enormous baggage train, convoyed by
 57391	Westphalians. Behind the prisoners came a cavalry baggage train.
 57392	
 57393	From VyÃ¡zma onwards the French army, which had till then moved in three
 57394	columns, went on as a single group. The symptoms of disorder that Pierre
 57395	had noticed at their first halting place after leaving Moscow had now
 57396	reached the utmost limit.
 57397	
 57398	The road along which they moved was bordered on both sides by dead
 57399	horses; ragged men who had fallen behind from various regiments
 57400	continually changed about, now joining the moving column, now again
 57401	lagging behind it.
 57402	
 57403	Several times during the march false alarms had been given and the
 57404	soldiers of the escort had raised their muskets, fired, and run
 57405	headlong, crushing one another, but had afterwards reassembled and
 57406	abused each other for their causeless panic.
 57407	
 57408	These three groups traveling togetherâthe cavalry stores, the convoy of
 57409	prisoners, and Junotâs baggage trainâstill constituted a separate and
 57410	united whole, though each of the groups was rapidly melting away.
 57411	
 57412	Of the artillery baggage train which had consisted of a hundred and
 57413	twenty wagons, not more than sixty now remained; the rest had been
 57414	captured or left behind. Some of Junotâs wagons also had been captured
 57415	or abandoned. Three wagons had been raided and robbed by stragglers
 57416	from Davoutâs corps. From the talk of the Germans Pierre learned that
 57417	a larger guard had been allotted to that baggage train than to the
 57418	prisoners, and that one of their comrades, a German soldier, had been
 57419	shot by the marshalâs own order because a silver spoon belonging to the
 57420	marshal had been found in his possession.
 57421	
 57422	The group of prisoners had melted away most of all. Of the three hundred
 57423	and thirty men who had set out from Moscow fewer than a hundred now
 57424	remained. The prisoners were more burdensome to the escort than even the
 57425	cavalry saddles or Junotâs baggage. They understood that the saddles and
 57426	Junotâs spoon might be of some use, but that cold and hungry soldiers
 57427	should have to stand and guard equally cold and hungry Russians who
 57428	froze and lagged behind on the road (in which case the order was to
 57429	shoot them) was not merely incomprehensible but revolting. And the
 57430	escort, as if afraid, in the grievous condition they themselves were in,
 57431	of giving way to the pity they felt for the prisoners and so rendering
 57432	their own plight still worse, treated them with particular moroseness
 57433	and severity.
 57434	
 57435	At DorogobÃºzh while the soldiers of the convoy, after locking the
 57436	prisoners in a stable, had gone off to pillage their own stores, several
 57437	of the soldier prisoners tunneled under the wall and ran away, but were
 57438	recaptured by the French and shot.
 57439	
 57440	The arrangement adopted when they started, that the officer prisoners
 57441	should be kept separate from the rest, had long since been abandoned.
 57442	All who could walk went together, and after the third stage Pierre had
 57443	rejoined KaratÃ¡ev and the gray-blue bandy-legged dog that had chosen
 57444	KaratÃ¡ev for its master.
 57445	
 57446	On the third day after leaving Moscow KaratÃ¡ev again fell ill with the
 57447	fever he had suffered from in the hospital in Moscow, and as he grew
 57448	gradually weaker Pierre kept away from him. Pierre did not know why, but
 57449	since KaratÃ¡ev had begun to grow weaker it had cost him an effort to
 57450	go near him. When he did so and heard the subdued moaning with which
 57451	KaratÃ¡ev generally lay down at the halting places, and when he smelled
 57452	the odor emanating from him which was now stronger than before, Pierre
 57453	moved farther away and did not think about him.
 57454	
 57455	While imprisoned in the shed Pierre had learned not with his intellect
 57456	but with his whole being, by life itself, that man is created for
 57457	happiness, that happiness is within him, in the satisfaction of simple
 57458	human needs, and that all unhappiness arises not from privation but from
 57459	superfluity. And now during these last three weeks of the march he had
 57460	learned still another new, consolatory truthâthat nothing in this world
 57461	is terrible. He had learned that as there is no condition in which man
 57462	can be happy and entirely free, so there is no condition in which he
 57463	need be unhappy and lack freedom. He learned that suffering and freedom
 57464	have their limits and that those limits are very near together; that the
 57465	person in a bed of roses with one crumpled petal suffered as keenly as
 57466	he now, sleeping on the bare damp earth with one side growing chilled
 57467	while the other was warming; and that when he had put on tight dancing
 57468	shoes he had suffered just as he did now when he walked with bare feet
 57469	that were covered with soresâhis footgear having long since fallen to
 57470	pieces. He discovered that when he had married his wifeâof his own free
 57471	will as it had seemed to himâhe had been no more free than now when they
 57472	locked him up at night in a stable. Of all that he himself subsequently
 57473	termed his sufferings, but which at the time he scarcely felt, the worst
 57474	was the state of his bare, raw, and scab-covered feet. (The horseflesh
 57475	was appetizing and nourishing, the saltpeter flavor of the gunpowder
 57476	they used instead of salt was even pleasant; there was no great cold,
 57477	it was always warm walking in the daytime, and at night there were the
 57478	campfires; the lice that devoured him warmed his body.) The one thing
 57479	that was at first hard to bear was his feet.
 57480	
 57481	After the second dayâs march Pierre, having examined his feet by the
 57482	campfire, thought it would be impossible to walk on them; but when
 57483	everybody got up he went along, limping, and, when he had warmed up,
 57484	walked without feeling the pain, though at night his feet were more
 57485	terrible to look at than before. However, he did not look at them now,
 57486	but thought of other things.
 57487	
 57488	Only now did Pierre realize the full strength of life in man and the
 57489	saving power he has of transferring his attention from one thing
 57490	to another, which is like the safety valve of a boiler that allows
 57491	superfluous steam to blow off when the pressure exceeds a certain limit.
 57492	
 57493	He did not see and did not hear how they shot the prisoners who lagged
 57494	behind, though more than a hundred perished in that way. He did not
 57495	think of KaratÃ¡ev who grew weaker every day and evidently would soon
 57496	have to share that fate. Still less did Pierre think about himself. The
 57497	harder his position became and the more terrible the future, the more
 57498	independent of that position in which he found himself were the joyful
 57499	and comforting thoughts, memories, and imaginings that came to him.
 57500	
 57501	
 57502	
 57503	
 57504	
 57505	CHAPTER XIII
 57506	
 57507	At midday on the twenty-second of October Pierre was going uphill along
 57508	the muddy, slippery road, looking at his feet and at the roughness of
 57509	the way. Occasionally he glanced at the familiar crowd around him and
 57510	then again at his feet. The former and the latter were alike familiar
 57511	and his own. The blue-gray bandy legged dog ran merrily along the side
 57512	of the road, sometimes in proof of its agility and self-satisfaction
 57513	lifting one hind leg and hopping along on three, and then again going on
 57514	all four and rushing to bark at the crows that sat on the carrion. The
 57515	dog was merrier and sleeker than it had been in Moscow. All around lay
 57516	the flesh of different animalsâfrom men to horsesâin various stages of
 57517	decomposition; and as the wolves were kept off by the passing men the
 57518	dog could eat all it wanted.
 57519	
 57520	It had been raining since morning and had seemed as if at any moment it
 57521	might cease and the sky clear, but after a short break it began raining
 57522	harder than before. The saturated road no longer absorbed the water,
 57523	which ran along the ruts in streams.
 57524	
 57525	Pierre walked along, looking from side to side, counting his steps in
 57526	threes, and reckoning them off on his fingers. Mentally addressing the
 57527	rain, he repeated: âNow then, now then, go on! Pelt harder!â
 57528	
 57529	It seemed to him that he was thinking of nothing, but far down and
 57530	deep within him his soul was occupied with something important and
 57531	comforting. This something was a most subtle spiritual deduction from a
 57532	conversation with KaratÃ¡ev the day before.
 57533	
 57534	At their yesterdayâs halting place, feeling chilly by a dying campfire,
 57535	Pierre had got up and gone to the next one, which was burning better.
 57536	There PlatÃ³n KaratÃ¡ev was sitting covered upâhead and allâwith his
 57537	greatcoat as if it were a vestment, telling the soldiers in his
 57538	effective and pleasant though now feeble voice a story Pierre knew. It
 57539	was already past midnight, the hour when KaratÃ¡ev was usually free of
 57540	his fever and particularly lively. When Pierre reached the fire and
 57541	heard PlatÃ³nâs voice enfeebled by illness, and saw his pathetic face
 57542	brightly lit up by the blaze, he felt a painful prick at his heart. His
 57543	feeling of pity for this man frightened him and he wished to go away,
 57544	but there was no other fire, and Pierre sat down, trying not to look at
 57545	PlatÃ³n.
 57546	
 57547	âWell, how are you?â he asked.
 57548	
 57549	âHow am I? If we grumble at sickness, God wonât grant us death,â replied
 57550	PlatÃ³n, and at once resumed the story he had begun.
 57551	
 57552	âAnd so, brother,â he continued, with a smile on his pale emaciated face
 57553	and a particularly happy light in his eyes, âyou see, brother...â
 57554	
 57555	Pierre had long been familiar with that story. KaratÃ¡ev had told it
 57556	to him alone some half-dozen times and always with a specially joyful
 57557	emotion. But well as he knew it, Pierre now listened to that tale as to
 57558	something new, and the quiet rapture KaratÃ¡ev evidently felt as he told
 57559	it communicated itself also to Pierre. The story was of an old merchant
 57560	who lived a good and God-fearing life with his family, and who went once
 57561	to the NÃ­zhni fair with a companionâa rich merchant.
 57562	
 57563	Having put up at an inn they both went to sleep, and next morning his
 57564	companion was found robbed and with his throat cut. A bloodstained knife
 57565	was found under the old merchantâs pillow. He was tried, knouted, and
 57566	his nostrils having been torn off, âall in due formâ as KaratÃ¡ev put it,
 57567	he was sent to hard labor in Siberia.
 57568	
 57569	âAnd so, brotherâ (it was at this point that Pierre came up), âten years
 57570	or more passed by. The old man was living as a convict, submitting as
 57571	he should and doing no wrong. Only he prayed to God for death. Well, one
 57572	night the convicts were gathered just as we are, with the old man among
 57573	them. And they began telling what each was suffering for, and how they
 57574	had sinned against God. One told how he had taken a life, another had
 57575	taken two, a third had set a house on fire, while another had simply
 57576	been a vagrant and had done nothing. So they asked the old man: âWhat
 57577	are you being punished for, Daddy?âââI, my dear brothers,â said he, âam
 57578	being punished for my own and other menâs sins. But I have not killed
 57579	anyone or taken anything that was not mine, but have only helped my
 57580	poorer brothers. I was a merchant, my dear brothers, and had much
 57581	property. âAnd he went on to tell them all about it in due order. âI
 57582	donât grieve for myself,â he says, âGod, it seems, has chastened me.
 57583	Only I am sorry for my old wife and the children,â and the old man began
 57584	to weep. Now it happened that in the group was the very man who had
 57585	killed the other merchant. âWhere did it happen, Daddy?â he said. âWhen,
 57586	and in what month?â He asked all about it and his heart began to ache.
 57587	So he comes up to the old man like this, and falls down at his feet!
 57588	âYou are perishing because of me, Daddy,â he says. âItâs quite true,
 57589	lads, that this man,â he says, âis being tortured innocently and for
 57590	nothing! I,â he says, âdid that deed, and I put the knife under your
 57591	head while you were asleep. Forgive me, Daddy,â he says, âfor Christâs
 57592	sake!ââ
 57593	
 57594	KaratÃ¡ev paused, smiling joyously as he gazed into the fire, and he drew
 57595	the logs together.
 57596	
 57597	âAnd the old man said, âGod will forgive you, we are all sinners in His
 57598	sight. I suffer for my own sins,â and he wept bitter tears. Well,
 57599	and what do you think, dear friends?â KaratÃ¡ev continued, his face
 57600	brightening more and more with a rapturous smile as if what he now had
 57601	to tell contained the chief charm and the whole meaning of his story:
 57602	âWhat do you think, dear fellows? That murderer confessed to the
 57603	authorities. âI have taken six lives,â he says (he was a great sinner),
 57604	âbut what I am most sorry for is this old man. Donât let him suffer
 57605	because of me.â So he confessed and it was all written down and the
 57606	papers sent off in due form. The place was a long way off, and while
 57607	they were judging, what with one thing and another, filling in the
 57608	papers all in due formâthe authorities I meanâtime passed. The affair
 57609	reached the Tsar. After a while the Tsarâs decree came: to set the
 57610	merchant free and give him a compensation that had been awarded. The
 57611	paper arrived and they began to look for the old man. âWhere is the old
 57612	man who has been suffering innocently and in vain? A paper has come from
 57613	the Tsar!â so they began looking for him,â here KaratÃ¡evâs lower jaw
 57614	trembled, âbut God had already forgiven himâhe was dead! Thatâs how it
 57615	was, dear fellows!â KaratÃ¡ev concluded and sat for a long time silent,
 57616	gazing before him with a smile.
 57617	
 57618	And Pierreâs soul was dimly but joyfully filled not by the story itself
 57619	but by its mysterious significance: by the rapturous joy that lit up
 57620	KaratÃ¡evâs face as he told it, and the mystic significance of that joy.
 57621

 57626	CHAPTER XIV
 57627	
 57628	âÃ vos places!â * suddenly cried a voice.
 57629	
 57630	    * âTo your places.â
 57631	
 57632	
 57633	A pleasant feeling of excitement and an expectation of something
 57634	joyful and solemn was aroused among the soldiers of the convoy and the
 57635	prisoners. From all sides came shouts of command, and from the left came
 57636	smartly dressed cavalrymen on good horses, passing the prisoners at a
 57637	trot. The expression on all faces showed the tension people feel at the
 57638	approach of those in authority. The prisoners thronged together and were
 57639	pushed off the road. The convoy formed up.
 57640	
 57641	âThe Emperor! The Emperor! The Marshal! The Duke!â and hardly had the
 57642	sleek cavalry passed, before a carriage drawn by six gray horses rattled
 57643	by. Pierre caught a glimpse of a man in a three-cornered hat with a
 57644	tranquil look on his handsome, plump, white face. It was one of the
 57645	marshals. His eye fell on Pierreâs large and striking figure, and in
 57646	the expression with which he frowned and looked away Pierre thought he
 57647	detected sympathy and a desire to conceal that sympathy.
 57648	
 57649	The general in charge of the stores galloped after the carriage with a
 57650	red and frightened face, whipping up his skinny horse. Several officers
 57651	formed a group and some soldiers crowded round them. Their faces all
 57652	looked excited and worried.
 57653	
 57654	âWhat did he say? What did he say?â Pierre heard them ask.
 57655	
 57656	While the marshal was passing, the prisoners had huddled together in a
 57657	crowd, and Pierre saw KaratÃ¡ev whom he had not yet seen that morning.
 57658	He sat in his short overcoat leaning against a birch tree. On his face,
 57659	besides the look of joyful emotion it had worn yesterday while telling
 57660	the tale of the merchant who suffered innocently, there was now an
 57661	expression of quiet solemnity.
 57662	
 57663	KaratÃ¡ev looked at Pierre with his kindly round eyes now filled with
 57664	tears, evidently wishing him to come near that he might say something to
 57665	him. But Pierre was not sufficiently sure of himself. He made as if he
 57666	did not notice that look and moved hastily away.
 57667	
 57668	When the prisoners again went forward Pierre looked round. KaratÃ¡ev
 57669	was still sitting at the side of the road under the birch tree and two
 57670	Frenchmen were talking over his head. Pierre did not look round again
 57671	but went limping up the hill.
 57672	
 57673	From behind, where KaratÃ¡ev had been sitting, came the sound of a shot.
 57674	Pierre heard it plainly, but at that moment he remembered that he
 57675	had not yet finished reckoning up how many stages still remained to
 57676	SmolÃ©nskâa calculation he had begun before the marshal went by. And he
 57677	again started reckoning. Two French soldiers ran past Pierre, one of
 57678	whom carried a lowered and smoking gun. They both looked pale, and
 57679	in the expression on their facesâone of them glanced timidly at
 57680	Pierreâthere was something resembling what he had seen on the face of
 57681	the young soldier at the execution. Pierre looked at the soldier and
 57682	remembered that, two days before, that man had burned his shirt while
 57683	drying it at the fire and how they had laughed at him.
 57684	
 57685	Behind him, where KaratÃ¡ev had been sitting, the dog began to howl.
 57686	âWhat a stupid beast! Why is it howling?â thought Pierre.
 57687	
 57688	His comrades, the prisoner soldiers walking beside him, avoided looking
 57689	back at the place where the shot had been fired and the dog was howling,
 57690	just as Pierre did, but there was a set look on all their faces.
 57691	
 57692	
 57693	
 57694	
 57695	
 57696	CHAPTER XV
 57697	
 57698	The stores, the prisoners, and the marshalâs baggage train stopped at
 57699	the village of ShÃ¡mshevo. The men crowded together round the campfires.
 57700	Pierre went up to the fire, ate some roast horseflesh, lay down with his
 57701	back to the fire, and immediately fell asleep. He again slept as he had
 57702	done at MozhÃ¡ysk after the battle of BorodinÃ³.
 57703	
 57704	Again real events mingled with dreams and again someone, he or another,
 57705	gave expression to his thoughts, and even to the same thoughts that had
 57706	been expressed in his dream at MozhÃ¡ysk.
 57707	
 57708	âLife is everything. Life is God. Everything changes and moves and that
 57709	movement is God. And while there is life there is joy in consciousness
 57710	of the divine. To love life is to love God. Harder and more blessed
 57711	than all else is to love this life in oneâs sufferings, in innocent
 57712	sufferings.â
 57713	
 57714	âKaratÃ¡ev!â came to Pierreâs mind.
 57715	
 57716	And suddenly he saw vividly before him a long-forgotten, kindly old man
 57717	who had given him geography lessons in Switzerland. âWait a bit,â said
 57718	the old man, and showed Pierre a globe. This globe was aliveâa vibrating
 57719	ball without fixed dimensions. Its whole surface consisted of drops
 57720	closely pressed together, and all these drops moved and changed places,
 57721	sometimes several of them merging into one, sometimes one dividing
 57722	into many. Each drop tried to spread out and occupy as much space as
 57723	possible, but others striving to do the same compressed it, sometimes
 57724	destroyed it, and sometimes merged with it.
 57725	
 57726	âThat is life,â said the old teacher.
 57727	
 57728	âHow simple and clear it is,â thought Pierre. âHow is it I did not know
 57729	it before?â
 57730	
 57731	âGod is in the midst, and each drop tries to expand so as to reflect
 57732	Him to the greatest extent. And it grows, merges, disappears from the
 57733	surface, sinks to the depths, and again emerges. There now, KaratÃ¡ev
 57734	has spread out and disappeared. Do you understand, my child?â said the
 57735	teacher.
 57736	
 57737	âDo you understand, damn you?â shouted a voice, and Pierre woke up.
 57738	
 57739	He lifted himself and sat up. A Frenchman who had just pushed a Russian
 57740	soldier away was squatting by the fire, engaged in roasting a piece
 57741	of meat stuck on a ramrod. His sleeves were rolled up and his sinewy,
 57742	hairy, red hands with their short fingers deftly turned the ramrod. His
 57743	brown morose face with frowning brows was clearly visible by the glow of
 57744	the charcoal.
 57745	
 57746	âItâs all the same to him,â he muttered, turning quickly to a soldier
 57747	who stood behind him. âBrigand! Get away!â
 57748	
 57749	And twisting the ramrod he looked gloomily at Pierre, who turned
 57750	away and gazed into the darkness. A prisoner, the Russian soldier the
 57751	Frenchman had pushed away, was sitting near the fire patting something
 57752	with his hand. Looking more closely Pierre recognized the blue-gray dog,
 57753	sitting beside the soldier, wagging its tail.
 57754	
 57755	âAh, heâs come?â said Pierre. âAnd Platââ he began, but did not finish.
 57756	
 57757	Suddenly and simultaneously a crowd of memories awoke in his fancyâof
 57758	the look PlatÃ³n had given him as he sat under the tree, of the shot
 57759	heard from that spot, of the dogâs howl, of the guilty faces of the two
 57760	Frenchmen as they ran past him, of the lowered and smoking gun, and of
 57761	KaratÃ¡evâs absence at this haltâand he was on the point of realizing
 57762	that KaratÃ¡ev had been killed, but just at that instant, he knew not
 57763	why, the recollection came to his mind of a summer evening he had spent
 57764	with a beautiful Polish lady on the veranda of his house in Kiev. And
 57765	without linking up the events of the day or drawing a conclusion
 57766	from them, Pierre closed his eyes, seeing a vision of the country in
 57767	summertime mingled with memories of bathing and of the liquid, vibrating
 57768	globe, and he sank into water so that it closed over his head.
 57769	
 57770	Before sunrise he was awakened by shouts and loud and rapid firing.
 57771	French soldiers were running past him.
 57772	
 57773	âThe Cossacks!â one of them shouted, and a moment later a crowd of
 57774	Russians surrounded Pierre.
 57775	
 57776	For a long time he could not understand what was happening to him. All
 57777	around he heard his comrades sobbing with joy.
 57778	
 57779	âBrothers! Dear fellows! Darlings!â old soldiers exclaimed, weeping, as
 57780	they embraced Cossacks and hussars.
 57781	
 57782	The hussars and Cossacks crowded round the prisoners; one offered them
 57783	clothes, another boots, and a third bread. Pierre sobbed as he sat
 57784	among them and could not utter a word. He hugged the first soldier who
 57785	approached him, and kissed him, weeping.
 57786	
 57787	DÃ³lokhov stood at the gate of the ruined house, letting a crowd
 57788	of disarmed Frenchmen pass by. The French, excited by all that had
 57789	happened, were talking loudly among themselves, but as they passed
 57790	DÃ³lokhov who gently switched his boots with his whip and watched them
 57791	with cold glassy eyes that boded no good, they became silent. On the
 57792	opposite side stood DÃ³lokhovâs Cossack, counting the prisoners and
 57793	marking off each hundred with a chalk line on the gate.
 57794	
 57795	âHow many?â DÃ³lokhov asked the Cossack.
 57796	
 57797	âThe second hundred,â replied the Cossack.
 57798	
 57799	âFilez, filez!â * DÃ³lokhov kept saying, having adopted this expression
 57800	from the French, and when his eyes met those of the prisoners they
 57801	flashed with a cruel light.
 57802	
 57803	    * âGet along, get along!â
 57804	
 57805	
 57806	DenÃ­sov, bareheaded and with a gloomy face, walked behind some Cossacks
 57807	who were carrying the body of PÃ©tya RostÃ³v to a hole that had been dug
 57808	in the garden.
 57809	
 57810	
 57811	
 57812	
 57813	
 57814	CHAPTER XVI
 57815	
 57816	After the twenty-eighth of October when the frosts began, the flight of
 57817	the French assumed a still more tragic character, with men freezing,
 57818	or roasting themselves to death at the campfires, while carriages
 57819	with people dressed in furs continued to drive past, carrying away the
 57820	property that had been stolen by the Emperor, kings, and dukes; but
 57821	the process of the flight and disintegration of the French army went on
 57822	essentially as before.
 57823	
 57824	From Moscow to VyÃ¡zma the French army of seventy-three thousand men not
 57825	reckoning the Guards (who did nothing during the whole war but pillage)
 57826	was reduced to thirty-six thousand, though not more than five thousand
 57827	had fallen in battle. From this beginning the succeeding terms of the
 57828	progression could be determined mathematically. The French army melted
 57829	away and perished at the same rate from Moscow to VyÃ¡zma, from VyÃ¡zma
 57830	to SmolÃ©nsk, from SmolÃ©nsk to the BerÃ«zina, and from the BerÃ«zina to
 57831	VÃ­lnaâindependently of the greater or lesser intensity of the cold, the
 57832	pursuit, the barring of the way, or any other particular conditions.
 57833	Beyond VyÃ¡zma the French army instead of moving in three columns huddled
 57834	together into one mass, and so went on to the end. Berthier wrote to his
 57835	Emperor (we know how far commanding officers allow themselves to diverge
 57836	from the truth in describing the condition of an army) and this is what
 57837	he said:
 57838	
 57839	
 57840	I deem it my duty to report to Your Majesty the condition of the various
 57841	corps I have had occasion to observe during different stages of the last
 57842	two or three daysâ march. They are almost disbanded. Scarcely a quarter
 57843	of the soldiers remain with the standards of their regiments, the others
 57844	go off by themselves in different directions hoping to find food and
 57845	escape discipline. In general they regard SmolÃ©nsk as the place where
 57846	they hope to recover. During the last few days many of the men have been
 57847	seen to throw away their cartridges and their arms. In such a state
 57848	of affairs, whatever your ultimate plans may be, the interest of Your
 57849	Majestyâs service demands that the army should be rallied at SmolÃ©nsk
 57850	and should first of all be freed from ineffectives, such as dismounted
 57851	cavalry, unnecessary baggage, and artillery material that is no longer
 57852	in proportion to the present forces. The soldiers, who are worn out with
 57853	hunger and fatigue, need these supplies as well as a few daysâ rest.
 57854	Many have died these last days on the road or at the bivouacs. This
 57855	state of things is continually becoming worse and makes one fear that
 57856	unless a prompt remedy is applied the troops will no longer be under
 57857	control in case of an engagement.
 57858	
 57859	November 9: twenty miles from SmolÃ©nsk.
 57860	
 57861	
 57862	After staggering into SmolÃ©nsk which seemed to them a promised land, the
 57863	French, searching for food, killed one another, sacked their own stores,
 57864	and when everything had been plundered fled farther.
 57865	
 57866	They all went without knowing whither or why they were going. Still less
 57867	did that genius, Napoleon, know it, for no one issued any orders to
 57868	him. But still he and those about him retained their old habits: wrote
 57869	commands, letters, reports, and orders of the day; called one another
 57870	sire, mon cousin, prince dâEckmÃ¼hl, roi de Naples, and so on. But these
 57871	orders and reports were only on paper, nothing in them was acted upon
 57872	for they could not be carried out, and though they entitled one
 57873	another Majesties, Highnesses, or Cousins, they all felt that they were
 57874	miserable wretches who had done much evil for which they had now to
 57875	pay. And though they pretended to be concerned about the army, each
 57876	was thinking only of himself and of how to get away quickly and save
 57877	himself.
 57878	
 57879	
 57880	
 57881	
 57882	
 57883	CHAPTER XVII
 57884	
 57885	The movements of the Russian and French armies during the campaign
 57886	from Moscow back to the Niemen were like those in a game of Russian
 57887	blindmanâs buff, in which two players are blindfolded and one of
 57888	them occasionally rings a little bell to inform the catcher of his
 57889	whereabouts. First he rings his bell fearlessly, but when he gets into
 57890	a tight place he runs away as quietly as he can, and often thinking to
 57891	escape runs straight into his opponentâs arms.
 57892	
 57893	At first while they were still moving along the KalÃºga road, Napoleonâs
 57894	armies made their presence known, but later when they reached the
 57895	SmolÃ©nsk road they ran holding the clapper of their bell tightâand often
 57896	thinking they were escaping ran right into the Russians.
 57897	
 57898	Owing to the rapidity of the French flight and the Russian pursuit
 57899	and the consequent exhaustion of the horses, the chief means of
 57900	approximately ascertaining the enemyâs positionâby cavalry scoutingâwas
 57901	not available. Besides, as a result of the frequent and rapid change of
 57902	position by each army, even what information was obtained could not be
 57903	delivered in time. If news was received one day that the enemy had been
 57904	in a certain position the day before, by the third day when something
 57905	could have been done, that army was already two daysâ march farther on
 57906	and in quite another position.
 57907	
 57908	One army fled and the other pursued. Beyond SmolÃ©nsk there were several
 57909	different roads available for the French, and one would have thought
 57910	that during their stay of four days they might have learned where
 57911	the enemy was, might have arranged some more advantageous plan and
 57912	undertaken something new. But after a four daysâ halt the mob, with no
 57913	maneuvers or plans, again began running along the beaten track, neither
 57914	to the right nor to the left but along the oldâthe worstâroad, through
 57915	KrÃ¡snoe and OrshÃ¡.
 57916	
 57917	Expecting the enemy from behind and not in front, the French separated
 57918	in their flight and spread out over a distance of twenty-four hours. In
 57919	front of them all fled the Emperor, then the kings, then the dukes. The
 57920	Russian army, expecting Napoleon to take the road to the right beyond
 57921	the Dnieperâwhich was the only reasonable thing for him to doâthemselves
 57922	turned to the right and came out onto the highroad at KrÃ¡snoe. And here
 57923	as in a game of blindmanâs buff the French ran into our vanguard. Seeing
 57924	their enemy unexpectedly the French fell into confusion and stopped
 57925	short from the sudden fright, but then they resumed their flight,
 57926	abandoning their comrades who were farther behind. Then for three days
 57927	separate portions of the French armyâfirst Muratâs (the vice-kingâs),
 57928	then Davoutâs, and then Neyâsâran, as it were, the gauntlet of the
 57929	Russian army. They abandoned one another, abandoned all their heavy
 57930	baggage, their artillery, and half their men, and fled, getting past the
 57931	Russians by night by making semicircles to the right.
 57932	
 57933	Ney, who came last, had been busying himself blowing up the walls of
 57934	SmolÃ©nsk which were in nobodyâs way, because despite the unfortunate
 57935	plight of the French or because of it, they wished to punish the floor
 57936	against which they had hurt themselves. Ney, who had had a corps of ten
 57937	thousand men, reached Napoleon at OrshÃ¡ with only one thousand men left,
 57938	having abandoned all the rest and all his cannon, and having crossed the
 57939	Dnieper at night by stealth at a wooded spot.
 57940	
 57941	From OrshÃ¡ they fled farther along the road to VÃ­lna, still playing
 57942	at blindmanâs buff with the pursuing army. At the BerÃ«zina they again
 57943	became disorganized, many were drowned and many surrendered, but those
 57944	who got across the river fled farther. Their supreme chief donned a
 57945	fur coat and, having seated himself in a sleigh, galloped on alone,
 57946	abandoning his companions. The others who could do so drove away too,
 57947	leaving those who could not to surrender or die.
 57948	
 57949	
 57950	
 57951	
 57952	
 57953	CHAPTER XVIII
 57954	
 57955	This campaign consisted in a flight of the French during which they did
 57956	all they could to destroy themselves. From the time they turned onto
 57957	the KalÃºga road to the day their leader fled from the army, none of the
 57958	movements of the crowd had any sense. So one might have thought that
 57959	regarding this period of the campaign the historians, who attributed
 57960	the actions of the mass to the will of one man, would have found it
 57961	impossible to make the story of the retreat fit their theory. But
 57962	no! Mountains of books have been written by the historians about this
 57963	campaign, and everywhere are described Napoleonâs arrangements, the
 57964	maneuvers, and his profound plans which guided the army, as well as the
 57965	military genius shown by his marshals.
 57966	
 57967	The retreat from MÃ¡lo-YaroslÃ¡vets when he had a free road into a
 57968	well-supplied district and the parallel road was open to him along
 57969	which KutÃºzov afterwards pursued himâthis unnecessary retreat along
 57970	a devastated roadâis explained to us as being due to profound
 57971	considerations. Similarly profound considerations are given for
 57972	his retreat from SmolÃ©nsk to OrshÃ¡. Then his heroism at KrÃ¡snoe is
 57973	described, where he is reported to have been prepared to accept battle
 57974	and take personal command, and to have walked about with a birch stick
 57975	and said:
 57976	
 57977	âJâai assez fait lâempereur; il est temps de faire le gÃ©nÃ©ral,â * but
 57978	nevertheless immediately ran away again, abandoning to its fate the
 57979	scattered fragments of the army he left behind.
 57980	
 57981	     * âI have acted the Emperor long enough; it is time to act
 57982	     the general.â
 57983	
 57984	
 57985	Then we are told of the greatness of soul of the marshals, especially
 57986	of Neyâa greatness of soul consisting in this: that he made his way by
 57987	night around through the forest and across the Dnieper and escaped to
 57988	OrshÃ¡, abandoning standards, artillery, and nine tenths of his men.
 57989	
 57990	And lastly, the final departure of the great Emperor from his heroic
 57991	army is presented to us by the historians as something great and
 57992	characteristic of genius. Even that final running away, described in
 57993	ordinary language as the lowest depth of baseness which every child
 57994	is taught to be ashamed ofâeven that act finds justification in the
 57995	historiansâ language.
 57996	
 57997	When it is impossible to stretch the very elastic threads of historical
 57998	ratiocination any farther, when actions are clearly contrary to all
 57999	that humanity calls right or even just, the historians produce a saving
 58000	conception of âgreatness.â âGreatness,â it seems, excludes the standards
 58001	of right and wrong. For the âgreatâ man nothing is wrong, there is no
 58002	atrocity for which a âgreatâ man can be blamed.
 58003	
 58004	âCâest grand!â * say the historians, and there no longer exists either
 58005	good or evil but only âgrandâ and ânot grand.â Grand is good, not
 58006	grand is bad. Grand is the characteristic, in their conception, of some
 58007	special animals called âheroes.â And Napoleon, escaping home in a warm
 58008	fur coat and leaving to perish those who were not merely his comrades
 58009	but were (in his opinion) men he had brought there, feels que câest
 58010	grand, *(2) and his soul is tranquil.
 58011	
 58012	     * âIt is great.â
 58013	
 58014	     * (2) That it is great.
 58015	
 58016	âDu sublime (he saw something sublime in himself) au ridicule il nây
 58017	a quâun pas,â * said he. And the whole world for fifty years has been
 58018	repeating: âSublime! Grand! NapolÃ©on le Grand!â Du sublime au ridicule
 58019	il nây a quâun pas.
 58020	
 58021	    * âFrom the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step.â
 58022	
 58023	
 58024	And it occurs to no one that to admit a greatness not commensurable with
 58025	the standard of right and wrong is merely to admit oneâs own nothingness
 58026	and immeasurable meanness.
 58027	
 58028	For us with the standard of good and evil given us by Christ, no human
 58029	actions are incommensurable. And there is no greatness where simplicity,
 58030	goodness, and truth are absent.

 58036	CHAPTER XIX
 58037	
 58038	What Russian, reading the account of the last part of the campaign
 58039	of 1812, has not experienced an uncomfortable feeling of regret,
 58040	dissatisfaction, and perplexity? Who has not asked himself how it is
 58041	that the French were not all captured or destroyed when our three armies
 58042	surrounded them in superior numbers, when the disordered French, hungry
 58043	and freezing, surrendered in crowds, and when (as the historians relate)
 58044	the aim of the Russians was to stop the French, to cut them off, and
 58045	capture them all?
 58046	
 58047	How was it that the Russian army, which when numerically weaker than the
 58048	French had given battle at BorodinÃ³, did not achieve its purpose when it
 58049	had surrounded the French on three sides and when its aim was to capture
 58050	them? Can the French be so enormously superior to us that when we had
 58051	surrounded them with superior forces we could not beat them? How could
 58052	that happen?
 58053	
 58054	History (or what is called by that name) replying to these questions
 58055	says that this occurred because KutÃºzov and TormÃ¡sov and ChichagÃ³v, and
 58056	this man and that man, did not execute such and such maneuvers....
 58057	
 58058	But why did they not execute those maneuvers? And why if they were
 58059	guilty of not carrying out a prearranged plan were they not tried and
 58060	punished? But even if we admitted that KutÃºzov, ChichagÃ³v, and others
 58061	were the cause of the Russian failures, it is still incomprehensible
 58062	why, the position of the Russian army being what it was at KrÃ¡snoe and
 58063	at the BerÃ«zina (in both cases we had superior forces), the French army
 58064	with its marshals, kings, and Emperor was not captured, if that was what
 58065	the Russians aimed at.
 58066	
 58067	The explanation of this strange fact given by Russian military
 58068	historians (to the effect that KutÃºzov hindered an attack) is unfounded,
 58069	for we know that he could not restrain the troops from attacking at
 58070	VyÃ¡zma and TarÃºtino.
 58071	
 58072	Why was the Russian armyâwhich with inferior forces had withstood the
 58073	enemy in full strength at BorodinÃ³âdefeated at KrÃ¡snoe and the BerÃ«zina
 58074	by the disorganized crowds of the French when it was numerically
 58075	superior?
 58076	
 58077	If the aim of the Russians consisted in cutting off and capturing
 58078	Napoleon and his marshalsâand that aim was not merely frustrated but all
 58079	attempts to attain it were most shamefully baffledâthen this last period
 58080	of the campaign is quite rightly considered by the French to be a
 58081	series of victories, and quite wrongly considered victorious by Russian
 58082	historians.
 58083	
 58084	The Russian military historians in so far as they submit to claims
 58085	of logic must admit that conclusion, and in spite of their lyrical
 58086	rhapsodies about valor, devotion, and so forth, must reluctantly admit
 58087	that the French retreat from Moscow was a series of victories for
 58088	Napoleon and defeats for KutÃºzov.
 58089	
 58090	But putting national vanity entirely aside one feels that such a
 58091	conclusion involves a contradiction, since the series of French
 58092	victories brought the French complete destruction, while the series
 58093	of Russian defeats led to the total destruction of their enemy and the
 58094	liberation of their country.
 58095	
 58096	The source of this contradiction lies in the fact that the historians
 58097	studying the events from the letters of the sovereigns and the generals,
 58098	from memoirs, reports, projects, and so forth, have attributed to this
 58099	last period of the war of 1812 an aim that never existed, namely that of
 58100	cutting off and capturing Napoleon with his marshals and his army.
 58101	
 58102	There never was or could have been such an aim, for it would have been
 58103	senseless and its attainment quite impossible.
 58104	
 58105	It would have been senseless, first because Napoleonâs disorganized
 58106	army was flying from Russia with all possible speed, that is to say, was
 58107	doing just what every Russian desired. So what was the use of performing
 58108	various operations on the French who were running away as fast as they
 58109	possibly could?
 58110	
 58111	Secondly, it would have been senseless to block the passage of men whose
 58112	whole energy was directed to flight.
 58113	
 58114	Thirdly, it would have been senseless to sacrifice oneâs own troops in
 58115	order to destroy the French army, which without external interference
 58116	was destroying itself at such a rate that, though its path was not
 58117	blocked, it could not carry across the frontier more than it actually
 58118	did in December, namely a hundredth part of the original army.
 58119	
 58120	Fourthly, it would have been senseless to wish to take captive the
 58121	Emperor, kings, and dukesâwhose capture would have been in the highest
 58122	degree embarrassing for the Russians, as the most adroit diplomatists of
 58123	the time (Joseph de Maistre and others) recognized. Still more senseless
 58124	would have been the wish to capture army corps of the French, when our
 58125	own army had melted away to half before reaching KrÃ¡snoe and a whole
 58126	division would have been needed to convoy the corps of prisoners, and
 58127	when our men were not always getting full rations and the prisoners
 58128	already taken were perishing of hunger.
 58129	
 58130	All the profound plans about cutting off and capturing Napoleon and his
 58131	army were like the plan of a market gardener who, when driving out of
 58132	his garden a cow that had trampled down the beds he had planted, should
 58133	run to the gate and hit the cow on the head. The only thing to be said
 58134	in excuse of that gardener would be that he was very angry. But not even
 58135	that could be said for those who drew up this project, for it was not
 58136	they who had suffered from the trampled beds.
 58137	
 58138	But besides the fact that cutting off Napoleon with his army would have
 58139	been senseless, it was impossible.
 58140	
 58141	It was impossible first becauseâas experience shows that a three-mile
 58142	movement of columns on a battlefield never coincides with the plansâthe
 58143	probability of ChichagÃ³v, KutÃºzov, and Wittgenstein effecting a junction
 58144	on time at an appointed place was so remote as to be tantamount to
 58145	impossibility, as in fact thought KutÃºzov, who when he received the plan
 58146	remarked that diversions planned over great distances do not yield the
 58147	desired results.
 58148	
 58149	Secondly it was impossible, because to paralyze the momentum with which
 58150	Napoleonâs army was retiring, incomparably greater forces than the
 58151	Russians possessed would have been required.
 58152	
 58153	Thirdly it was impossible, because the military term âto cut offâ has no
 58154	meaning. One can cut off a slice of bread, but not an army. To cut off
 58155	an armyâto bar its roadâis quite impossible, for there is always plenty
 58156	of room to avoid capture and there is the night when nothing can be
 58157	seen, as the military scientists might convince themselves by the
 58158	example of KrÃ¡snoe and of the BerÃ«zina. It is only possible to capture
 58159	prisoners if they agree to be captured, just as it is only possible
 58160	to catch a swallow if it settles on oneâs hand. Men can only be taken
 58161	prisoners if they surrender according to the rules of strategy and
 58162	tactics, as the Germans did. But the French troops quite rightly did not
 58163	consider that this suited them, since death by hunger and cold awaited
 58164	them in flight or captivity alike.
 58165	
 58166	Fourthly and chiefly it was impossible, because never since the world
 58167	began has a war been fought under such conditions as those that obtained
 58168	in 1812, and the Russian army in its pursuit of the French strained its
 58169	strength to the utmost and could not have done more without destroying
 58170	itself.
 58171	
 58172	During the movement of the Russian army from TarÃºtino to KrÃ¡snoe it
 58173	lost fifty thousand sick or stragglers, that is a number equal to the
 58174	population of a large provincial town. Half the men fell out of the army
 58175	without a battle.
 58176	
 58177	And it is of this period of the campaignâwhen the army lacked boots
 58178	and sheepskin coats, was short of provisions and without vodka, and
 58179	was camping out at night for months in the snow with fifteen degrees
 58180	of frost, when there were only seven or eight hours of daylight and
 58181	the rest was night in which the influence of discipline cannot be
 58182	maintained, when men were taken into that region of death where
 58183	discipline fails, not for a few hours only as in a battle, but for
 58184	months, where they were every moment fighting death from hunger and
 58185	cold, when half the army perished in a single monthâit is of this period
 58186	of the campaign that the historians tell us how MilorÃ¡dovich should have
 58187	made a flank march to such and such a place, TormÃ¡sov to another place,
 58188	and ChichagÃ³v should have crossed (more than knee-deep in snow) to
 58189	somewhere else, and how so-and-so âroutedâ and âcut offâ the French and
 58190	so on and so on.
 58191	
 58192	The Russians, half of whom died, did all that could and should have been
 58193	done to attain an end worthy of the nation, and they are not to blame
 58194	because other Russians, sitting in warm rooms, proposed that they should
 58195	do what was impossible.
 58196	
 58197	All that strange contradiction now difficult to understand between the
 58198	facts and the historical accounts only arises because the historians
 58199	dealing with the matter have written the history of the beautiful words
 58200	and sentiments of various generals, and not the history of the events.
 58201	
 58202	To them the words of MilorÃ¡dovich seem very interesting, and so do their
 58203	surmises and the rewards this or that general received; but the question
 58204	of those fifty thousand men who were left in hospitals and in graves
 58205	does not even interest them, for it does not come within the range of
 58206	their investigation.
 58207	
 58208	Yet one need only discard the study of the reports and general plans and
 58209	consider the movement of those hundreds of thousands of men who took a
 58210	direct part in the events, and all the questions that seemed insoluble
 58211	easily and simply receive an immediate and certain solution.
 58212	
 58213	The aim of cutting off Napoleon and his army never existed except in
 58214	the imaginations of a dozen people. It could not exist because it was
 58215	senseless and unattainable.
 58216	
 58217	The people had a single aim: to free their land from invasion. That aim
 58218	was attained in the first place of itself, as the French ran away,
 58219	and so it was only necessary not to stop their flight. Secondly it was
 58220	attained by the guerrilla warfare which was destroying the French, and
 58221	thirdly by the fact that a large Russian army was following the French,
 58222	ready to use its strength in case their movement stopped.
 58223	
 58224	The Russian army had to act like a whip to a running animal. And the
 58225	experienced driver knew it was better to hold the whip raised as a
 58226	menace than to strike the running animal on the head.

 58238	CHAPTER I
 58239	
 58240	When seeing a dying animal a man feels a sense of horror: substance
 58241	similar to his own is perishing before his eyes. But when it is a
 58242	beloved and intimate human being that is dying, besides this horror at
 58243	the extinction of life there is a severance, a spiritual wound, which
 58244	like a physical wound is sometimes fatal and sometimes heals, but always
 58245	aches and shrinks at any external irritating touch.
 58246	
 58247	After Prince Andrewâs death NatÃ¡sha and Princess Mary alike felt this.
 58248	Drooping in spirit and closing their eyes before the menacing cloud of
 58249	death that overhung them, they dared not look life in the face. They
 58250	carefully guarded their open wounds from any rough and painful contact.
 58251	Everything: a carriage passing rapidly in the street, a summons to
 58252	dinner, the maidâs inquiry what dress to prepare, or worse still any
 58253	word of insincere or feeble sympathy, seemed an insult, painfully
 58254	irritated the wound, interrupting that necessary quiet in which
 58255	they both tried to listen to the stern and dreadful choir that still
 58256	resounded in their imagination, and hindered their gazing into those
 58257	mysterious limitless vistas that for an instant had opened out before
 58258	them.
 58259	
 58260	Only when alone together were they free from such outrage and pain.
 58261	They spoke little even to one another, and when they did it was of very
 58262	unimportant matters.
 58263	
 58264	Both avoided any allusion to the future. To admit the possibility of
 58265	a future seemed to them to insult his memory. Still more carefully did
 58266	they avoid anything relating to him who was dead. It seemed to them that
 58267	what they had lived through and experienced could not be expressed in
 58268	words, and that any reference to the details of his life infringed the
 58269	majesty and sacredness of the mystery that had been accomplished before
 58270	their eyes.
 58271	
 58272	Continued abstention from speech, and constant avoidance of everything
 58273	that might lead up to the subjectâthis halting on all sides at the
 58274	boundary of what they might not mentionâbrought before their minds with
 58275	still greater purity and clearness what they were both feeling.
 58276	
 58277	But pure and complete sorrow is as impossible as pure and complete joy.
 58278	Princess Mary, in her position as absolute and independent arbiter of
 58279	her own fate and guardian and instructor of her nephew, was the first to
 58280	be called back to life from that realm of sorrow in which she had dwelt
 58281	for the first fortnight. She received letters from her relations to
 58282	which she had to reply; the room in which little Nicholas had been put
 58283	was damp and he began to cough; AlpÃ¡tych came to YaroslÃ¡vl with reports
 58284	on the state of their affairs and with advice and suggestions that they
 58285	should return to Moscow to the house on the VozdvÃ­zhenka Street, which
 58286	had remained uninjured and needed only slight repairs. Life did not
 58287	stand still and it was necessary to live. Hard as it was for Princess
 58288	Mary to emerge from the realm of secluded contemplation in which she
 58289	had lived till then, and sorry and almost ashamed as she felt to leave
 58290	NatÃ¡sha alone, yet the cares of life demanded her attention and she
 58291	involuntarily yielded to them. She went through the accounts with
 58292	AlpÃ¡tych, conferred with Dessalles about her nephew, and gave orders and
 58293	made preparations for the journey to Moscow.
 58294	
 58295	NatÃ¡sha remained alone and, from the time Princess Mary began making
 58296	preparations for departure, held aloof from her too.
 58297	
 58298	Princess Mary asked the countess to let NatÃ¡sha go with her to Moscow,
 58299	and both parents gladly accepted this offer, for they saw their daughter
 58300	losing strength every day and thought that a change of scene and the
 58301	advice of Moscow doctors would be good for her.
 58302	
 58303	âI am not going anywhere,â NatÃ¡sha replied when this was proposed to
 58304	her. âDo please just leave me alone!â And she ran out of the room, with
 58305	difficulty refraining from tears of vexation and irritation rather than
 58306	of sorrow.
 58307	
 58308	After she felt herself deserted by Princes Mary and alone in her grief,
 58309	NatÃ¡sha spent most of the time in her room by herself, sitting huddled
 58310	up feet and all in the corner of the sofa, tearing and twisting
 58311	something with her slender nervous fingers and gazing intently and
 58312	fixedly at whatever her eyes chanced to fall on. This solitude exhausted
 58313	and tormented her but she was in absolute need of it. As soon as anyone
 58314	entered she got up quickly, changed her position and expression, and
 58315	picked up a book or some sewing, evidently waiting impatiently for the
 58316	intruder to go.
 58317	
 58318	She felt all the time as if she might at any moment penetrate that
 58319	on whichâwith a terrible questioning too great for her strengthâher
 58320	spiritual gaze was fixed.
 58321	
 58322	One day toward the end of December NatÃ¡sha, pale and thin, dressed in a
 58323	black woolen gown, her plaited hair negligently twisted into a knot, was
 58324	crouched feet and all in the corner of her sofa, nervously crumpling and
 58325	smoothing out the end of her sash while she looked at a corner of the
 58326	door.
 58327	
 58328	She was gazing in the direction in which he had goneâto the other side
 58329	of life. And that other side of life, of which she had never before
 58330	thought and which had formerly seemed to her so far away and improbable,
 58331	was now nearer and more akin and more comprehensible than this side of
 58332	life, where everything was either emptiness and desolation or suffering
 58333	and indignity.
 58334	
 58335	She was gazing where she knew him to be; but she could not imagine him
 58336	otherwise than as he had been here. She now saw him again as he had been
 58337	at MytÃ­shchi, at TrÃ³itsa, and at YaroslÃ¡vl.
 58338	
 58339	She saw his face, heard his voice, repeated his words and her own, and
 58340	sometimes devised other words they might have spoken.
 58341	
 58342	There he is lying back in an armchair in his velvet cloak, leaning
 58343	his head on his thin pale hand. His chest is dreadfully hollow and his
 58344	shoulders raised. His lips are firmly closed, his eyes glitter, and a
 58345	wrinkle comes and goes on his pale forehead. One of his legs twitches
 58346	just perceptibly, but rapidly. NatÃ¡sha knows that he is struggling with
 58347	terrible pain. âWhat is that pain like? Why does he have that pain? What
 58348	does he feel? How does it hurt him?â thought NatÃ¡sha. He noticed her
 58349	watching him, raised his eyes, and began to speak seriously:
 58350	
 58351	âOne thing would be terrible,â said he: âto bind oneself forever to a
 58352	suffering man. It would be continual torture.â And he looked searchingly
 58353	at her. NatÃ¡sha as usual answered before she had time to think what she
 58354	would say. She said: âThis canât go onâit wonât. You will get wellâquite
 58355	well.â
 58356	
 58357	She now saw him from the commencement of that scene and relived what she
 58358	had then felt. She recalled his long sad and severe look at those words
 58359	and understood the meaning of the rebuke and despair in that protracted
 58360	gaze.
 58361	
 58362	âI agreed,â NatÃ¡sha now said to herself, âthat it would be dreadful if
 58363	he always continued to suffer. I said it then only because it would have
 58364	been dreadful for him, but he understood it differently. He thought it
 58365	would be dreadful for me. He then still wished to live and feared death.
 58366	And I said it so awkwardly and stupidly! I did not say what I meant.
 58367	I thought quite differently. Had I said what I thought, I should have
 58368	said: even if he had to go on dying, to die continually before my eyes,
 58369	I should have been happy compared with what I am now. Now there is
 58370	nothing... nobody. Did he know that? No, he did not and never will know
 58371	it. And now it will never, never be possible to put it right.â And
 58372	now he again seemed to be saying the same words to her, only in her
 58373	imagination NatÃ¡sha this time gave him a different answer. She stopped
 58374	him and said: âTerrible for you, but not for me! You know that for me
 58375	there is nothing in life but you, and to suffer with you is the greatest
 58376	happiness for me,â and he took her hand and pressed it as he had
 58377	pressed it that terrible evening four days before his death. And in her
 58378	imagination she said other tender and loving words which she might have
 58379	said then but only spoke now: âI love thee!... thee! I love, love...â
 58380	she said, convulsively pressing her hands and setting her teeth with a
 58381	desperate effort....
 58382	
 58383	She was overcome by sweet sorrow and tears were already rising in her
 58384	eyes; then she suddenly asked herself to whom she was saying this.
 58385	Again everything was shrouded in hard, dry perplexity, and again with a
 58386	strained frown she peered toward the world where he was. And now, now
 58387	it seemed to her she was penetrating the mystery.... But at the instant
 58388	when it seemed that the incomprehensible was revealing itself to her a
 58389	loud rattle of the door handle struck painfully on her ears. DunyÃ¡sha,
 58390	her maid, entered the room quickly and abruptly with a frightened look
 58391	on her face and showing no concern for her mistress.
 58392	
 58393	âCome to your Papa at once, please!â said she with a strange, excited
 58394	look. âA misfortune... about Peter IlÃ½nich... a letter,â she finished
 58395	with a sob.
 58396	
 58397	
 58398	
 58399	
 58400	
 58401	CHAPTER II
 58402	
 58403	Besides a feeling of aloofness from everybody NatÃ¡sha was feeling a
 58404	special estrangement from the members of her own family. All of
 58405	themâher father, mother, and SÃ³nyaâwere so near to her, so familiar, so
 58406	commonplace, that all their words and feelings seemed an insult to the
 58407	world in which she had been living of late, and she felt not merely
 58408	indifferent to them but regarded them with hostility. She heard
 58409	DunyÃ¡shaâs words about Peter IlÃ½nich and a misfortune, but did not grasp
 58410	them.
 58411	
 58412	âWhat misfortune? What misfortune can happen to them? They just live
 58413	their own old, quiet, and commonplace life,â thought NatÃ¡sha.
 58414	
 58415	As she entered the ballroom her father was hurriedly coming out of
 58416	her motherâs room. His face was puckered up and wet with tears. He
 58417	had evidently run out of that room to give vent to the sobs that were
 58418	choking him. When he saw NatÃ¡sha he waved his arms despairingly and
 58419	burst into convulsively painful sobs that distorted his soft round face.
 58420	
 58421	âPe... PÃ©tya... Go, go, she... is calling...â and weeping like a child
 58422	and quickly shuffling on his feeble legs to a chair, he almost fell into
 58423	it, covering his face with his hands.
 58424	
 58425	Suddenly an electric shock seemed to run through NatÃ¡shaâs whole being.
 58426	Terrible anguish struck her heart, she felt a dreadful ache as if
 58427	something was being torn inside her and she were dying. But the pain
 58428	was immediately followed by a feeling of release from the oppressive
 58429	constraint that had prevented her taking part in life. The sight of her
 58430	father, the terribly wild cries of her mother that she heard through the
 58431	door, made her immediately forget herself and her own grief.
 58432	
 58433	She ran to her father, but he feebly waved his arm, pointing to her
 58434	motherâs door. Princess Mary, pale and with quivering chin, came out
 58435	from that room and taking NatÃ¡sha by the arm said something to her.
 58436	NatÃ¡sha neither saw nor heard her. She went in with rapid steps, pausing
 58437	at the door for an instant as if struggling with herself, and then ran
 58438	to her mother.
 58439	
 58440	The countess was lying in an armchair in a strange and awkward position,
 58441	stretching out and beating her head against the wall. SÃ³nya and the
 58442	maids were holding her arms.
 58443	
 58444	âNatÃ¡sha! NatÃ¡sha!...â cried the countess. âItâs not true... itâs not
 58445	true... Heâs lying... NatÃ¡sha!â she shrieked, pushing those around her
 58446	away. âGo away, all of you; itâs not true! Killed!... ha, ha, ha!...
 58447	Itâs not true!â
 58448	
 58449	NatÃ¡sha put one knee on the armchair, stooped over her mother, embraced
 58450	her, and with unexpected strength raised her, turned her face toward
 58451	herself, and clung to her.
 58452	
 58453	âMummy!... darling!... I am here, my dearest Mummy,â she kept on
 58454	whispering, not pausing an instant.
 58455	
 58456	She did not let go of her mother but struggled tenderly with her,
 58457	demanded a pillow and hot water, and unfastened and tore open her
 58458	motherâs dress.
 58459	
 58460	âMy dearest darling... Mummy, my precious!...â she whispered
 58461	incessantly, kissing her head, her hands, her face, and feeling her own
 58462	irrepressible and streaming tears tickling her nose and cheeks.
 58463	
 58464	The countess pressed her daughterâs hand, closed her eyes, and became
 58465	quiet for a moment. Suddenly she sat up with unaccustomed swiftness,
 58466	glanced vacantly around her, and seeing NatÃ¡sha began to press her
 58467	daughterâs head with all her strength. Then she turned toward her
 58468	daughterâs face which was wincing with pain and gazed long at it.
 58469	
 58470	âNatÃ¡sha, you love me?â she said in a soft trustful whisper. âNatÃ¡sha,
 58471	you would not deceive me? Youâll tell me the whole truth?â
 58472	
 58473	NatÃ¡sha looked at her with eyes full of tears and in her look there was
 58474	nothing but love and an entreaty for forgiveness.
 58475	
 58476	âMy darling Mummy!â she repeated, straining all the power of her love to
 58477	find some way of taking on herself the excess of grief that crushed her
 58478	mother.
 58479	
 58480	And again in a futile struggle with reality her mother, refusing to
 58481	believe that she could live when her beloved boy was killed in the bloom
 58482	of life, escaped from reality into a world of delirium.
 58483	
 58484	NatÃ¡sha did not remember how that day passed nor that night, nor the
 58485	next day and night. She did not sleep and did not leave her mother. Her
 58486	persevering and patient love seemed completely to surround the countess
 58487	every moment, not explaining or consoling, but recalling her to life.
 58488	
 58489	During the third night the countess kept very quiet for a few minutes,
 58490	and NatÃ¡sha rested her head on the arm of her chair and closed her eyes,
 58491	but opened them again on hearing the bedstead creak. The countess was
 58492	sitting up in bed and speaking softly.
 58493	
 58494	âHow glad I am you have come. You are tired. Wonât you have some tea?â
 58495	NatÃ¡sha went up to her. âYou have improved in looks and grown more
 58496	manly,â continued the countess, taking her daughterâs hand.
 58497	
 58498	âMamma! What are you saying...â
 58499	
 58500	âNatÃ¡sha, he is no more, no more!â
 58501	
 58502	And embracing her daughter, the countess began to weep for the first
 58503	time.
 58504	
 58505	
 58506	
 58507	
 58508	
 58509	CHAPTER III
 58510	
 58511	Princess Mary postponed her departure. SÃ³nya and the count tried to
 58512	replace NatÃ¡sha but could not. They saw that she alone was able to
 58513	restrain her mother from unreasoning despair. For three weeks NatÃ¡sha
 58514	remained constantly at her motherâs side, sleeping on a lounge chair
 58515	in her room, making her eat and drink, and talking to her incessantly
 58516	because the mere sound of her tender, caressing tones soothed her
 58517	mother.
 58518	
 58519	The motherâs wounded spirit could not heal. PÃ©tyaâs death had torn from
 58520	her half her life. When the news of PÃ©tyaâs death had come she had been
 58521	a fresh and vigorous woman of fifty, but a month later she left her room
 58522	a listless old woman taking no interest in life. But the same blow that
 58523	almost killed the countess, this second blow, restored NatÃ¡sha to life.
 58524	
 58525	A spiritual wound produced by a rending of the spiritual body is like
 58526	a physical wound and, strange as it may seem, just as a deep wound may
 58527	heal and its edges join, physical and spiritual wounds alike can yet
 58528	heal completely only as the result of a vital force from within.
 58529	
 58530	NatÃ¡shaâs wound healed in that way. She thought her life was ended,
 58531	but her love for her mother unexpectedly showed her that the essence of
 58532	lifeâloveâwas still active within her. Love awoke and so did life.
 58533	
 58534	Prince Andrewâs last days had bound Princess Mary and NatÃ¡sha together;
 58535	this new sorrow brought them still closer to one another. Princess Mary
 58536	put off her departure, and for three weeks looked after NatÃ¡sha as if
 58537	she had been a sick child. The last weeks passed in her motherâs bedroom
 58538	had strained NatÃ¡shaâs physical strength.
 58539	
 58540	One afternoon noticing NatÃ¡sha shivering with fever, Princess Mary took
 58541	her to her own room and made her lie down on the bed. NatÃ¡sha lay down,
 58542	but when Princess Mary had drawn the blinds and was going away she
 58543	called her back.
 58544	
 58545	âI donât want to sleep, Mary, sit by me a little.â
 58546	
 58547	âYou are tiredâtry to sleep.â
 58548	
 58549	âNo, no. Why did you bring me away? She will be asking for me.â
 58550	
 58551	âShe is much better. She spoke so well today,â said Princess Mary.
 58552	
 58553	NatÃ¡sha lay on the bed and in the semidarkness of the room scanned
 58554	Princess Maryâs face.
 58555	
 58556	âIs she like him?â thought NatÃ¡sha. âYes, like and yet not like. But she
 58557	is quite original, strange, new, and unknown. And she loves me. What
 58558	is in her heart? All that is good. But how? What is her mind like? What
 58559	does she think about me? Yes, she is splendid!â
 58560	
 58561	âMary,â she said timidly, drawing Princess Maryâs hand to herself,
 58562	âMary, you mustnât think me wicked. No? Mary darling, how I love you!
 58563	Let us be quite, quite friends.â
 58564	
 58565	And NatÃ¡sha, embracing her, began kissing her face and hands, making
 58566	Princess Mary feel shy but happy by this demonstration of her feelings.
 58567	
 58568	From that day a tender and passionate friendship such as exists only
 58569	between women was established between Princess Mary and NatÃ¡sha. They
 58570	were continually kissing and saying tender things to one another and
 58571	spent most of their time together. When one went out the other became
 58572	restless and hastened to rejoin her. Together they felt more in harmony
 58573	with one another than either of them felt with herself when alone. A
 58574	feeling stronger than friendship sprang up between them; an exclusive
 58575	feeling of life being possible only in each otherâs presence.
 58576	
 58577	Sometimes they were silent for hours; sometimes after they were already
 58578	in bed they would begin talking and go on till morning. They spoke most
 58579	of what was long past. Princess Mary spoke of her childhood, of her
 58580	mother, her father, and her daydreams; and NatÃ¡sha, who with a passive
 58581	lack of understanding had formerly turned away from that life of
 58582	devotion, submission, and the poetry of Christian self-sacrifice, now
 58583	feeling herself bound to Princess Mary by affection, learned to love her
 58584	past too and to understand a side of life previously incomprehensible to
 58585	her. She did not think of applying submission and self-abnegation to her
 58586	own life, for she was accustomed to seek other joys, but she understood
 58587	and loved in another those previously incomprehensible virtues. For
 58588	Princess Mary, listening to NatÃ¡shaâs tales of childhood and early
 58589	youth, there also opened out a new and hitherto uncomprehended side of
 58590	life: belief in life and its enjoyment.
 58591	
 58592	Just as before, they never mentioned him so as not to lower (as they
 58593	thought) their exalted feelings by words; but this silence about him had
 58594	the effect of making them gradually begin to forget him without being
 58595	conscious of it.
 58596	
 58597	NatÃ¡sha had grown thin and pale and physically so weak that they all
 58598	talked about her health, and this pleased her. But sometimes she was
 58599	suddenly overcome by fear not only of death but of sickness, weakness,
 58600	and loss of good looks, and involuntarily she examined her bare arm
 58601	carefully, surprised at its thinness, and in the morning noticed her
 58602	drawn and, as it seemed to her, piteous face in her glass. It seemed to
 58603	her that things must be so, and yet it was dreadfully sad.
 58604	
 58605	One day she went quickly upstairs and found herself out of breath.
 58606	Unconsciously she immediately invented a reason for going down, and
 58607	then, testing her strength, ran upstairs again, observing the result.
 58608	
 58609	Another time when she called DunyÃ¡sha her voice trembled, so she called
 58610	againâthough she could hear DunyÃ¡sha comingâcalled her in the deep chest
 58611	tones in which she had been wont to sing, and listened attentively to
 58612	herself.
 58613	
 58614	She did not know and would not have believed it, but beneath the layer
 58615	of slime that covered her soul and seemed to her impenetrable, delicate
 58616	young shoots of grass were already sprouting, which taking root would so
 58617	cover with their living verdure the grief that weighed her down that
 58618	it would soon no longer be seen or noticed. The wound had begun to heal
 58619	from within.
 58620	
 58621	At the end of January Princess Mary left for Moscow, and the count
 58622	insisted on NatÃ¡shaâs going with her to consult the doctors.
 58623	
 58624	
 58625	
 58626	
 58627	
 58628	CHAPTER IV
 58629	
 58630	After the encounter at VyÃ¡zma, where KutÃºzov had been unable to hold
 58631	back his troops in their anxiety to overwhelm and cut off the enemy and
 58632	so on, the farther movement of the fleeing French, and of the Russians
 58633	who pursued them, continued as far as KrÃ¡snoe without a battle. The
 58634	flight was so rapid that the Russian army pursuing the French could
 58635	not keep up with them; cavalry and artillery horses broke down, and the
 58636	information received of the movements of the French was never reliable.
 58637	
 58638	The men in the Russian army were so worn out by this continuous marching
 58639	at the rate of twenty-seven miles a day that they could not go any
 58640	faster.
 58641	
 58642	To realize the degree of exhaustion of the Russian army it is only
 58643	necessary to grasp clearly the meaning of the fact that, while not
 58644	losing more than five thousand killed and wounded after TarÃºtino and
 58645	less than a hundred prisoners, the Russian army which left that place a
 58646	hundred thousand strong reached KrÃ¡snoe with only fifty thousand.
 58647	
 58648	The rapidity of the Russian pursuit was just as destructive to our army
 58649	as the flight of the French was to theirs. The only difference was that
 58650	the Russian army moved voluntarily, with no such threat of destruction
 58651	as hung over the French, and that the sick Frenchmen were left behind
 58652	in enemy hands while the sick Russians left behind were among their
 58653	own people. The chief cause of the wastage of Napoleonâs army was
 58654	the rapidity of its movement, and a convincing proof of this is the
 58655	corresponding decrease of the Russian army.
 58656	
 58657	KutÃºzov as far as was in his power, instead of trying to check the
 58658	movement of the French as was desired in Petersburg and by the Russian
 58659	army generals, directed his whole activity here, as he had done at
 58660	TarÃºtino and VyÃ¡zma, to hastening it on while easing the movement of our
 58661	army.
 58662	
 58663	But besides this, since the exhaustion and enormous diminution of the
 58664	army caused by the rapidity of the advance had become evident, another
 58665	reason for slackening the pace and delaying presented itself to KutÃºzov.
 58666	The aim of the Russian army was to pursue the French. The road the
 58667	French would take was unknown, and so the closer our troops trod on
 58668	their heels the greater distance they had to cover. Only by following
 58669	at some distance could one cut across the zigzag path of the French. All
 58670	the artful maneuvers suggested by our generals meant fresh movements of
 58671	the army and a lengthening of its marches, whereas the only reasonable
 58672	aim was to shorten those marches. To that end KutÃºzovâs activity was
 58673	directed during the whole campaign from Moscow to VÃ­lnaânot casually or
 58674	intermittently but so consistently that he never once deviated from it.
 58675	
 58676	KutÃºzov felt and knewânot by reasoning or science but with the whole of
 58677	his Russian beingâwhat every Russian soldier felt: that the French were
 58678	beaten, that the enemy was flying and must be driven out; but at the
 58679	same time he like the soldiers realized all the hardship of this march,
 58680	the rapidity of which was unparalleled for such a time of the year.
 58681	
 58682	But to the generals, especially the foreign ones in the Russian army,
 58683	who wished to distinguish themselves, to astonish somebody, and for some
 58684	reason to capture a king or a dukeâit seemed that nowâwhen any battle
 58685	must be horrible and senselessâwas the very time to fight and conquer
 58686	somebody. KutÃºzov merely shrugged his shoulders when one after
 58687	another they presented projects of maneuvers to be made with those
 58688	soldiersâill-shod, insufficiently clad, and half starvedâwho within a
 58689	month and without fighting a battle had dwindled to half their number,
 58690	and who at the best if the flight continued would have to go a greater
 58691	distance than they had already traversed, before they reached the
 58692	frontier.
 58693	
 58694	This longing to distinguish themselves, to maneuver, to overthrow, and
 58695	to cut off showed itself particularly whenever the Russians stumbled on
 58696	the French army.
 58697	
 58698	So it was at KrÃ¡snoe, where they expected to find one of the three
 58699	French columns and stumbled instead on Napoleon himself with sixteen
 58700	thousand men. Despite all KutÃºzovâs efforts to avoid that ruinous
 58701	encounter and to preserve his troops, the massacre of the broken mob
 58702	of French soldiers by worn-out Russians continued at KrÃ¡snoe for three
 58703	days.
 58704	
 58705	Toll wrote a disposition: âThe first column will march to so and so,â
 58706	etc. And as usual nothing happened in accord with the disposition.
 58707	Prince EugÃ¨ne of WÃ¼rttemberg fired from a hill over the French crowds
 58708	that were running past, and demanded reinforcements which did not
 58709	arrive. The French, avoiding the Russians, dispersed and hid themselves
 58710	in the forest by night, making their way round as best they could, and
 58711	continued their flight.
 58712	
 58713	MilorÃ¡dovich, who said he did not want to know anything about the
 58714	commissariat affairs of his detachment, and could never be found when
 58715	he was wantedâthat chevalier sans peur et sans reproche * as he styled
 58716	himselfâwho was fond of parleys with the French, sent envoys demanding
 58717	their surrender, wasted time, and did not do what he was ordered to do.
 58718	
 58719	    * Knight without fear and without reproach.
 58720	
 58721	âI give you that column, lads,â he said, riding up to the troops and
 58722	pointing out the French to the cavalry.
 58723	
 58724	And the cavalry, with spurs and sabers urging on horses that could
 58725	scarcely move, trotted with much effort to the column presented
 58726	to themâthat is to say, to a crowd of Frenchmen stark with cold,
 58727	frost-bitten, and starvingâand the column that had been presented to
 58728	them threw down its arms and surrendered as it had long been anxious to
 58729	do.
 58730	
 58731	At KrÃ¡snoe they took twenty-six thousand prisoners, several hundred
 58732	cannon, and a stick called a âmarshalâs staff,â and disputed as to who
 58733	had distinguished himself and were pleased with their achievementâthough
 58734	they much regretted not having taken Napoleon, or at least a marshal or
 58735	a hero of some sort, and reproached one another and especially KutÃºzov
 58736	for having failed to do so.
 58737	
 58738	These men, carried away by their passions, were but blind tools of the
 58739	most melancholy law of necessity, but considered themselves heroes and
 58740	imagined that they were accomplishing a most noble and honorable
 58741	deed. They blamed KutÃºzov and said that from the very beginning of the
 58742	campaign he had prevented their vanquishing Napoleon, that he thought of
 58743	nothing but satisfying his passions and would not advance from the Linen
 58744	Factories because he was comfortable there, that at KrÃ¡snoe he checked
 58745	the advance because on learning that Napoleon was there he had quite
 58746	lost his head, and that it was probable that he had an understanding
 58747	with Napoleon and had been bribed by him, and so on, and so on.
 58748	
 58749	Not only did his contemporaries, carried away by their passions, talk
 58750	in this way, but posterity and history have acclaimed Napoleon as grand,
 58751	while KutÃºzov is described by foreigners as a crafty, dissolute, weak
 58752	old courtier, and by Russians as something indefiniteâa sort of puppet
 58753	useful only because he had a Russian name.

 58759	CHAPTER V
 58760	
 58761	In 1812 and 1813 KutÃºzov was openly accused of blundering. The Emperor
 58762	was dissatisfied with him. And in a history recently written by order
 58763	of the Highest Authorities it is said that KutÃºzov was a cunning court
 58764	liar, frightened of the name of Napoleon, and that by his blunders at
 58765	KrÃ¡snoe and the BerÃ«zina he deprived the Russian army of the glory of
 58766	complete victory over the French. *
 58767	
 58768	     * History of the year 1812. The character of KutÃºzov and
 58769	     reflections on the unsatisfactory results of the battles at
 58770	     KrÃ¡snoe, by BogdÃ¡novich.
 58771	
 58772	Such is the fate not of great men (grands hommes) whom the Russian mind
 58773	does not acknowledge, but of those rare and always solitary individuals
 58774	who, discerning the will of Providence, submit their personal will to
 58775	it. The hatred and contempt of the crowd punish such men for discerning
 58776	the higher laws.
 58777	
 58778	For Russian historians, strange and terrible to say, Napoleonâthat most
 58779	insignificant tool of history who never anywhere, even in exile, showed
 58780	human dignityâNapoleon is the object of adulation and enthusiasm; he
 58781	is grand. But KutÃºzovâthe man who from the beginning to the end of his
 58782	activity in 1812, never once swerving by word or deed from BorodinÃ³ to
 58783	VÃ­lna, presented an example exceptional in history of self-sacrifice
 58784	and a present consciousness of the future importance of what was
 58785	happeningâKutÃºzov seems to them something indefinite and pitiful, and
 58786	when speaking of him and of the year 1812 they always seem a little
 58787	ashamed.
 58788	
 58789	And yet it is difficult to imagine an historical character whose
 58790	activity was so unswervingly directed to a single aim; and it would be
 58791	difficult to imagine any aim more worthy or more consonant with the
 58792	will of the whole people. Still more difficult would it be to find
 58793	an instance in history of the aim of an historical personage being so
 58794	completely accomplished as that to which all KutÃºzovâs efforts were
 58795	directed in 1812.
 58796	
 58797	KutÃºzov never talked of âforty centuries looking down from the
 58798	Pyramids,â of the sacrifices he offered for the fatherland, or of
 58799	what he intended to accomplish or had accomplished; in general he
 58800	said nothing about himself, adopted no pose, always appeared to be
 58801	the simplest and most ordinary of men, and said the simplest and most
 58802	ordinary things. He wrote letters to his daughters and to Madame de
 58803	StaÃ«l, read novels, liked the society of pretty women, jested with
 58804	generals, officers, and soldiers, and never contradicted those who tried
 58805	to prove anything to him. When Count RostopchÃ­n at the YaÃºza bridge
 58806	galloped up to KutÃºzov with personal reproaches for having caused the
 58807	destruction of Moscow, and said: âHow was it you promised not to abandon
 58808	Moscow without a battle?â KutÃºzov replied: âAnd I shall not abandon
 58809	Moscow without a battle,â though Moscow was then already abandoned. When
 58810	ArakchÃ©ev, coming to him from the Emperor, said that ErmÃ³lov ought to
 58811	be appointed chief of the artillery, KutÃºzov replied: âYes, I was
 58812	just saying so myself,â though a moment before he had said quite the
 58813	contrary. What did it matter to himâwho then alone amid a senseless
 58814	crowd understood the whole tremendous significance of what was
 58815	happeningâwhat did it matter to him whether RostopchÃ­n attributed the
 58816	calamities of Moscow to him or to himself? Still less could it matter to
 58817	him who was appointed chief of the artillery.
 58818	
 58819	Not merely in these cases but continually did that old manâwho by
 58820	experience of life had reached the conviction that thoughts and the
 58821	words serving as their expression are not what move peopleâuse quite
 58822	meaningless words that happened to enter his head.
 58823	
 58824	But that man, so heedless of his words, did not once during the whole
 58825	time of his activity utter one word inconsistent with the single aim
 58826	toward which he moved throughout the whole war. Obviously in spite of
 58827	himself, in very diverse circumstances, he repeatedly expressed his real
 58828	thoughts with the bitter conviction that he would not be understood.
 58829	Beginning with the battle of BorodinÃ³, from which time his disagreement
 58830	with those about him began, he alone said that the battle of BorodinÃ³
 58831	was a victory, and repeated this both verbally and in his dispatches
 58832	and reports up to the time of his death. He alone said that the loss of
 58833	Moscow is not the loss of Russia. In reply to Lauristonâs proposal of
 58834	peace, he said: There can be no peace, for such is the peopleâs will. He
 58835	alone during the retreat of the French said that all our maneuvers are
 58836	useless, everything is being accomplished of itself better than we could
 58837	desire; that the enemy must be offered âa golden bridgeâ; that neither
 58838	the TarÃºtino, the VyÃ¡zma, nor the KrÃ¡snoe battles were necessary; that
 58839	we must keep some force to reach the frontier with, and that he would
 58840	not sacrifice a single Russian for ten Frenchmen.
 58841	
 58842	And this courtier, as he is described to us, who lies to ArakchÃ©ev
 58843	to please the Emperor, he aloneâincurring thereby the Emperorâs
 58844	displeasureâsaid in VÃ­lna that to carry the war beyond the frontier is
 58845	useless and harmful.
 58846	
 58847	Nor do words alone prove that only he understood the meaning of the
 58848	events. His actionsâwithout the smallest deviationâwere all directed
 58849	to one and the same threefold end: (1) to brace all his strength for
 58850	conflict with the French, (2) to defeat them, and (3) to drive them out
 58851	of Russia, minimizing as far as possible the sufferings of our people
 58852	and of our army.
 58853	
 58854	This procrastinator KutÃºzov, whose motto was âPatience and Time,â
 58855	this enemy of decisive action, gave battle at BorodinÃ³, investing the
 58856	preparations for it with unparalleled solemnity. This KutÃºzov who before
 58857	the battle of Austerlitz began said that it would be lost, he alone, in
 58858	contradiction to everyone else, declared till his death that BorodinÃ³
 58859	was a victory, despite the assurance of generals that the battle was
 58860	lost and despite the fact that for an army to have to retire after
 58861	winning a battle was unprecedented. He alone during the whole retreat
 58862	insisted that battles, which were useless then, should not be fought,
 58863	and that a new war should not be begun nor the frontiers of Russia
 58864	crossed.
 58865	
 58866	It is easy now to understand the significance of these eventsâif only we
 58867	abstain from attributing to the activity of the mass aims that existed
 58868	only in the heads of a dozen individualsâfor the events and results now
 58869	lie before us.
 58870	
 58871	But how did that old man, alone, in opposition to the general opinion,
 58872	so truly discern the importance of the peopleâs view of the events that
 58873	in all his activity he was never once untrue to it?
 58874	
 58875	The source of that extraordinary power of penetrating the meaning of the
 58876	events then occuring lay in the national feeling which he possessed in
 58877	full purity and strength.
 58878	
 58879	Only the recognition of the fact that he possessed this feeling caused
 58880	the people in so strange a manner, contrary to the Tsarâs wish, to
 58881	select himâan old man in disfavorâto be their representative in the
 58882	national war. And only that feeling placed him on that highest human
 58883	pedestal from which he, the commander in chief, devoted all his powers
 58884	not to slaying and destroying men but to saving and showing pity on
 58885	them.
 58886	
 58887	That simple, modest, and therefore truly great, figure could not be
 58888	cast in the false mold of a European heroâthe supposed ruler of menâthat
 58889	history has invented.
 58890	
 58891	To a lackey no man can be great, for a lackey has his own conception of
 58892	greatness.

 58898	CHAPTER VI
 58899	
 58900	The fifth of November was the first day of what is called the battle of
 58901	KrÃ¡snoe. Toward eveningâafter much disputing and many mistakes made by
 58902	generals who did not go to their proper places, and after adjutants had
 58903	been sent about with counterordersâwhen it had become plain that the
 58904	enemy was everywhere in flight and that there could and would be no
 58905	battle, KutÃºzov left KrÃ¡snoe and went to DÃ³broe whither his headquarters
 58906	had that day been transferred.
 58907	
 58908	The day was clear and frosty. KutÃºzov rode to DÃ³broe on his plump little
 58909	white horse, followed by an enormous suite of discontented generals who
 58910	whispered among themselves behind his back. All along the road groups of
 58911	French prisoners captured that day (there were seven thousand of them)
 58912	were crowding to warm themselves at campfires. Near DÃ³broe an immense
 58913	crowd of tattered prisoners, buzzing with talk and wrapped and bandaged
 58914	in anything they had been able to get hold of, were standing in the road
 58915	beside a long row of unharnessed French guns. At the approach of the
 58916	commander in chief the buzz of talk ceased and all eyes were fixed on
 58917	KutÃºzov who, wearing a white cap with a red band and a padded overcoat
 58918	that bulged on his round shoulders, moved slowly along the road on his
 58919	white horse. One of the generals was reporting to him where the guns and
 58920	prisoners had been captured.
 58921	
 58922	KutÃºzov seemed preoccupied and did not listen to what the general was
 58923	saying. He screwed up his eyes with a dissatisfied look as he gazed
 58924	attentively and fixedly at these prisoners, who presented a specially
 58925	wretched appearance. Most of them were disfigured by frost-bitten noses
 58926	and cheeks, and nearly all had red, swollen and festering eyes.
 58927	
 58928	One group of the French stood close to the road, and two of them, one of
 58929	whom had his face covered with sores, were tearing a piece of raw
 58930	flesh with their hands. There was something horrible and bestial in
 58931	the fleeting glance they threw at the riders and in the malevolent
 58932	expression with which, after a glance at KutÃºzov, the soldier with the
 58933	sores immediately turned away and went on with what he was doing.
 58934	
 58935	KutÃºzov looked long and intently at these two soldiers. He puckered his
 58936	face, screwed up his eyes, and pensively swayed his head. At another
 58937	spot he noticed a Russian soldier laughingly patting a Frenchman on the
 58938	shoulder, saying something to him in a friendly manner, and KutÃºzov with
 58939	the same expression on his face again swayed his head.
 58940	
 58941	âWhat were you saying?â he asked the general, who continuing his report
 58942	directed the commander in chiefâs attention to some standards captured
 58943	from the French and standing in front of the PreobrazhÃ©nsk regiment.
 58944	
 58945	âAh, the standards!â said KutÃºzov, evidently detaching himself with
 58946	difficulty from the thoughts that preoccupied him.
 58947	
 58948	He looked about him absently. Thousands of eyes were looking at him from
 58949	all sides awaiting a word from him.
 58950	
 58951	He stopped in front of the PreobrazhÃ©nsk regiment, sighed deeply, and
 58952	closed his eyes. One of his suite beckoned to the soldiers carrying
 58953	the standards to advance and surround the commander in chief with them.
 58954	KutÃºzov was silent for a few seconds and then, submitting with evident
 58955	reluctance to the duty imposed by his position, raised his head
 58956	and began to speak. A throng of officers surrounded him. He looked
 58957	attentively around at the circle of officers, recognizing several of
 58958	them.
 58959	
 58960	âI thank you all!â he said, addressing the soldiers and then again the
 58961	officers. In the stillness around him his slowly uttered words were
 58962	distinctly heard. âI thank you all for your hard and faithful service.
 58963	The victory is complete and Russia will not forget you! Honor to you
 58964	forever.â
 58965	
 58966	He paused and looked around.
 58967	
 58968	âLower its head, lower it!â he said to a soldier who had accidentally
 58969	lowered the French eagle he was holding before the PreobrazhÃ©nsk
 58970	standards. âLower, lower, thatâs it. Hurrah lads!â he added, addressing
 58971	the men with a rapid movement of his chin.
 58972	
 58973	âHur-r-rah!â roared thousands of voices.
 58974	
 58975	While the soldiers were shouting KutÃºzov leaned forward in his saddle
 58976	and bowed his head, and his eye lit up with a mild and apparently ironic
 58977	gleam.
 58978	
 58979	âYou see, brothers...â said he when the shouts had ceased... and all at
 58980	once his voice and the expression of his face changed. It was no longer
 58981	the commander in chief speaking but an ordinary old man who wanted to
 58982	tell his comrades something very important.
 58983	
 58984	There was a stir among the throng of officers and in the ranks of the
 58985	soldiers, who moved that they might hear better what he was going to
 58986	say.
 58987	
 58988	âYou see, brothers, I know itâs hard for you, but it canât be helped!
 58989	Bear up; it wonât be for long now! Weâll see our visitors off and then
 58990	weâll rest. The Tsar wonât forget your service. It is hard for you, but
 58991	still you are at home while theyâyou see what they have come to,â said
 58992	he, pointing to the prisoners. âWorse off than our poorest beggars.
 58993	While they were strong we didnât spare ourselves, but now we may even
 58994	pity them. They are human beings too. Isnât it so, lads?â
 58995	
 58996	He looked around, and in the direct, respectful, wondering gaze fixed
 58997	upon him he read sympathy with what he had said. His face grew brighter
 58998	and brighter with an old manâs mild smile, which drew the corners of his
 58999	lips and eyes into a cluster of wrinkles. He ceased speaking and bowed
 59000	his head as if in perplexity.
 59001	
 59002	âBut after all who asked them here? Serves them right, the bloody
 59003	bastards!â he cried, suddenly lifting his head.
 59004	
 59005	And flourishing his whip he rode off at a gallop for the first time
 59006	during the whole campaign, and left the broken ranks of the soldiers
 59007	laughing joyfully and shouting âHurrah!â
 59008	
 59009	KutÃºzovâs words were hardly understood by the troops. No one could have
 59010	repeated the field marshalâs address, begun solemnly and then changing
 59011	into an old manâs simplehearted talk; but the hearty sincerity of that
 59012	speech, the feeling of majestic triumph combined with pity for the foe
 59013	and consciousness of the justice of our cause, exactly expressed by that
 59014	old manâs good-natured expletives, was not merely understood but lay
 59015	in the soul of every soldier and found expression in their joyous and
 59016	long-sustained shouts. Afterwards when one of the generals addressed
 59017	KutÃºzov asking whether he wished his calÃ¨che to be sent for, KutÃºzov in
 59018	answering unexpectedly gave a sob, being evidently greatly moved.
 59019	
 59020	
 59021	
 59022	
 59023	
 59024	CHAPTER VII
 59025	
 59026	When the troops reached their nightâs halting place on the eighth of
 59027	November, the last day of the KrÃ¡snoe battles, it was already growing
 59028	dusk. All day it had been calm and frosty with occasional lightly
 59029	falling snow and toward evening it began to clear. Through the falling
 59030	snow a purple-black and starry sky showed itself and the frost grew
 59031	keener.
 59032	
 59033	An infantry regiment which had left TarÃºtino three thousand strong but
 59034	now numbered only nine hundred was one of the first to arrive that night
 59035	at its halting placeâa village on the highroad. The quartermasters who
 59036	met the regiment announced that all the huts were full of sick and dead
 59037	Frenchmen, cavalrymen, and members of the staff. There was only one hut
 59038	available for the regimental commander.
 59039	
 59040	The commander rode up to his hut. The regiment passed through the
 59041	village and stacked its arms in front of the last huts.
 59042	
 59043	Like some huge many-limbed animal, the regiment began to prepare its
 59044	lair and its food. One part of it dispersed and waded knee-deep
 59045	through the snow into a birch forest to the right of the village, and
 59046	immediately the sound of axes and swords, the crashing of branches,
 59047	and merry voices could be heard from there. Another section amid the
 59048	regimental wagons and horses which were standing in a group was busy
 59049	getting out caldrons and rye biscuit, and feeding the horses. A third
 59050	section scattered through the village arranging quarters for the staff
 59051	officers, carrying out the French corpses that were in the huts, and
 59052	dragging away boards, dry wood, and thatch from the roofs, for the
 59053	campfires, or wattle fences to serve for shelter.
 59054	
 59055	Some fifteen men with merry shouts were shaking down the high wattle
 59056	wall of a shed, the roof of which had already been removed.
 59057	
 59058	âNow then, all togetherâshove!â cried the voices, and the huge surface
 59059	of the wall, sprinkled with snow and creaking with frost, was seen
 59060	swaying in the gloom of the night. The lower stakes cracked more and
 59061	more and at last the wall fell, and with it the men who had been pushing
 59062	it. Loud, coarse laughter and joyous shouts ensued.
 59063	
 59064	âNow then, catch hold in twos! Hand up the lever! Thatâs it.... Where
 59065	are you shoving to?â
 59066	
 59067	âNow, all together! But wait a moment, boys... With a song!â
 59068	
 59069	All stood silent, and a soft, pleasant velvety voice began to sing. At
 59070	the end of the third verse as the last note died away, twenty voices
 59071	roared out at once: âOo-oo-oo-oo! Thatâs it. All together! Heave away,
 59072	boys!...â but despite their united efforts the wattle hardly moved, and
 59073	in the silence that followed the heavy breathing of the men was audible.
 59074	
 59075	âHere, you of the Sixth Company! Devils that you are! Lend a hand...
 59076	will you? You may want us one of these days.â
 59077	
 59078	Some twenty men of the Sixth Company who were on their way into the
 59079	village joined the haulers, and the wattle wall, which was about
 59080	thirty-five feet long and seven feet high, moved forward along the
 59081	village street, swaying, pressing upon and cutting the shoulders of the
 59082	gasping men.
 59083	
 59084	âGet along... Falling? What are you stopping for? There now....â
 59085	
 59086	Merry senseless words of abuse flowed freely.
 59087	
 59088	âWhat are you up to?â suddenly came the authoritative voice of a
 59089	sergeant major who came upon the men who were hauling their burden.
 59090	âThere are gentry here; the general himself is in that hut, and you
 59091	foul-mouthed devils, you brutes, Iâll give it to you!â shouted he,
 59092	hitting the first man who came in his way a swinging blow on the back.
 59093	âCanât you make less noise?â
 59094	
 59095	The men became silent. The soldier who had been struck groaned and wiped
 59096	his face, which had been scratched till it bled by his falling against
 59097	the wattle.
 59098	
 59099	âThere, how that devil hits out! Heâs made my face all bloody,â said he
 59100	in a frightened whisper when the sergeant major had passed on.
 59101	
 59102	âDonât you like it?â said a laughing voice, and moderating their tones
 59103	the men moved forward.
 59104	
 59105	When they were out of the village they began talking again as loud as
 59106	before, interlarding their talk with the same aimless expletives.
 59107	
 59108	In the hut which the men had passed, the chief officers had gathered and
 59109	were in animated talk over their tea about the events of the day and the
 59110	maneuvers suggested for tomorrow. It was proposed to make a flank march
 59111	to the left, cut off the Vice-King (Murat) and capture him.
 59112	
 59113	By the time the soldiers had dragged the wattle fence to its place
 59114	the campfires were blazing on all sides ready for cooking, the wood
 59115	crackled, the snow was melting, and black shadows of soldiers flitted
 59116	to and fro all over the occupied space where the snow had been trodden
 59117	down.
 59118	
 59119	Axes and choppers were plied all around. Everything was done without any
 59120	orders being given. Stores of wood were brought for the night, shelters
 59121	were rigged up for the officers, caldrons were being boiled, and muskets
 59122	and accouterments put in order.
 59123	
 59124	The wattle wall the men had brought was set up in a semicircle by the
 59125	Eighth Company as a shelter from the north, propped up by musket rests,
 59126	and a campfire was built before it. They beat the tattoo, called the
 59127	roll, had supper, and settled down round the fires for the nightâsome
 59128	repairing their footgear, some smoking pipes, and some stripping
 59129	themselves naked to steam the lice out of their shirts.
 59130

 59134	
 59135	CHAPTER VIII
 59136	
 59137	One would have thought that under the almost incredibly wretched
 59138	conditions the Russian soldiers were in at that timeâlacking warm boots
 59139	and sheepskin coats, without a roof over their heads, in the snow
 59140	with eighteen degrees of frost, and without even full rations (the
 59141	commissariat did not always keep up with the troops)âthey would have
 59142	presented a very sad and depressing spectacle.
 59143	
 59144	On the contrary, the army had never under the best material conditions
 59145	presented a more cheerful and animated aspect. This was because all who
 59146	began to grow depressed or who lost strength were sifted out of the army
 59147	day by day. All the physically or morally weak had long since been left
 59148	behind and only the flower of the armyâphysically and mentallyâremained.
 59149	
 59150	More men collected behind the wattle fence of the Eighth Company than
 59151	anywhere else. Two sergeants major were sitting with them and their
 59152	campfire blazed brighter than others. For leave to sit by their wattle
 59153	they demanded contributions of fuel.
 59154	
 59155	âEh, MakÃ©ev! What has become of you, you son of a bitch? Are you lost or
 59156	have the wolves eaten you? Fetch some more wood!â shouted a red-haired
 59157	and red-faced man, screwing up his eyes and blinking because of the
 59158	smoke but not moving back from the fire. âAnd you, Jackdaw, go and fetch
 59159	some wood!â said he to another soldier.
 59160	
 59161	This red-haired man was neither a sergeant nor a corporal, but being
 59162	robust he ordered about those weaker than himself. The soldier
 59163	they called âJackdaw,â a thin little fellow with a sharp nose, rose
 59164	obediently and was about to go but at that instant there came into
 59165	the light of the fire the slender, handsome figure of a young soldier
 59166	carrying a load of wood.
 59167	
 59168	âBring it hereâthatâs fine!â
 59169	
 59170	They split up the wood, pressed it down on the fire, blew at it with
 59171	their mouths, and fanned it with the skirts of their greatcoats, making
 59172	the flames hiss and crackle. The men drew nearer and lit their pipes.
 59173	The handsome young soldier who had brought the wood, setting his arms
 59174	akimbo, began stamping his cold feet rapidly and deftly on the spot
 59175	where he stood.
 59176	
 59177	âMother! The dew is cold but clear.... Itâs well that Iâm a
 59178	musketeer...â he sang, pretending to hiccough after each syllable.
 59179	
 59180	âLook out, your soles will fly off!â shouted the red-haired man,
 59181	noticing that the sole of the dancerâs boot was hanging loose. âWhat a
 59182	fellow you are for dancing!â
 59183	
 59184	The dancer stopped, pulled off the loose piece of leather, and threw it
 59185	on the fire.
 59186	
 59187	âRight enough, friend,â said he, and, having sat down, took out of his
 59188	knapsack a scrap of blue French cloth, and wrapped it round his foot.
 59189	âItâs the steam that spoils them,â he added, stretching out his feet
 59190	toward the fire.
 59191	
 59192	âTheyâll soon be issuing us new ones. They say that when weâve finished
 59193	hammering them, weâre to receive double kits!â
 59194	
 59195	âAnd that son of a bitch PetrÃ³v has lagged behind after all, it seems,â
 59196	said one sergeant major.
 59197	
 59198	âIâve had an eye on him this long while,â said the other.
 59199	
 59200	âWell, heâs a poor sort of soldier....â
 59201	
 59202	âBut in the Third Company they say nine men were missing yesterday.â
 59203	
 59204	âYes, itâs all very well, but when a manâs feet are frozen how can he
 59205	walk?â
 59206	
 59207	âEh? Donât talk nonsense!â said a sergeant major.
 59208	
 59209	âDo you want to be doing the same?â said an old soldier, turning
 59210	reproachfully to the man who had spoken of frozen feet.
 59211	
 59212	âWell, you know,â said the sharp-nosed man they called Jackdaw in a
 59213	squeaky and unsteady voice, raising himself at the other side of the
 59214	fire, âa plump man gets thin, but for a thin one itâs death. Take
 59215	me, now! Iâve got no strength left,â he added, with sudden resolution
 59216	turning to the sergeant major. âTell them to send me to hospital; Iâm
 59217	aching all over; anyway I shanât be able to keep up.â
 59218	
 59219	âThatâll do, thatâll do!â replied the sergeant major quietly.
 59220	
 59221	The soldier said no more and the talk went on.
 59222	
 59223	âWhat a lot of those Frenchies were taken today, and the fact is that
 59224	not one of them had what you might call real boots on,â said a soldier,
 59225	starting a new theme. âThey were no more than make-believes.â
 59226	
 59227	âThe Cossacks have taken their boots. They were clearing the hut for the
 59228	colonel and carried them out. It was pitiful to see them, boys,â put in
 59229	the dancer. âAs they turned them over one seemed still alive and, would
 59230	you believe it, he jabbered something in their lingo.â
 59231	
 59232	âBut theyâre a clean folk, lads,â the first man went on; âhe was
 59233	whiteâas white as birchbarkâand some of them are such fine fellows, you
 59234	might think they were nobles.â
 59235	
 59236	âWell, what do you think? They make soldiers of all classes there.â
 59237	
 59238	âBut they donât understand our talk at all,â said the dancer with a
 59239	puzzled smile. âI asked him whose subject he was, and he jabbered in his
 59240	own way. A queer lot!â
 59241	
 59242	âBut itâs strange, friends,â continued the man who had wondered at their
 59243	whiteness, âthe peasants at MozhÃ¡ysk were saying that when they began
 59244	burying the deadâwhere the battle was you knowâwell, those dead had been
 59245	lying there for nearly a month, and says the peasant, âthey lie as white
 59246	as paper, clean, and not as much smell as a puff of powder smoke.ââ
 59247	
 59248	âWas it from the cold?â asked someone.
 59249	
 59250	âYouâre a clever fellow! From the cold indeed! Why, it was hot. If it
 59251	had been from the cold, ours would not have rotted either. âBut,â he
 59252	says, âgo up to ours and they are all rotten and maggoty. So,â he says,
 59253	âwe tie our faces up with kerchiefs and turn our heads away as we drag
 59254	them off: we can hardly do it. But theirs,â he says, âare white as paper
 59255	and not so much smell as a whiff of gunpowder.ââ
 59256	
 59257	All were silent.
 59258	
 59259	âIt must be from their food,â said the sergeant major. âThey used to
 59260	gobble the same food as the gentry.â
 59261	
 59262	No one contradicted him.
 59263	
 59264	âThat peasant near MozhÃ¡ysk where the battle was said the men were all
 59265	called up from ten villages around and they carted for twenty days and
 59266	still didnât finish carting the dead away. And as for the wolves, he
 59267	says...â
 59268	
 59269	âThat was a real battle,â said an old soldier. âItâs the only one worth
 59270	remembering; but since that... itâs only been tormenting folk.â
 59271	
 59272	âAnd do you know, Daddy, the day before yesterday we ran at them and,
 59273	my word, they didnât let us get near before they just threw down their
 59274	muskets and went on their knees. âPardon!â they say. Thatâs only one
 59275	case. They say PlÃ¡tov took âPoleon himself twice. But he didnât know
 59276	the right charm. He catches him and catches himâno good! He turns into
 59277	a bird in his hands and flies away. And thereâs no way of killing him
 59278	either.â
 59279	
 59280	âYouâre a first-class liar, KiselÃ«v, when I come to look at you!â
 59281	
 59282	âLiar, indeed! Itâs the real truth.â
 59283	
 59284	âIf he fell into my hands, when Iâd caught him Iâd bury him in the
 59285	ground with an aspen stake to fix him down. What a lot of men heâs
 59286	ruined!â
 59287	
 59288	âWell, anyhow weâre going to end it. He wonât come here again,â remarked
 59289	the old soldier, yawning.
 59290	
 59291	The conversation flagged, and the soldiers began settling down to sleep.
 59292	
 59293	âLook at the stars. Itâs wonderful how they shine! You would think the
 59294	women had spread out their linen,â said one of the men, gazing with
 59295	admiration at the Milky Way.
 59296	
 59297	âThatâs a sign of a good harvest next year.â
 59298	
 59299	âWe shall want some more wood.â
 59300	
 59301	âYou warm your back and your belly gets frozen. Thatâs queer.â
 59302	
 59303	âO Lord!â
 59304	
 59305	âWhat are you pushing for? Is the fire only for you? Look how heâs
 59306	sprawling!â
 59307	
 59308	In the silence that ensued, the snoring of those who had fallen asleep
 59309	could be heard. Others turned over and warmed themselves, now and again
 59310	exchanging a few words. From a campfire a hundred paces off came a sound
 59311	of general, merry laughter.
 59312	
 59313	âHark at them roaring there in the Fifth Company!â said one of the
 59314	soldiers, âand what a lot of them there are!â
 59315	
 59316	One of the men got up and went over to the Fifth Company.
 59317	
 59318	âTheyâre having such fun,â said he, coming back. âTwo Frenchies have
 59319	turned up. Oneâs quite frozen and the otherâs an awful swaggerer. Heâs
 59320	singing songs....â
 59321	
 59322	âOh, Iâll go across and have a look....â
 59323	
 59324	And several of the men went over to the Fifth Company.
 59325	
 59326	
 59327	
 59328	
 59329	
 59330	CHAPTER IX
 59331	
 59332	The fifth company was bivouacking at the very edge of the forest. A huge
 59333	campfire was blazing brightly in the midst of the snow, lighting up the
 59334	branches of trees heavy with hoarfrost.
 59335	
 59336	About midnight they heard the sound of steps in the snow of the forest,
 59337	and the crackling of dry branches.
 59338	
 59339	âA bear, lads,â said one of the men.
 59340	
 59341	They all raised their heads to listen, and out of the forest into the
 59342	bright firelight stepped two strangely clad human figures clinging to
 59343	one another.
 59344	
 59345	These were two Frenchmen who had been hiding in the forest. They came up
 59346	to the fire, hoarsely uttering something in a language our soldiers did
 59347	not understand. One was taller than the other; he wore an officerâs hat
 59348	and seemed quite exhausted. On approaching the fire he had been going to
 59349	sit down, but fell. The other, a short sturdy soldier with a shawl
 59350	tied round his head, was stronger. He raised his companion and said
 59351	something, pointing to his mouth. The soldiers surrounded the Frenchmen,
 59352	spread a greatcoat on the ground for the sick man, and brought some
 59353	buckwheat porridge and vodka for both of them.
 59354	
 59355	The exhausted French officer was Ramballe and the man with his head
 59356	wrapped in the shawl was Morel, his orderly.
 59357	
 59358	When Morel had drunk some vodka and finished his bowl of porridge he
 59359	suddenly became unnaturally merry and chattered incessantly to the
 59360	soldiers, who could not understand him. Ramballe refused food and
 59361	resting his head on his elbow lay silent beside the campfire, looking at
 59362	the Russian soldiers with red and vacant eyes. Occasionally he emitted
 59363	a long-drawn groan and then again became silent. Morel, pointing to his
 59364	shoulders, tried to impress on the soldiers the fact that Ramballe was
 59365	an officer and ought to be warmed. A Russian officer who had come up
 59366	to the fire sent to ask his colonel whether he would not take a French
 59367	officer into his hut to warm him, and when the messenger returned and
 59368	said that the colonel wished the officer to be brought to him, Ramballe
 59369	was told to go. He rose and tried to walk, but staggered and would have
 59370	fallen had not a soldier standing by held him up.
 59371	
 59372	âYou wonât do it again, eh?â said one of the soldiers, winking and
 59373	turning mockingly to Ramballe.
 59374	
 59375	âOh, you fool! Why talk rubbish, lout that you areâa real peasant!â came
 59376	rebukes from all sides addressed to the jesting soldier.
 59377	
 59378	They surrounded Ramballe, lifted him on the crossed arms of two
 59379	soldiers, and carried him to the hut. Ramballe put his arms around their
 59380	necks while they carried him and began wailing plaintively:
 59381	
 59382	âOh, you fine fellows, my kind, kind friends! These are men! Oh, my
 59383	brave, kind friends,â and he leaned his head against the shoulder of one
 59384	of the men like a child.
 59385	
 59386	Meanwhile Morel was sitting in the best place by the fire, surrounded by
 59387	the soldiers.
 59388	
 59389	Morel, a short sturdy Frenchman with inflamed and streaming eyes, was
 59390	wearing a womanâs cloak and had a shawl tied woman fashion round his
 59391	head over his cap. He was evidently tipsy, and was singing a French song
 59392	in a hoarse broken voice, with an arm thrown round the nearest soldier.
 59393	The soldiers simply held their sides as they watched him.
 59394	
 59395	âNow then, now then, teach us how it goes! Iâll soon pick it up. How is
 59396	it?â said the manâa singer and a wagâwhom Morel was embracing.
 59397	
 59398	âVive Henri Quatre! Vive ce roi valiant!â sang Morel, winking. âCe
 59399	diable Ã  quatre...â *
 59400	
 59401	     * âLong live Henry the Fourth, that valiant king! That rowdy
 59402	     devil.â
 59403	
 59404	
 59405	âVivarika! Vif-seruvaru! Sedyablyaka!â repeated the soldier, flourishing
 59406	his arm and really catching the tune.
 59407	
 59408	âBravo! Ha, ha, ha!â rose their rough, joyous laughter from all sides.
 59409	
 59410	Morel, wrinkling up his face, laughed too.
 59411	
 59412	âWell, go on, go on!â
 59413	
 59414	    âQui eut le triple talent,
 59415	    De boire, de battre,
 59416	    Et dâÃªtre un vert galant.â *
 59417	
 59418	      * Who had a triple talent
 59419	      For drinking, for fighting,
 59420	      And for being a gallant old boy...
 59421	
 59422	âIt goes smoothly, too. Well, now, ZaletÃ¡ev!â
 59423	
 59424	âKe...â ZaletÃ¡ev, brought out with effort: âke-e-e-e,â he drawled,
 59425	laboriously pursing his lips, âle-trip-ta-la-de-bu-de-ba, e
 59426	de-tra-va-ga-laâ he sang.
 59427	
 59428	âFine! Just like the Frenchie! Oh, ho ho! Do you want some more to eat?â
 59429	
 59430	âGive him some porridge: it takes a long time to get filled up after
 59431	starving.â
 59432	
 59433	They gave him some more porridge and Morel with a laugh set to work on
 59434	his third bowl. All the young soldiers smiled gaily as they watched him.
 59435	The older men, who thought it undignified to amuse themselves with such
 59436	nonsense, continued to lie at the opposite side of the fire, but one
 59437	would occasionally raise himself on an elbow and glance at Morel with a
 59438	smile.
 59439	
 59440	âThey are men too,â said one of them as he wrapped himself up in his
 59441	coat. âEven wormwood grows on its own root.â
 59442	
 59443	âO Lord, O Lord! How starry it is! Tremendous! That means a hard
 59444	frost....â
 59445	
 59446	They all grew silent. The stars, as if knowing that no one was looking
 59447	at them, began to disport themselves in the dark sky: now flaring
 59448	up, now vanishing, now trembling, they were busy whispering something
 59449	gladsome and mysterious to one another.
 59450	
 59451	
 59452	
 59453	
 59454	
 59455	CHAPTER X
 59456	
 59457	The French army melted away at the uniform rate of a mathematical
 59458	progression; and that crossing of the BerÃ«zina about which so much has
 59459	been written was only one intermediate stage in its destruction, and
 59460	not at all the decisive episode of the campaign. If so much has been
 59461	and still is written about the BerÃ«zina, on the French side this is only
 59462	because at the broken bridge across that river the calamities their army
 59463	had been previously enduring were suddenly concentrated at one moment
 59464	into a tragic spectacle that remained in every memory, and on the
 59465	Russian side merely because in Petersburgâfar from the seat of warâa
 59466	plan (again one of Pfuelâs) had been devised to catch Napoleon in a
 59467	strategic trap at the BerÃ«zina River. Everyone assured himself that all
 59468	would happen according to plan, and therefore insisted that it was just
 59469	the crossing of the BerÃ«zina that destroyed the French army. In reality
 59470	the results of the crossing were much less disastrous to the Frenchâin
 59471	guns and men lostâthan KrÃ¡snoe had been, as the figures show.
 59472	
 59473	The sole importance of the crossing of the BerÃ«zina lies in the fact
 59474	that it plainly and indubitably proved the fallacy of all the plans for
 59475	cutting off the enemyâs retreat and the soundness of the only possible
 59476	line of actionâthe one KutÃºzov and the general mass of the army
 59477	demandedânamely, simply to follow the enemy up. The French crowd fled
 59478	at a continually increasing speed and all its energy was directed to
 59479	reaching its goal. It fled like a wounded animal and it was impossible
 59480	to block its path. This was shown not so much by the arrangements it
 59481	made for crossing as by what took place at the bridges. When the bridges
 59482	broke down, unarmed soldiers, people from Moscow and women with
 59483	children who were with the French transport, allâcarried on by vis
 59484	inertiÃ¦âpressed forward into boats and into the ice-covered water and
 59485	did not surrender.
 59486	
 59487	That impulse was reasonable. The condition of fugitives and of pursuers
 59488	was equally bad. As long as they remained with their own people each
 59489	might hope for help from his fellows and the definite place he held
 59490	among them. But those who surrendered, while remaining in the same
 59491	pitiful plight, would be on a lower level to claim a share in the
 59492	necessities of life. The French did not need to be informed of the fact
 59493	that half the prisonersâwith whom the Russians did not know what to
 59494	doâperished of cold and hunger despite their captorsâ desire to save
 59495	them; they felt that it could not be otherwise. The most compassionate
 59496	Russian commanders, those favorable to the Frenchâand even the Frenchmen
 59497	in the Russian serviceâcould do nothing for the prisoners. The French
 59498	perished from the conditions to which the Russian army was itself
 59499	exposed. It was impossible to take bread and clothes from our hungry and
 59500	indispensable soldiers to give to the French who, though not harmful, or
 59501	hated, or guilty, were simply unnecessary. Some Russians even did that,
 59502	but they were exceptions.
 59503	
 59504	Certain destruction lay behind the French but in front there was hope.
 59505	Their ships had been burned, there was no salvation save in collective
 59506	flight, and on that the whole strength of the French was concentrated.
 59507	
 59508	The farther they fled the more wretched became the plight of the
 59509	remnant, especially after the BerÃ«zina, on which (in consequence of the
 59510	Petersburg plan) special hopes had been placed by the Russians, and
 59511	the keener grew the passions of the Russian commanders, who blamed one
 59512	another and KutÃºzov most of all. Anticipation that the failure of
 59513	the Petersburg BerÃ«zina plan would be attributed to KutÃºzov led
 59514	to dissatisfaction, contempt, and ridicule, more and more strongly
 59515	expressed. The ridicule and contempt were of course expressed in a
 59516	respectful form, making it impossible for him to ask wherein he was
 59517	to blame. They did not talk seriously to him; when reporting to him or
 59518	asking for his sanction they appeared to be fulfilling a regrettable
 59519	formality, but they winked behind his back and tried to mislead him at
 59520	every turn.
 59521	
 59522	Because they could not understand him all these people assumed that
 59523	it was useless to talk to the old man; that he would never grasp the
 59524	profundity of their plans, that he would answer with his phrases (which
 59525	they thought were mere phrases) about a âgolden bridge,â about the
 59526	impossibility of crossing the frontier with a crowd of tatterdemalions,
 59527	and so forth. They had heard all that before. And all he saidâthat it
 59528	was necessary to await provisions, or that the men had no bootsâwas so
 59529	simple, while what they proposed was so complicated and clever, that
 59530	it was evident that he was old and stupid and that they, though not in
 59531	power, were commanders of genius.
 59532	
 59533	After the junction with the army of the brilliant admiral and Petersburg
 59534	hero Wittgenstein, this mood and the gossip of the staff reached their
 59535	maximum. KutÃºzov saw this and merely sighed and shrugged his shoulders.
 59536	Only once, after the affair of the BerÃ«zina, did he get angry and write
 59537	to Bennigsen (who reported separately to the Emperor) the following
 59538	letter:
 59539	
 59540	âOn account of your spells of ill health, will your excellency please
 59541	be so good as to set off for KalÃºga on receipt of this, and there await
 59542	further commands and appointments from His Imperial Majesty.â
 59543	
 59544	But after Bennigsenâs departure, the Grand Duke TsarÃ©vich Constantine
 59545	PÃ¡vlovich joined the army. He had taken part in the beginning of the
 59546	campaign but had subsequently been removed from the army by KutÃºzov.
 59547	Now having come to the army, he informed KutÃºzov of the Emperorâs
 59548	displeasure at the poor success of our forces and the slowness of their
 59549	advance. The Emperor intended to join the army personally in a few daysâ
 59550	time.
 59551	
 59552	The old man, experienced in court as well as in military affairsâthis
 59553	same KutÃºzov who in August had been chosen commander in chief
 59554	against the sovereignâs wishes and who had removed the Grand Duke and
 59555	heir-apparent from the armyâwho on his own authority and contrary to the
 59556	Emperorâs will had decided on the abandonment of Moscow, now realized at
 59557	once that his day was over, that his part was played, and that the power
 59558	he was supposed to hold was no longer his. And he understood this not
 59559	merely from the attitude of the court. He saw on the one hand that the
 59560	military business in which he had played his part was ended and felt
 59561	that his mission was accomplished; and at the same time he began to
 59562	be conscious of the physical weariness of his aged body and of the
 59563	necessity of physical rest.
 59564	
 59565	On the twenty-ninth of November KutÃºzov entered VÃ­lnaâhis âdear VÃ­lnaâ
 59566	as he called it. Twice during his career KutÃºzov had been governor of
 59567	VÃ­lna. In that wealthy town, which had not been injured, he found old
 59568	friends and associations, besides the comforts of life of which he had
 59569	so long been deprived. And he suddenly turned from the cares of army
 59570	and state and, as far as the passions that seethed around him allowed,
 59571	immersed himself in the quiet life to which he had formerly been
 59572	accustomed, as if all that was taking place and all that had still to be
 59573	done in the realm of history did not concern him at all.
 59574	
 59575	ChichagÃ³v, one of the most zealous âcutters-offâ and âbreakers-up,â who
 59576	had first wanted to effect a diversion in Greece and then in Warsaw but
 59577	never wished to go where he was sent: ChichagÃ³v, noted for the boldness
 59578	with which he spoke to the Emperor, and who considered KutÃºzov to be
 59579	under an obligation to him because when he was sent to make peace
 59580	with Turkey in 1811 independently of KutÃºzov, and found that peace had
 59581	already been concluded, he admitted to the Emperor that the merit of
 59582	securing that peace was really KutÃºzovâs; this ChichagÃ³v was the first
 59583	to meet KutÃºzov at the castle where the latter was to stay. In undress
 59584	naval uniform, with a dirk, and holding his cap under his arm, he handed
 59585	KutÃºzov a garrison report and the keys of the town. The contemptuously
 59586	respectful attitude of the younger men to the old man in his dotage was
 59587	expressed in the highest degree by the behavior of ChichagÃ³v, who knew
 59588	of the accusations that were being directed against KutÃºzov.
 59589	
 59590	When speaking to ChichagÃ³v, KutÃºzov incidentally mentioned that the
 59591	vehicles packed with china that had been captured from him at BorÃ­sov
 59592	had been recovered and would be restored to him.
 59593	
 59594	âYou mean to imply that I have nothing to eat out of.... On the
 59595	contrary, I can supply you with everything even if you want to give
 59596	dinner parties,â warmly replied ChichagÃ³v, who tried by every word he
 59597	spoke to prove his own rectitude and therefore imagined KutÃºzov to be
 59598	animated by the same desire.
 59599	
 59600	KutÃºzov, shrugging his shoulders, replied with his subtle penetrating
 59601	smile: âI meant merely to say what I said.â
 59602	
 59603	Contrary to the Emperorâs wish KutÃºzov detained the greater part of the
 59604	army at VÃ­lna. Those about him said that he became extraordinarily slack
 59605	and physically feeble during his stay in that town. He attended to army
 59606	affairs reluctantly, left everything to his generals, and while awaiting
 59607	the Emperorâs arrival led a dissipated life.
 59608	
 59609	Having left Petersburg on the seventh of December with his suiteâCount
 59610	TolstÃ³y, Prince VolkÃ³nski, ArakchÃ©ev, and othersâthe Emperor reached
 59611	VÃ­lna on the eleventh, and in his traveling sleigh drove straight to
 59612	the castle. In spite of the severe frost some hundred generals and staff
 59613	officers in full parade uniform stood in front of the castle, as well as
 59614	a guard of honor of the SemÃ«nov regiment.
 59615	
 59616	A courier who galloped to the castle in advance, in a troyka with three
 59617	foam-flecked horses, shouted âComing!â and KonovnÃ­tsyn rushed into the
 59618	vestibule to inform KutÃºzov, who was waiting in the hall porterâs little
 59619	lodge.
 59620	
 59621	A minute later the old manâs large stout figure in full-dress uniform,
 59622	his chest covered with orders and a scarf drawn round his stomach,
 59623	waddled out into the porch. He put on his hat with its peaks to the
 59624	sides and, holding his gloves in his hand and walking with an effort
 59625	sideways down the steps to the level of the street, took in his hand the
 59626	report he had prepared for the Emperor.
 59627	
 59628	There was running to and fro and whispering; another troyka flew
 59629	furiously up, and then all eyes were turned on an approaching sleigh
 59630	in which the figures of the Emperor and VolkÃ³nski could already be
 59631	descried.
 59632	
 59633	From the habit of fifty years all this had a physically agitating effect
 59634	on the old general. He carefully and hastily felt himself all over,
 59635	readjusted his hat, and pulling himself together drew himself up and,
 59636	at the very moment when the Emperor, having alighted from the sleigh,
 59637	lifted his eyes to him, handed him the report and began speaking in his
 59638	smooth, ingratiating voice.
 59639	
 59640	The Emperor with a rapid glance scanned KutÃºzov from head to foot,
 59641	frowned for an instant, but immediately mastering himself went up to the
 59642	old man, extended his arms and embraced him. And this embrace too, owing
 59643	to a long-standing impression related to his innermost feelings, had its
 59644	usual effect on KutÃºzov and he gave a sob.
 59645	
 59646	The Emperor greeted the officers and the SemÃ«nov guard, and again
 59647	pressing the old manâs hand went with him into the castle.
 59648	
 59649	When alone with the field marshal the Emperor expressed his
 59650	dissatisfaction at the slowness of the pursuit and at the mistakes made
 59651	at KrÃ¡snoe and the BerÃ«zina, and informed him of his intentions for a
 59652	future campaign abroad. KutÃºzov made no rejoinder or remark. The same
 59653	submissive, expressionless look with which he had listened to the
 59654	Emperorâs commands on the field of Austerlitz seven years before settled
 59655	on his face now.
 59656	
 59657	When KutÃºzov came out of the study and with lowered head was crossing
 59658	the ballroom with his heavy waddling gait, he was arrested by someoneâs
 59659	voice saying:
 59660	
 59661	âYour Serene Highness!â
 59662	
 59663	KutÃºzov raised his head and looked for a long while into the eyes of
 59664	Count TolstÃ³y, who stood before him holding a silver salver on which lay
 59665	a small object. KutÃºzov seemed not to understand what was expected of
 59666	him.
 59667	
 59668	Suddenly he seemed to remember; a scarcely perceptible smile flashed
 59669	across his puffy face, and bowing low and respectfully he took the
 59670	object that lay on the salver. It was the Order of St. George of the
 59671	First Class.
 59672	
 59673	
 59674	
 59675	
 59676	
 59677	CHAPTER XI
 59678	
 59679	Next day the field marshal gave a dinner and ball which the Emperor
 59680	honored by his presence. KutÃºzov had received the Order of St. George
 59681	of the First Class and the Emperor showed him the highest honors, but
 59682	everyone knew of the imperial dissatisfaction with him. The proprieties
 59683	were observed and the Emperor was the first to set that example,
 59684	but everybody understood that the old man was blameworthy and
 59685	good-for-nothing. When KutÃºzov, conforming to a custom of Catherineâs
 59686	day, ordered the standards that had been captured to be lowered at the
 59687	Emperorâs feet on his entering the ballroom, the Emperor made a wry face
 59688	and muttered something in which some people caught the words, âthe old
 59689	comedian.â
 59690	
 59691	The Emperorâs displeasure with KutÃºzov was specially increased at VÃ­lna
 59692	by the fact that KutÃºzov evidently could not or would not understand the
 59693	importance of the coming campaign.
 59694	
 59695	When on the following morning the Emperor said to the officers assembled
 59696	about him: âYou have not only saved Russia, you have saved Europe!â they
 59697	all understood that the war was not ended.
 59698	
 59699	KutÃºzov alone would not see this and openly expressed his opinion that
 59700	no fresh war could improve the position or add to the glory of Russia,
 59701	but could only spoil and lower the glorious position that Russia had
 59702	gained. He tried to prove to the Emperor the impossibility of levying
 59703	fresh troops, spoke of the hardships already endured by the people, of
 59704	the possibility of failure and so forth.
 59705	
 59706	This being the field marshalâs frame of mind he was naturally regarded
 59707	as merely a hindrance and obstacle to the impending war.
 59708	
 59709	To avoid unpleasant encounters with the old man, the natural method was
 59710	to do what had been done with him at Austerlitz and with Barclay at
 59711	the beginning of the Russian campaignâto transfer the authority to the
 59712	Emperor himself, thus cutting the ground from under the commander in
 59713	chiefâs feet without upsetting the old man by informing him of the
 59714	change.
 59715	
 59716	With this object his staff was gradually reconstructed and its real
 59717	strength removed and transferred to the Emperor. Toll, KonovnÃ­tsyn, and
 59718	ErmÃ³lov received fresh appointments. Everyone spoke loudly of the field
 59719	marshalâs great weakness and failing health.
 59720	
 59721	His health had to be bad for his place to be taken away and given to
 59722	another. And in fact his health was poor.
 59723	
 59724	So naturally, simply, and graduallyâjust as he had come from Turkey to
 59725	the Treasury in Petersburg to recruit the militia, and then to the army
 59726	when he was needed thereânow when his part was played out, KutÃºzovâs
 59727	place was taken by a new and necessary performer.
 59728	
 59729	The war of 1812, besides its national significance dear to every Russian
 59730	heart, was now to assume another, a European, significance.
 59731	
 59732	The movement of peoples from west to east was to be succeeded by a
 59733	movement of peoples from east to west, and for this fresh war another
 59734	leader was necessary, having qualities and views differing from
 59735	KutÃºzovâs and animated by different motives.
 59736	
 59737	Alexander I was as necessary for the movement of the peoples from east
 59738	to west and for the refixing of national frontiers as KutÃºzov had been
 59739	for the salvation and glory of Russia.
 59740	
 59741	KutÃºzov did not understand what Europe, the balance of power, or
 59742	Napoleon meant. He could not understand it. For the representative of
 59743	the Russian people, after the enemy had been destroyed and Russia had
 59744	been liberated and raised to the summit of her glory, there was nothing
 59745	left to do as a Russian. Nothing remained for the representative of the
 59746	national war but to die, and KutÃºzov died.
 59747	
 59748	
 59749	
 59750	
 59751	
 59752	CHAPTER XII
 59753	
 59754	As generally happens, Pierre did not feel the full effects of the
 59755	physical privation and strain he had suffered as prisoner until after
 59756	they were over. After his liberation he reached OrÃ«l, and on the third
 59757	day there, when preparing to go to Kiev, he fell ill and was laid up
 59758	for three months. He had what the doctors termed âbilious fever.â But
 59759	despite the fact that the doctors treated him, bled him, and gave him
 59760	medicines to drink, he recovered.
 59761	
 59762	Scarcely any impression was left on Pierreâs mind by all that happened
 59763	to him from the time of his rescue till his illness. He remembered
 59764	only the dull gray weather now rainy and now snowy, internal physical
 59765	distress, and pains in his feet and side. He remembered a general
 59766	impression of the misfortunes and sufferings of people and of being
 59767	worried by the curiosity of officers and generals who questioned him, he
 59768	also remembered his difficulty in procuring a conveyance and horses, and
 59769	above all he remembered his incapacity to think and feel all that time.
 59770	On the day of his rescue he had seen the body of PÃ©tya RostÃ³v. That same
 59771	day he had learned that Prince Andrew, after surviving the battle of
 59772	BorodinÃ³ for more than a month had recently died in the RostÃ³vsâ house
 59773	at YaroslÃ¡vl, and DenÃ­sov who told him this news also mentioned HÃ©lÃ¨neâs
 59774	death, supposing that Pierre had heard of it long before. All this at
 59775	the time seemed merely strange to Pierre: he felt he could not grasp its
 59776	significance. Just then he was only anxious to get away as quickly as
 59777	possible from places where people were killing one another, to some
 59778	peaceful refuge where he could recover himself, rest, and think over
 59779	all the strange new facts he had learned; but on reaching OrÃ«l he
 59780	immediately fell ill. When he came to himself after his illness he saw
 59781	in attendance on him two of his servants, TerÃ©nty and VÃ¡ska, who had
 59782	come from Moscow; and also his cousin the eldest princess, who had been
 59783	living on his estate at ElÃ©ts and hearing of his rescue and illness had
 59784	come to look after him.
 59785	
 59786	It was only gradually during his convalescence that Pierre lost the
 59787	impressions he had become accustomed to during the last few months
 59788	and got used to the idea that no one would oblige him to go anywhere
 59789	tomorrow, that no one would deprive him of his warm bed, and that he
 59790	would be sure to get his dinner, tea, and supper. But for a long time in
 59791	his dreams he still saw himself in the conditions of captivity. In the
 59792	same way little by little he came to understand the news he had been
 59793	told after his rescue, about the death of Prince Andrew, the death of
 59794	his wife, and the destruction of the French.
 59795	
 59796	A joyous feeling of freedomâthat complete inalienable freedom natural
 59797	to man which he had first experienced at the first halt outside
 59798	Moscowâfilled Pierreâs soul during his convalescence. He was surprised
 59799	to find that this inner freedom, which was independent of external
 59800	conditions, now had as it were an additional setting of external
 59801	liberty. He was alone in a strange town, without acquaintances. No one
 59802	demanded anything of him or sent him anywhere. He had all he wanted:
 59803	the thought of his wife which had been a continual torment to him was no
 59804	longer there, since she was no more.
 59805	
 59806	âOh, how good! How splendid!â said he to himself when a cleanly laid
 59807	table was moved up to him with savory beef tea, or when he lay down for
 59808	the night on a soft clean bed, or when he remembered that the French had
 59809	gone and that his wife was no more. âOh, how good, how splendid!â
 59810	
 59811	And by old habit he asked himself the question: âWell, and what then?
 59812	What am I going to do?â And he immediately gave himself the answer:
 59813	âWell, I shall live. Ah, how splendid!â
 59814	
 59815	The very question that had formerly tormented him, the thing he had
 59816	continually sought to findâthe aim of lifeâno longer existed for
 59817	him now. That search for the aim of life had not merely disappeared
 59818	temporarilyâhe felt that it no longer existed for him and could not
 59819	present itself again. And this very absence of an aim gave him the
 59820	complete, joyous sense of freedom which constituted his happiness at
 59821	this time.
 59822	
 59823	He could not see an aim, for he now had faithânot faith in any kind of
 59824	rule, or words, or ideas, but faith in an ever-living, ever-manifest
 59825	God. Formerly he had sought Him in aims he set himself. That search for
 59826	an aim had been simply a search for God, and suddenly in his captivity
 59827	he had learned not by words or reasoning but by direct feeling what his
 59828	nurse had told him long ago: that God is here and everywhere. In his
 59829	captivity he had learned that in KaratÃ¡ev God was greater, more infinite
 59830	and unfathomable than in the Architect of the Universe recognized by the
 59831	Freemasons. He felt like a man who after straining his eyes to see into
 59832	the far distance finds what he sought at his very feet. All his life
 59833	he had looked over the heads of the men around him, when he should have
 59834	merely looked in front of him without straining his eyes.
 59835	
 59836	In the past he had never been able to find that great inscrutable
 59837	infinite something. He had only felt that it must exist somewhere and
 59838	had looked for it. In everything near and comprehensible he had seen
 59839	only what was limited, petty, commonplace, and senseless. He had
 59840	equipped himself with a mental telescope and looked into remote space,
 59841	where petty worldliness hiding itself in misty distance had seemed to
 59842	him great and infinite merely because it was not clearly seen. And such
 59843	had European life, politics, Freemasonry, philosophy, and philanthropy
 59844	seemed to him. But even then, at moments of weakness as he had accounted
 59845	them, his mind had penetrated to those distances and he had there seen
 59846	the same pettiness, worldliness, and senselessness. Now, however, he
 59847	had learned to see the great, eternal, and infinite in everything, and
 59848	thereforeâto see it and enjoy its contemplationâhe naturally threw away
 59849	the telescope through which he had till now gazed over menâs heads, and
 59850	gladly regarded the ever-changing, eternally great, unfathomable, and
 59851	infinite life around him. And the closer he looked the more tranquil and
 59852	happy he became. That dreadful question, âWhat for?â which had formerly
 59853	destroyed all his mental edifices, no longer existed for him. To that
 59854	question, âWhat for?â a simple answer was now always ready in his soul:
 59855	âBecause there is a God, that God without whose will not one hair falls
 59856	from a manâs head.â
 59857	
 59858	
 59859	
 59860	
 59861	
 59862	CHAPTER XIII
 59863	
 59864	In external ways Pierre had hardly changed at all. In appearance he
 59865	was just what he used to be. As before he was absent-minded and seemed
 59866	occupied not with what was before his eyes but with something special
 59867	of his own. The difference between his former and present self was that
 59868	formerly when he did not grasp what lay before him or was said to
 59869	him, he had puckered his forehead painfully as if vainly seeking to
 59870	distinguish something at a distance. At present he still forgot what was
 59871	said to him and still did not see what was before his eyes, but he now
 59872	looked with a scarcely perceptible and seemingly ironic smile at what
 59873	was before him and listened to what was said, though evidently seeing
 59874	and hearing something quite different. Formerly he had appeared to be
 59875	a kindhearted but unhappy man, and so people had been inclined to avoid
 59876	him. Now a smile at the joy of life always played round his lips, and
 59877	sympathy for others shone in his eyes with a questioning look as to
 59878	whether they were as contented as he was, and people felt pleased by his
 59879	presence.
 59880	
 59881	Previously he had talked a great deal, grew excited when he talked, and
 59882	seldom listened; now he was seldom carried away in conversation and
 59883	knew how to listen so that people readily told him their most intimate
 59884	secrets.
 59885	
 59886	The princess, who had never liked Pierre and had been particularly
 59887	hostile to him since she had felt herself under obligations to him after
 59888	the old countâs death, now after staying a short time in OrÃ«lâwhere she
 59889	had come intending to show Pierre that in spite of his ingratitude she
 59890	considered it her duty to nurse himâfelt to her surprise and vexation
 59891	that she had become fond of him. Pierre did not in any way seek her
 59892	approval, he merely studied her with interest. Formerly she had felt
 59893	that he regarded her with indifference and irony, and so had shrunk into
 59894	herself as she did with others and had shown him only the combative side
 59895	of her nature; but now he seemed to be trying to understand the most
 59896	intimate places of her heart, and, mistrustfully at first but afterwards
 59897	gratefully, she let him see the hidden, kindly sides of her character.
 59898	
 59899	The most cunning man could not have crept into her confidence more
 59900	successfully, evoking memories of the best times of her youth and
 59901	showing sympathy with them. Yet Pierreâs cunning consisted simply in
 59902	finding pleasure in drawing out the human qualities of the embittered,
 59903	hard, and (in her own way) proud princess.
 59904	
 59905	âYes, he is a very, very kind man when he is not under the influence of
 59906	bad people but of people such as myself,â thought she.
 59907	
 59908	His servants tooâTerÃ©nty and VÃ¡skaâin their own way noticed the change
 59909	that had taken place in Pierre. They considered that he had become much
 59910	âsimpler.â TerÃ©nty, when he had helped him undress and wished him good
 59911	night, often lingered with his masterâs boots in his hands and clothes
 59912	over his arm, to see whether he would not start a talk. And Pierre,
 59913	noticing that TerÃ©nty wanted a chat, generally kept him there.
 59914	
 59915	âWell, tell me... now, how did you get food?â he would ask.
 59916	
 59917	And TerÃ©nty would begin talking of the destruction of Moscow, and of
 59918	the old count, and would stand for a long time holding the clothes and
 59919	talking, or sometimes listening to Pierreâs stories, and then would go
 59920	out into the hall with a pleasant sense of intimacy with his master and
 59921	affection for him.
 59922	
 59923	The doctor who attended Pierre and visited him every day, though he
 59924	considered it his duty as a doctor to pose as a man whose every moment
 59925	was of value to suffering humanity, would sit for hours with Pierre
 59926	telling him his favorite anecdotes and his observations on the
 59927	characters of his patients in general, and especially of the ladies.
 59928	
 59929	âItâs a pleasure to talk to a man like that; he is not like our
 59930	provincials,â he would say.
 59931	
 59932	There were several prisoners from the French army in OrÃ«l, and the
 59933	doctor brought one of them, a young Italian, to see Pierre.
 59934	
 59935	This officer began visiting Pierre, and the princess used to make fun of
 59936	the tenderness the Italian expressed for him.
 59937	
 59938	The Italian seemed happy only when he could come to see Pierre, talk
 59939	with him, tell him about his past, his life at home, and his love,
 59940	and pour out to him his indignation against the French and especially
 59941	against Napoleon.
 59942	
 59943	âIf all Russians are in the least like you, it is sacrilege to fight
 59944	such a nation,â he said to Pierre. âYou, who have suffered so from the
 59945	French, do not even feel animosity toward them.â
 59946	
 59947	Pierre had evoked the passionate affection of the Italian merely by
 59948	evoking the best side of his nature and taking a pleasure in so doing.
 59949	
 59950	During the last days of Pierreâs stay in OrÃ«l his old Masonic
 59951	acquaintance Count Willarski, who had introduced him to the lodge in
 59952	1807, came to see him. Willarski was married to a Russian heiress who
 59953	had a large estate in OrÃ«l province, and he occupied a temporary post in
 59954	the commissariat department in that town.
 59955	
 59956	Hearing that BezÃºkhov was in OrÃ«l, Willarski, though they had never been
 59957	intimate, came to him with the professions of friendship and intimacy
 59958	that people who meet in a desert generally express for one another.
 59959	Willarski felt dull in OrÃ«l and was pleased to meet a man of his own
 59960	circle and, as he supposed, of similar interests.
 59961	
 59962	But to his surprise Willarski soon noticed that Pierre had lagged much
 59963	behind the times, and had sunk, as he expressed it to himself, into
 59964	apathy and egotism.
 59965	
 59966	âYou are letting yourself go, my dear fellow,â he said.
 59967	
 59968	But for all that Willarski found it pleasanter now than it had been
 59969	formerly to be with Pierre, and came to see him every day. To Pierre as
 59970	he looked at and listened to Willarski, it seemed strange to think that
 59971	he had been like that himself but a short time before.
 59972	
 59973	Willarski was a married man with a family, busy with his family affairs,
 59974	his wifeâs affairs, and his official duties. He regarded all these
 59975	occupations as hindrances to life, and considered that they were all
 59976	contemptible because their aim was the welfare of himself and his
 59977	family. Military, administrative, political, and Masonic interests
 59978	continually absorbed his attention. And Pierre, without trying to
 59979	change the otherâs views and without condemning him, but with the quiet,
 59980	joyful, and amused smile now habitual to him, was interested in this
 59981	strange though very familiar phenomenon.
 59982	
 59983	There was a new feature in Pierreâs relations with Willarski, with the
 59984	princess, with the doctor, and with all the people he now met, which
 59985	gained for him the general good will. This was his acknowledgment of
 59986	the impossibility of changing a manâs convictions by words, and his
 59987	recognition of the possibility of everyone thinking, feeling, and seeing
 59988	things each from his own point of view. This legitimate peculiarity of
 59989	each individual which used to excite and irritate Pierre now became a
 59990	basis of the sympathy he felt for, and the interest he took in, other
 59991	people. The difference, and sometimes complete contradiction, between
 59992	menâs opinions and their lives, and between one man and another, pleased
 59993	him and drew from him an amused and gentle smile.
 59994	
 59995	In practical matters Pierre unexpectedly felt within himself a center
 59996	of gravity he had previously lacked. Formerly all pecuniary questions,
 59997	especially requests for money to which, as an extremely wealthy man,
 59998	he was very exposed, produced in him a state of hopeless agitation and
 59999	perplexity. âTo give or not to give?â he had asked himself. âI have
 60000	it and he needs it. But someone else needs it still more. Who needs it
 60001	most? And perhaps they are both impostors?â In the old days he had been
 60002	unable to find a way out of all these surmises and had given to all
 60003	who asked as long as he had anything to give. Formerly he had been in a
 60004	similar state of perplexity with regard to every question concerning his
 60005	property, when one person advised one thing and another something else.
 60006	
 60007	Now to his surprise he found that he no longer felt either doubt or
 60008	perplexity about these questions. There was now within him a judge who
 60009	by some rule unknown to him decided what should or should not be done.
 60010	
 60011	He was as indifferent as heretofore to money matters, but now he felt
 60012	certain of what ought and what ought not to be done. The first time he
 60013	had recourse to his new judge was when a French prisoner, a colonel,
 60014	came to him and, after talking a great deal about his exploits,
 60015	concluded by making what amounted to a demand that Pierre should give
 60016	him four thousand francs to send to his wife and children. Pierre
 60017	refused without the least difficulty or effort, and was afterwards
 60018	surprised how simple and easy had been what used to appear so
 60019	insurmountably difficult. At the same time that he refused the colonelâs
 60020	demand he made up his mind that he must have recourse to artifice when
 60021	leaving OrÃ«l, to induce the Italian officer to accept some money of
 60022	which he was evidently in need. A further proof to Pierre of his own
 60023	more settled outlook on practical matters was furnished by his decision
 60024	with regard to his wifeâs debts and to the rebuilding of his houses in
 60025	and near Moscow.
 60026	
 60027	His head steward came to him at OrÃ«l and Pierre reckoned up with him his
 60028	diminished income. The burning of Moscow had cost him, according to the
 60029	head stewardâs calculation, about two million rubles.
 60030	
 60031	To console Pierre for these losses the head steward gave him an estimate
 60032	showing that despite these losses his income would not be diminished but
 60033	would even be increased if he refused to pay his wifeâs debts which he
 60034	was under no obligation to meet, and did not rebuild his Moscow house
 60035	and the country house on his Moscow estate, which had cost him eighty
 60036	thousand rubles a year and brought in nothing.
 60037	
 60038	âYes, of course thatâs true,â said Pierre with a cheerful smile. âI
 60039	donât need all that at all. By being ruined I have become much richer.â
 60040	
 60041	But in January SavÃ©lich came from Moscow and gave him an account of the
 60042	state of things there, and spoke of the estimate an architect had made
 60043	of the cost of rebuilding the town and country houses, speaking of this
 60044	as of a settled matter. About the same time he received letters from
 60045	Prince VasÃ­li and other Petersburg acquaintances speaking of his wifeâs
 60046	debts. And Pierre decided that the stewardâs proposals which had so
 60047	pleased him were wrong and that he must go to Petersburg and settle his
 60048	wifeâs affairs and must rebuild in Moscow. Why this was necessary he
 60049	did not know, but he knew for certain that it was necessary. His income
 60050	would be reduced by three fourths, but he felt it must be done.
 60051	
 60052	Willarski was going to Moscow and they agreed to travel together.
 60053	
 60054	During the whole time of his convalescence in OrÃ«l Pierre had
 60055	experienced a feeling of joy, freedom, and life; but when during his
 60056	journey he found himself in the open world and saw hundreds of new
 60057	faces, that feeling was intensified. Throughout his journey he felt like
 60058	a schoolboy on holiday. Everyoneâthe stagecoach driver, the post-house
 60059	overseers, the peasants on the roads and in the villagesâhad a new
 60060	significance for him. The presence and remarks of Willarski who
 60061	continually deplored the ignorance and poverty of Russia and its
 60062	backwardness compared with Europe only heightened Pierreâs pleasure.
 60063	Where Willarski saw deadness Pierre saw an extraordinary strength and
 60064	vitalityâthe strength which in that vast space amid the snows maintained
 60065	the life of this original, peculiar, and unique people. He did not
 60066	contradict Willarski and even seemed to agree with himâan apparent
 60067	agreement being the simplest way to avoid discussions that could lead to
 60068	nothingâand he smiled joyfully as he listened to him.
 60069	
 60070	
 60071

 60073	
 60074	CHAPTER XIV
 60075	
 60076	It would be difficult to explain why and whither ants whose heap
 60077	has been destroyed are hurrying: some from the heap dragging bits of
 60078	rubbish, larvae, and corpses, others back to the heap, or why they
 60079	jostle, overtake one another, and fight, and it would be equally
 60080	difficult to explain what caused the Russians after the departure of the
 60081	French to throng to the place that had formerly been Moscow. But when
 60082	we watch the ants round their ruined heap, the tenacity, energy, and
 60083	immense number of the delving insects prove that despite the destruction
 60084	of the heap, something indestructible, which though intangible is the
 60085	real strength of the colony, still exists; and similarly, though in
 60086	Moscow in the month of October there was no government and no churches,
 60087	shrines, riches, or housesâit was still the Moscow it had been in
 60088	August. All was destroyed, except something intangible yet powerful and
 60089	indestructible.
 60090	
 60091	The motives of those who thronged from all sides to Moscow after it had
 60092	been cleared of the enemy were most diverse and personal, and at first
 60093	for the most part savage and brutal. One motive only they all had in
 60094	common: a desire to get to the place that had been called Moscow, to
 60095	apply their activities there.
 60096	
 60097	Within a week Moscow already had fifteen thousand inhabitants, in a
 60098	fortnight twenty-five thousand, and so on. By the autumn of 1813 the
 60099	number, ever increasing and increasing, exceeded what it had been in
 60100	1812.
 60101	
 60102	The first Russians to enter Moscow were the Cossacks of Wintzingerodeâs
 60103	detachment, peasants from the adjacent villages, and residents who had
 60104	fled from Moscow and had been hiding in its vicinity. The Russians who
 60105	entered Moscow, finding it plundered, plundered it in their turn. They
 60106	continued what the French had begun. Trains of peasant carts came to
 60107	Moscow to carry off to the villages what had been abandoned in the
 60108	ruined houses and the streets. The Cossacks carried off what they could
 60109	to their camps, and the householders seized all they could find in other
 60110	houses and moved it to their own, pretending that it was their property.
 60111	
 60112	But the first plunderers were followed by a second and a third
 60113	contingent, and with increasing numbers plundering became more and more
 60114	difficult and assumed more definite forms.
 60115	
 60116	The French found Moscow abandoned but with all the organizations of
 60117	regular life, with diverse branches of commerce and craftsmanship, with
 60118	luxury, and governmental and religious institutions. These forms were
 60119	lifeless but still existed. There were bazaars, shops, warehouses,
 60120	market stalls, granariesâfor the most part still stocked with goodsâand
 60121	there were factories and workshops, palaces and wealthy houses filled
 60122	with luxuries, hospitals, prisons, government offices, churches, and
 60123	cathedrals. The longer the French remained the more these forms of town
 60124	life perished, until finally all was merged into one confused, lifeless
 60125	scene of plunder.
 60126	
 60127	The more the plundering by the French continued, the more both the
 60128	wealth of Moscow and the strength of its plunderers was destroyed. But
 60129	plundering by the Russians, with which the reoccupation of the city
 60130	began, had an opposite effect: the longer it continued and the greater
 60131	the number of people taking part in it the more rapidly was the wealth
 60132	of the city and its regular life restored.
 60133	
 60134	Besides the plunderers, very various people, some drawn by curiosity,
 60135	some by official duties, some by self-interestâhouse owners, clergy,
 60136	officials of all kinds, tradesmen, artisans, and peasantsâstreamed into
 60137	Moscow as blood flows to the heart.
 60138	
 60139	Within a week the peasants who came with empty carts to carry off
 60140	plunder were stopped by the authorities and made to cart the corpses
 60141	out of the town. Other peasants, having heard of their comradesâ
 60142	discomfiture, came to town bringing rye, oats, and hay, and beat down
 60143	one anotherâs prices to below what they had been in former days. Gangs
 60144	of carpenters hoping for high pay arrived in Moscow every day, and on
 60145	all sides logs were being hewn, new houses built, and old, charred ones
 60146	repaired. Tradesmen began trading in booths. Cookshops and taverns were
 60147	opened in partially burned houses. The clergy resumed the services
 60148	in many churches that had not been burned. Donors contributed
 60149	Church property that had been stolen. Government clerks set up their
 60150	baize-covered tables and their pigeonholes of documents in small rooms.
 60151	The higher authorities and the police organized the distribution of
 60152	goods left behind by the French. The owners of houses in which much
 60153	property had been left, brought there from other houses, complained of
 60154	the injustice of taking everything to the Faceted Palace in the KrÃ©mlin;
 60155	others insisted that as the French had gathered things from different
 60156	houses into this or that house, it would be unfair to allow its owner to
 60157	keep all that was found there. They abused the police and bribed them,
 60158	made out estimates at ten times their value for government stores that
 60159	had perished in the fire, and demanded relief. And Count RostopchÃ­n
 60160	wrote proclamations.
 60161	
 60162	
 60163	
 60164	
 60165	
 60166	CHAPTER XV
 60167	
 60168	At the end of January Pierre went to Moscow and stayed in an annex of
 60169	his house which had not been burned. He called on Count RostopchÃ­n and
 60170	on some acquaintances who were back in Moscow, and he intended to leave
 60171	for Petersburg two days later. Everybody was celebrating the victory,
 60172	everything was bubbling with life in the ruined but reviving city.
 60173	Everyone was pleased to see Pierre, everyone wished to meet him, and
 60174	everyone questioned him about what he had seen. Pierre felt particularly
 60175	well disposed toward them all, but was now instinctively on his
 60176	guard for fear of binding himself in any way. To all questions put to
 60177	himâwhether important or quite triflingâsuch as: Where would he live?
 60178	Was he going to rebuild? When was he going to Petersburg and would he
 60179	mind taking a parcel for someone?âhe replied: âYes, perhaps,â or, âI
 60180	think so,â and so on.
 60181	
 60182	He had heard that the RostÃ³vs were at KostromÃ¡ but the thought of
 60183	NatÃ¡sha seldom occurred to him. If it did it was only as a pleasant
 60184	memory of the distant past. He felt himself not only free from social
 60185	obligations but also from that feeling which, it seemed to him, he had
 60186	aroused in himself.
 60187	
 60188	On the third day after his arrival he heard from the DrubetskÃ³ys that
 60189	Princess Mary was in Moscow. The death, sufferings, and last days of
 60190	Prince Andrew had often occupied Pierreâs thoughts and now recurred to
 60191	him with fresh vividness. Having heard at dinner that Princess Mary
 60192	was in Moscow and living in her houseâwhich had not been burnedâin
 60193	VozdvÃ­zhenka Street, he drove that same evening to see her.
 60194	
 60195	On his way to the house Pierre kept thinking of Prince Andrew, of their
 60196	friendship, of his various meetings with him, and especially of the last
 60197	one at BorodinÃ³.
 60198	
 60199	âIs it possible that he died in the bitter frame of mind he was then in?
 60200	Is it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him
 60201	before he died?â thought Pierre. He recalled KaratÃ¡ev and his death and
 60202	involuntarily began to compare these two men, so different, and yet so
 60203	similar in that they had both lived and both died and in the love he
 60204	felt for both of them.
 60205	
 60206	Pierre drove up to the house of the old prince in a most serious mood.
 60207	The house had escaped the fire; it showed signs of damage but its
 60208	general aspect was unchanged. The old footman, who met Pierre with a
 60209	stern face as if wishing to make the visitor feel that the absence
 60210	of the old prince had not disturbed the order of things in the house,
 60211	informed him that the princess had gone to her own apartments, and that
 60212	she received on Sundays.
 60213	
 60214	âAnnounce me. Perhaps she will see me,â said Pierre.
 60215	
 60216	âYes, sir,â said the man. âPlease step into the portrait gallery.â
 60217	
 60218	A few minutes later the footman returned with Dessalles, who brought
 60219	word from the princess that she would be very glad to see Pierre if he
 60220	would excuse her want of ceremony and come upstairs to her apartment.
 60221	
 60222	In a rather low room lit by one candle sat the princess and with her
 60223	another person dressed in black. Pierre remembered that the princess
 60224	always had lady companions, but who they were and what they were like
 60225	he never knew or remembered. âThis must be one of her companions,â he
 60226	thought, glancing at the lady in the black dress.
 60227	
 60228	The princess rose quickly to meet him and held out her hand.
 60229	
 60230	âYes,â she said, looking at his altered face after he had kissed her
 60231	hand, âso this is how we meet again. He spoke of you even at the very
 60232	last,â she went on, turning her eyes from Pierre to her companion with a
 60233	shyness that surprised him for an instant.
 60234	
 60235	âI was so glad to hear of your safety. It was the first piece of good
 60236	news we had received for a long time.â
 60237	
 60238	Again the princess glanced round at her companion with even more
 60239	uneasiness in her manner and was about to add something, but Pierre
 60240	interrupted her.
 60241	
 60242	âJust imagineâI knew nothing about him!â said he. âI thought he had been
 60243	killed. All I know I heard at second hand from others. I only know that
 60244	he fell in with the RostÃ³vs.... What a strange coincidence!â
 60245	
 60246	Pierre spoke rapidly and with animation. He glanced once at the
 60247	companionâs face, saw her attentive and kindly gaze fixed on him, and,
 60248	as often happens when one is talking, felt somehow that this companion
 60249	in the black dress was a good, kind, excellent creature who would not
 60250	hinder his conversing freely with Princess Mary.
 60251	
 60252	But when he mentioned the RostÃ³vs, Princess Maryâs face expressed still
 60253	greater embarrassment. She again glanced rapidly from Pierreâs face to
 60254	that of the lady in the black dress and said:
 60255	
 60256	âDo you really not recognize her?â
 60257	
 60258	Pierre looked again at the companionâs pale, delicate face with its
 60259	black eyes and peculiar mouth, and something near to him, long forgotten
 60260	and more than sweet, looked at him from those attentive eyes.
 60261	
 60262	âBut no, it canât be!â he thought. âThis stern, thin, pale face that
 60263	looks so much older! It cannot be she. It merely reminds me of her.â
 60264	But at that moment Princess Mary said, âNatÃ¡sha!â And with difficulty,
 60265	effort, and stress, like the opening of a door grown rusty on its
 60266	hinges, a smile appeared on the face with the attentive eyes, and from
 60267	that opening door came a breath of fragrance which suffused Pierre with
 60268	a happiness he had long forgotten and of which he had not even been
 60269	thinkingâespecially at that moment. It suffused him, seized him, and
 60270	enveloped him completely. When she smiled doubt was no longer possible,
 60271	it was NatÃ¡sha and he loved her.
 60272	
 60273	At that moment Pierre involuntarily betrayed to her, to Princess Mary,
 60274	and above all to himself, a secret of which he himself had been unaware.
 60275	He flushed joyfully yet with painful distress. He tried to hide his
 60276	agitation. But the more he tried to hide it the more clearlyâclearer
 60277	than any words could have doneâdid he betray to himself, to her, and to
 60278	Princess Mary that he loved her.
 60279	
 60280	âNo, itâs only the unexpectedness of it,â thought Pierre. But as soon as
 60281	he tried to continue the conversation he had begun with Princess Mary he
 60282	again glanced at NatÃ¡sha, and a still-deeper flush suffused his face and
 60283	a still-stronger agitation of mingled joy and fear seized his soul. He
 60284	became confused in his speech and stopped in the middle of what he was
 60285	saying.
 60286	
 60287	Pierre had failed to notice NatÃ¡sha because he did not at all expect to
 60288	see her there, but he had failed to recognize her because the change in
 60289	her since he last saw her was immense. She had grown thin and pale, but
 60290	that was not what made her unrecognizable; she was unrecognizable at the
 60291	moment he entered because on that face whose eyes had always shone with
 60292	a suppressed smile of the joy of life, now when he first entered and
 60293	glanced at her there was not the least shadow of a smile: only her eyes
 60294	were kindly attentive and sadly interrogative.
 60295	
 60296	Pierreâs confusion was not reflected by any confusion on NatÃ¡shaâs part,
 60297	but only by the pleasure that just perceptibly lit up her whole face.
 60298	
 60299

 60302	
 60303	CHAPTER XVI
 60304	
 60305	âShe has come to stay with me,â said Princess Mary. âThe count and
 60306	countess will be here in a few days. The countess is in a dreadful
 60307	state; but it was necessary for NatÃ¡sha herself to see a doctor. They
 60308	insisted on her coming with me.â
 60309	
 60310	âYes, is there a family free from sorrow now?â said Pierre, addressing
 60311	NatÃ¡sha. âYou know it happened the very day we were rescued. I saw him.
 60312	What a delightful boy he was!â
 60313	
 60314	NatÃ¡sha looked at him, and by way of answer to his words her eyes
 60315	widened and lit up.
 60316	
 60317	âWhat can one say or think of as a consolation?â said Pierre. âNothing!
 60318	Why had such a splendid boy, so full of life, to die?â
 60319	
 60320	âYes, in these days it would be hard to live without faith...â remarked
 60321	Princess Mary.
 60322	
 60323	âYes, yes, that is really true,â Pierre hastily interrupted her.
 60324	
 60325	âWhy is it true?â NatÃ¡sha asked, looking attentively into Pierreâs eyes.
 60326	
 60327	âHow can you ask why?â said Princess Mary. âThe thought alone of what
 60328	awaits...â
 60329	
 60330	NatÃ¡sha without waiting for Princess Mary to finish again looked
 60331	inquiringly at Pierre.
 60332	
 60333	âAnd because,â Pierre continued, âonly one who believes that there is a
 60334	God ruling us can bear a loss such as hers and... yours.â
 60335	
 60336	NatÃ¡sha had already opened her mouth to speak but suddenly stopped.
 60337	Pierre hurriedly turned away from her and again addressed Princess Mary,
 60338	asking about his friendâs last days.
 60339	
 60340	Pierreâs confusion had now almost vanished, but at the same time he felt
 60341	that his freedom had also completely gone. He felt that there was now a
 60342	judge of his every word and action whose judgment mattered more to
 60343	him than that of all the rest of the world. As he spoke now he was
 60344	considering what impression his words would make on NatÃ¡sha. He did
 60345	not purposely say things to please her, but whatever he was saying he
 60346	regarded from her standpoint.
 60347	
 60348	Princess Maryâreluctantly as is usual in such casesâbegan telling of
 60349	the condition in which she had found Prince Andrew. But Pierreâs face
 60350	quivering with emotion, his questions and his eager restless expression,
 60351	gradually compelled her to go into details which she feared to recall
 60352	for her own sake.
 60353	
 60354	âYes, yes, and so...?â Pierre kept saying as he leaned toward her with
 60355	his whole body and eagerly listened to her story. âYes, yes... so he
 60356	grew tranquil and softened? With all his soul he had always sought
 60357	one thingâto be perfectly goodâso he could not be afraid of death. The
 60358	faults he hadâif he had anyâwere not of his making. So he did soften?...
 60359	What a happy thing that he saw you again,â he added, suddenly turning to
 60360	NatÃ¡sha and looking at her with eyes full of tears.
 60361	
 60362	NatÃ¡shaâs face twitched. She frowned and lowered her eyes for a moment.
 60363	She hesitated for an instant whether to speak or not.
 60364	
 60365	âYes, that was happiness,â she then said in her quiet voice with its
 60366	deep chest notes. âFor me it certainly was happiness.â She paused. âAnd
 60367	he... he... he said he was wishing for it at the very moment I entered
 60368	the room....â
 60369	
 60370	NatÃ¡shaâs voice broke. She blushed, pressed her clasped hands on her
 60371	knees, and then controlling herself with an evident effort lifted her
 60372	head and began to speak rapidly.
 60373	
 60374	âWe knew nothing of it when we started from Moscow. I did not dare to
 60375	ask about him. Then suddenly SÃ³nya told me he was traveling with us. I
 60376	had no idea and could not imagine what state he was in, all I wanted was
 60377	to see him and be with him,â she said, trembling, and breathing quickly.
 60378	
 60379	And not letting them interrupt her she went on to tell what she had
 60380	never yet mentioned to anyoneâall she had lived through during those
 60381	three weeks of their journey and life at YaroslÃ¡vl.
 60382	
 60383	Pierre listened to her with lips parted and eyes fixed upon her full of
 60384	tears. As he listened he did not think of Prince Andrew, nor of death,
 60385	nor of what she was telling. He listened to her and felt only pity for
 60386	her, for what she was suffering now while she was speaking.
 60387	
 60388	Princess Mary, frowning in her effort to hold back her tears, sat beside
 60389	NatÃ¡sha, and heard for the first time the story of those last days of
 60390	her brotherâs and NatÃ¡shaâs love.
 60391	
 60392	Evidently NatÃ¡sha needed to tell that painful yet joyful tale.
 60393	
 60394	She spoke, mingling most trifling details with the intimate secrets of
 60395	her soul, and it seemed as if she could never finish. Several times she
 60396	repeated the same thing twice.
 60397	
 60398	Dessallesâ voice was heard outside the door asking whether little
 60399	Nicholas might come in to say good night.
 60400	
 60401	âWell, thatâs allâeverything,â said NatÃ¡sha.
 60402	
 60403	She got up quickly just as Nicholas entered, almost ran to the door
 60404	which was hidden by curtains, struck her head against it, and rushed
 60405	from the room with a moan either of pain or sorrow.
 60406	
 60407	Pierre gazed at the door through which she had disappeared and did not
 60408	understand why he suddenly felt all alone in the world.
 60409	
 60410	Princess Mary roused him from his abstraction by drawing his attention
 60411	to her nephew who had entered the room.
 60412	
 60413	At that moment of emotional tenderness young Nicholasâ face, which
 60414	resembled his fatherâs, affected Pierre so much that when he had kissed
 60415	the boy he got up quickly, took out his handkerchief, and went to the
 60416	window. He wished to take leave of Princess Mary, but she would not let
 60417	him go.
 60418	
 60419	âNo, NatÃ¡sha and I sometimes donât go to sleep till after two, so please
 60420	donât go. I will order supper. Go downstairs, we will come immediately.â
 60421	
 60422	Before Pierre left the room Princess Mary told him: âThis is the first
 60423	time she has talked of him like that.â
 60424	
 60425	
 60426	
 60427	
 60428	
 60429	CHAPTER XVII
 60430	
 60431	Pierre was shown into the large, brightly lit dining room; a few minutes
 60432	later he heard footsteps and Princess Mary entered with NatÃ¡sha. NatÃ¡sha
 60433	was calm, though a severe and grave expression had again settled on her
 60434	face. They all three of them now experienced that feeling of awkwardness
 60435	which usually follows after a serious and heartfelt talk. It is
 60436	impossible to go back to the same conversation, to talk of trifles is
 60437	awkward, and yet the desire to speak is there and silence seems like
 60438	affectation. They went silently to table. The footmen drew back the
 60439	chairs and pushed them up again. Pierre unfolded his cold table napkin
 60440	and, resolving to break the silence, looked at NatÃ¡sha and at Princess
 60441	Mary. They had evidently both formed the same resolution; the eyes of
 60442	both shone with satisfaction and a confession that besides sorrow life
 60443	also has joy.
 60444	
 60445	âDo you take vodka, Count?â asked Princess Mary, and those words
 60446	suddenly banished the shadows of the past. âNow tell us about yourself,â
 60447	said she. âOne hears such improbable wonders about you.â
 60448	
 60449	âYes,â replied Pierre with the smile of mild irony now habitual to him.
 60450	âThey even tell me wonders I myself never dreamed of! Mary AbrÃ¡movna
 60451	invited me to her house and kept telling me what had happened, or ought
 60452	to have happened, to me. StepÃ¡n StepÃ¡nych also instructed me how I ought
 60453	to tell of my experiences. In general I have noticed that it is very
 60454	easy to be an interesting man (I am an interesting man now); people
 60455	invite me out and tell me all about myself.â
 60456	
 60457	NatÃ¡sha smiled and was on the point of speaking.
 60458	
 60459	âWe have been told,â Princess Mary interrupted her, âthat you lost two
 60460	millions in Moscow. Is that true?â
 60461	
 60462	âBut I am three times as rich as before,â returned Pierre.
 60463	
 60464	Though the position was now altered by his decision to pay his wifeâs
 60465	debts and to rebuild his houses, Pierre still maintained that he had
 60466	become three times as rich as before.
 60467	
 60468	âWhat I have certainly gained is freedom,â he began seriously, but did
 60469	not continue, noticing that this theme was too egotistic.
 60470	
 60471	âAnd are you building?â
 60472	
 60473	âYes. SavÃ©lich says I must!â
 60474	
 60475	âTell me, you did not know of the countessâ death when you decided to
 60476	remain in Moscow?â asked Princess Mary and immediately blushed, noticing
 60477	that her question, following his mention of freedom, ascribed to his
 60478	words a meaning he had perhaps not intended.
 60479	
 60480	âNo,â answered Pierre, evidently not considering awkward the meaning
 60481	Princess Mary had given to his words. âI heard of it in OrÃ«l and you
 60482	cannot imagine how it shocked me. We were not an exemplary couple,â he
 60483	added quickly, glancing at NatÃ¡sha and noticing on her face curiosity as
 60484	to how he would speak of his wife, âbut her death shocked me terribly.
 60485	When two people quarrel they are always both in fault, and oneâs own
 60486	guilt suddenly becomes terribly serious when the other is no longer
 60487	alive. And then such a death... without friends and without consolation!
 60488	I am very, very sorry for her,â he concluded, and was pleased to notice
 60489	a look of glad approval on NatÃ¡shaâs face.
 60490	
 60491	âYes, and so you are once more an eligible bachelor,â said Princess
 60492	Mary.
 60493	
 60494	Pierre suddenly flushed crimson and for a long time tried not to look
 60495	at NatÃ¡sha. When he ventured to glance her way again her face was cold,
 60496	stern, and he fancied even contemptuous.
 60497	
 60498	âAnd did you really see and speak to Napoleon, as we have been told?â
 60499	said Princess Mary.
 60500	
 60501	Pierre laughed.
 60502	
 60503	âNo, not once! Everybody seems to imagine that being taken prisoner
 60504	means being Napoleonâs guest. Not only did I never see him but I heard
 60505	nothing about himâI was in much lower company!â
 60506	
 60507	Supper was over, and Pierre who at first declined to speak about his
 60508	captivity was gradually led on to do so.
 60509	
 60510	âBut itâs true that you remained in Moscow to kill Napoleon?â NatÃ¡sha
 60511	asked with a slight smile. âI guessed it then when we met at the
 60512	SÃºkharev tower, do you remember?â
 60513	
 60514	Pierre admitted that it was true, and from that was gradually led by
 60515	Princess Maryâs questions and especially by NatÃ¡shaâs into giving a
 60516	detailed account of his adventures.
 60517	
 60518	At first he spoke with the amused and mild irony now customary with
 60519	him toward everybody and especially toward himself, but when he came
 60520	to describe the horrors and sufferings he had witnessed he was
 60521	unconsciously carried away and began speaking with the suppressed
 60522	emotion of a man re-experiencing in recollection strong impressions he
 60523	has lived through.
 60524	
 60525	Princess Mary with a gentle smile looked now at Pierre and now at
 60526	NatÃ¡sha. In the whole narrative she saw only Pierre and his goodness.
 60527	NatÃ¡sha, leaning on her elbow, the expression of her face constantly
 60528	changing with the narrative, watched Pierre with an attention that never
 60529	wanderedâevidently herself experiencing all that he described. Not only
 60530	her look, but her exclamations and the brief questions she put, showed
 60531	Pierre that she understood just what he wished to convey. It was clear
 60532	that she understood not only what he said but also what he wished to,
 60533	but could not, express in words. The account Pierre gave of the incident
 60534	with the child and the woman for protecting whom he was arrested was
 60535	this: âIt was an awful sightâchildren abandoned, some in the flames...
 60536	One was snatched out before my eyes... and there were women who had
 60537	their things snatched off and their earrings torn out...â he flushed and
 60538	grew confused. âThen a patrol arrived and all the menâall those who were
 60539	not looting, that isâwere arrested, and I among them.â
 60540	
 60541	âI am sure youâre not telling us everything; I am sure you did
 60542	something...â said NatÃ¡sha and pausing added, âsomething fine?â
 60543	
 60544	Pierre continued. When he spoke of the execution he wanted to pass
 60545	over the horrible details, but NatÃ¡sha insisted that he should not omit
 60546	anything.
 60547	
 60548	Pierre began to tell about KaratÃ¡ev, but paused. By this time he had
 60549	risen from the table and was pacing the room, NatÃ¡sha following him with
 60550	her eyes. Then he added:
 60551	
 60552	âNo, you canât understand what I learned from that illiterate manâthat
 60553	simple fellow.â
 60554	
 60555	âYes, yes, go on!â said NatÃ¡sha. âWhere is he?â
 60556	
 60557	âThey killed him almost before my eyes.â
 60558	
 60559	And Pierre, his voice trembling continually, went on to tell of the last
 60560	days of their retreat, of KaratÃ¡evâs illness and his death.
 60561	
 60562	He told of his adventures as he had never yet recalled them. He now, as
 60563	it were, saw a new meaning in all he had gone through. Now that he was
 60564	telling it all to NatÃ¡sha he experienced that pleasure which a man has
 60565	when women listen to himânot clever women who when listening either try
 60566	to remember what they hear to enrich their minds and when opportunity
 60567	offers to retell it, or who wish to adopt it to some thought of their
 60568	own and promptly contribute their own clever comments prepared in their
 60569	little mental workshopâbut the pleasure given by real women gifted with
 60570	a capacity to select and absorb the very best a man shows of himself.
 60571	NatÃ¡sha without knowing it was all attention: she did not lose a word,
 60572	no single quiver in Pierreâs voice, no look, no twitch of a muscle in
 60573	his face, nor a single gesture. She caught the unfinished word in its
 60574	flight and took it straight into her open heart, divining the secret
 60575	meaning of all Pierreâs mental travail.
 60576	
 60577	Princess Mary understood his story and sympathized with him, but she
 60578	now saw something else that absorbed all her attention. She saw the
 60579	possibility of love and happiness between NatÃ¡sha and Pierre, and the
 60580	first thought of this filled her heart with gladness.
 60581	
 60582	It was three oâclock in the morning. The footmen came in with sad and
 60583	stern faces to change the candles, but no one noticed them.
 60584	
 60585	Pierre finished his story. NatÃ¡sha continued to look at him intently
 60586	with bright, attentive, and animated eyes, as if trying to understand
 60587	something more which he had perhaps left untold. Pierre in shamefaced
 60588	and happy confusion glanced occasionally at her, and tried to think what
 60589	to say next to introduce a fresh subject. Princess Mary was silent. It
 60590	occurred to none of them that it was three oâclock and time to go to
 60591	bed.
 60592	
 60593	âPeople speak of misfortunes and sufferings,â remarked Pierre, âbut if
 60594	at this moment I were asked: âWould you rather be what you were before
 60595	you were taken prisoner, or go through all this again?â then for
 60596	heavenâs sake let me again have captivity and horseflesh! We imagine
 60597	that when we are thrown out of our usual ruts all is lost, but it is
 60598	only then that what is new and good begins. While there is life there is
 60599	happiness. There is much, much before us. I say this to you,â he added,
 60600	turning to NatÃ¡sha.
 60601	
 60602	âYes, yes,â she said, answering something quite different. âI too should
 60603	wish nothing but to relive it all from the beginning.â
 60604	
 60605	Pierre looked intently at her.
 60606	
 60607	âYes, and nothing more,â said NatÃ¡sha.
 60608	
 60609	âItâs not true, not true!â cried Pierre. âI am not to blame for being
 60610	alive and wishing to liveânor you either.â
 60611	
 60612	Suddenly NatÃ¡sha bent her head, covered her face with her hands, and
 60613	began to cry.
 60614	
 60615	âWhat is it, NatÃ¡sha?â said Princess Mary.
 60616	
 60617	âNothing, nothing.â She smiled at Pierre through her tears. âGood night!
 60618	It is time for bed.â
 60619	
 60620	Pierre rose and took his leave.
 60621	
 60622	
 60623	Princess Mary and NatÃ¡sha met as usual in the bedroom. They talked of
 60624	what Pierre had told them. Princess Mary did not express her opinion of
 60625	Pierre nor did NatÃ¡sha speak of him.
 60626	
 60627	âWell, good night, Mary!â said NatÃ¡sha. âDo you know, I am often afraid
 60628	that by not speaking of himâ (she meant Prince Andrew) âfor fear of not
 60629	doing justice to our feelings, we forget him.â
 60630	
 60631	Princess Mary sighed deeply and thereby acknowledged the justice of
 60632	NatÃ¡shaâs remark, but she did not express agreement in words.
 60633	
 60634	âIs it possible to forget?â said she.
 60635	
 60636	âIt did me so much good to tell all about it today. It was hard and
 60637	painful, but good, very good!â said NatÃ¡sha. âI am sure he really loved
 60638	him. That is why I told him... Was it all right?â she added, suddenly
 60639	blushing.
 60640	
 60641	âTo tell Pierre? Oh, yes. What a splendid man he is!â said Princess
 60642	Mary.
 60643	
 60644	âDo you know, Mary...â NatÃ¡sha suddenly said with a mischievous smile
 60645	such as Princess Mary had not seen on her face for a long time, âhe has
 60646	somehow grown so clean, smooth, and freshâas if he had just come out of
 60647	a Russian bath; do you understand? Out of a moral bath. Isnât it true?â
 60648	
 60649	âYes,â replied Princess Mary. âHe has greatly improved.â
 60650	
 60651	âWith a short coat and his hair cropped; just as if, well, just as if he
 60652	had come straight from the bath... Papa used to...â
 60653	
 60654	âI understand why heâ (Prince Andrew) âliked no one so much as him,â
 60655	said Princess Mary.
 60656	
 60657	âYes, and yet he is quite different. They say men are friends when they
 60658	are quite different. That must be true. Really he is quite unlike himâin
 60659	everything.â
 60660	
 60661	âYes, but heâs wonderful.â
 60662	
 60663	âWell, good night,â said NatÃ¡sha.
 60664	
 60665	And the same mischievous smile lingered for a long time on her face as
 60666	if it had been forgotten there.
 60667	
 60668	
 60669	
 60670	
 60671	
 60672	CHAPTER XVIII
 60673	
 60674	It was a long time before Pierre could fall asleep that night. He paced
 60675	up and down his room, now turning his thoughts on a difficult problem
 60676	and frowning, now suddenly shrugging his shoulders and wincing, and now
 60677	smiling happily.
 60678	
 60679	He was thinking of Prince Andrew, of NatÃ¡sha, and of their love, at one
 60680	moment jealous of her past, then reproaching himself for that feeling.
 60681	It was already six in the morning and he still paced up and down the
 60682	room.
 60683	
 60684	âWell, whatâs to be done if it cannot be avoided? Whatâs to be done?
 60685	Evidently it has to be so,â said he to himself, and hastily undressing
 60686	he got into bed, happy and agitated but free from hesitation or
 60687	indecision.
 60688	
 60689	âStrange and impossible as such happiness seems, I must do everything
 60690	that she and I may be man and wife,â he told himself.
 60691	
 60692	A few days previously Pierre had decided to go to Petersburg on the
 60693	Friday. When he awoke on the Thursday, SavÃ©lich came to ask him about
 60694	packing for the journey.
 60695	
 60696	âWhat, to Petersburg? What is Petersburg? Who is there in Petersburg?â
 60697	he asked involuntarily, though only to himself. âOh, yes, long ago
 60698	before this happened I did for some reason mean to go to Petersburg,â
 60699	he reflected. âWhy? But perhaps I shall go. What a good fellow he is and
 60700	how attentive, and how he remembers everything,â he thought, looking at
 60701	SavÃ©lichâs old face, âand what a pleasant smile he has!â
 60702	
 60703	âWell, SavÃ©lich, do you still not wish to accept your freedom?â Pierre
 60704	asked him.
 60705	
 60706	âWhatâs the good of freedom to me, your excellency? We lived under the
 60707	late countâthe kingdom of heaven be his!âand we have lived under you
 60708	too, without ever being wronged.â
 60709	
 60710	âAnd your children?â
 60711	
 60712	âThe children will live just the same. With such masters one can live.â
 60713	
 60714	âBut what about my heirs?â said Pierre. âSupposing I suddenly marry...
 60715	it might happen,â he added with an involuntary smile.
 60716	
 60717	âIf I may take the liberty, your excellency, it would be a good thing.â
 60718	
 60719	âHow easy he thinks it,â thought Pierre. âHe doesnât know how terrible
 60720	it is and how dangerous. Too soon or too late... it is terrible!â
 60721	
 60722	âSo what are your orders? Are you starting tomorrow?â asked SavÃ©lich.
 60723	
 60724	âNo, Iâll put it off for a bit. Iâll tell you later. You must forgive
 60725	the trouble I have put you to,â said Pierre, and seeing SavÃ©lich smile,
 60726	he thought: âBut how strange it is that he should not know that now
 60727	there is no Petersburg for me, and that that must be settled first of
 60728	all! But probably he knows it well enough and is only pretending. Shall
 60729	I have a talk with him and see what he thinks?â Pierre reflected. âNo,
 60730	another time.â
 60731	
 60732	At breakfast Pierre told the princess, his cousin, that he had been to
 60733	see Princess Mary the day before and had there metââWhom do you think?
 60734	NatÃ¡sha RostÃ³va!â
 60735	
 60736	The princess seemed to see nothing more extraordinary in that than if he
 60737	had seen Anna SemÃ«novna.
 60738	
 60739	âDo you know her?â asked Pierre.
 60740	
 60741	âI have seen the princess,â she replied. âI heard that they were
 60742	arranging a match for her with young RostÃ³v. It would be a very good
 60743	thing for the RostÃ³vs, they are said to be utterly ruined.â
 60744	
 60745	âNo; I mean do you know NatÃ¡sha RostÃ³va?â
 60746	
 60747	âI heard about that affair of hers at the time. It was a great pity.â
 60748	
 60749	âNo, she either doesnât understand or is pretending,â thought Pierre.
 60750	âBetter not say anything to her either.â
 60751	
 60752	The princess too had prepared provisions for Pierreâs journey.
 60753	
 60754	âHow kind they all are,â thought Pierre. âWhat is surprising is that
 60755	they should trouble about these things now when it can no longer be of
 60756	interest to them. And all for me!â
 60757	
 60758	On the same day the Chief of Police came to Pierre, inviting him to send
 60759	a representative to the Faceted Palace to recover things that were to be
 60760	returned to their owners that day.
 60761	
 60762	âAnd this man too,â thought Pierre, looking into the face of the Chief
 60763	of Police. âWhat a fine, good-looking officer and how kind. Fancy
 60764	bothering about such trifles now! And they actually say he is not honest
 60765	and takes bribes. What nonsense! Besides, why shouldnât he take bribes?
 60766	Thatâs the way he was brought up, and everybody does it. But what a
 60767	kind, pleasant face and how he smiles as he looks at me.â
 60768	
 60769	Pierre went to Princess Maryâs to dinner.
 60770	
 60771	As he drove through the streets past the houses that had been burned
 60772	down, he was surprised by the beauty of those ruins. The picturesqueness
 60773	of the chimney stacks and tumble-down walls of the burned-out quarters
 60774	of the town, stretching out and concealing one another, reminded him of
 60775	the Rhine and the Colosseum. The cabmen he met and their passengers,
 60776	the carpenters cutting the timber for new houses with axes, the women
 60777	hawkers, and the shopkeepers, all looked at him with cheerful beaming
 60778	eyes that seemed to say: âAh, there he is! Letâs see what will come of
 60779	it!â
 60780	
 60781	At the entrance to Princess Maryâs house Pierre felt doubtful whether
 60782	he had really been there the night before and really seen NatÃ¡sha and
 60783	talked to her. âPerhaps I imagined it; perhaps I shall go in and find
 60784	no one there.â But he had hardly entered the room before he felt her
 60785	presence with his whole being by the loss of his sense of freedom. She
 60786	was in the same black dress with soft folds and her hair was done the
 60787	same way as the day before, yet she was quite different. Had she been
 60788	like this when he entered the day before he could not for a moment have
 60789	failed to recognize her.
 60790	
 60791	She was as he had known her almost as a child and later on as Prince
 60792	Andrewâs fiancÃ©e. A bright questioning light shone in her eyes, and on
 60793	her face was a friendly and strangely roguish expression.
 60794	
 60795	Pierre dined with them and would have spent the whole evening there, but
 60796	Princess Mary was going to vespers and Pierre left the house with her.
 60797	
 60798	Next day he came early, dined, and stayed the whole evening. Though
 60799	Princess Mary and NatÃ¡sha were evidently glad to see their visitor and
 60800	though all Pierreâs interest was now centered in that house, by the
 60801	evening they had talked over everything and the conversation passed from
 60802	one trivial topic to another and repeatedly broke off. He stayed so long
 60803	that Princess Mary and NatÃ¡sha exchanged glances, evidently wondering
 60804	when he would go. Pierre noticed this but could not go. He felt uneasy
 60805	and embarrassed, but sat on because he simply could not get up and take
 60806	his leave.
 60807	
 60808	Princess Mary, foreseeing no end to this, rose first, and complaining of
 60809	a headache began to say good night.
 60810	
 60811	âSo you are going to Petersburg tomorrow?â she asked.
 60812	
 60813	âNo, I am not going,â Pierre replied hastily, in a surprised tone and as
 60814	though offended. âYes... no... to Petersburg? Tomorrowâbut I wonât say
 60815	good-by yet. I will call round in case you have any commissions for me,â
 60816	said he, standing before Princess Mary and turning red, but not taking
 60817	his departure.
 60818	
 60819	NatÃ¡sha gave him her hand and went out. Princess Mary on the other hand
 60820	instead of going away sank into an armchair, and looked sternly and
 60821	intently at him with her deep, radiant eyes. The weariness she
 60822	had plainly shown before had now quite passed off. With a deep and
 60823	long-drawn sigh she seemed to be prepared for a lengthy talk.
 60824	
 60825	When NatÃ¡sha left the room Pierreâs confusion and awkwardness
 60826	immediately vanished and were replaced by eager excitement. He quickly
 60827	moved an armchair toward Princess Mary.
 60828	
 60829	âYes, I wanted to tell you,â said he, answering her look as if she had
 60830	spoken. âPrincess, help me! What am I to do? Can I hope? Princess, my
 60831	dear friend, listen! I know it all. I know I am not worthy of her, I
 60832	know itâs impossible to speak of it now. But I want to be a brother to
 60833	her. No, not that, I donât, I canât...â
 60834	
 60835	He paused and rubbed his face and eyes with his hands.
 60836	
 60837	âWell,â he went on with an evident effort at self-control and coherence.
 60838	âI donât know when I began to love her, but I have loved her and her
 60839	alone all my life, and I love her so that I cannot imagine life without
 60840	her. I cannot propose to her at present, but the thought that
 60841	perhaps she might someday be my wife and that I may be missing that
 60842	possibility... that possibility... is terrible. Tell me, can I hope?
 60843	Tell me what I am to do, dear princess!â he added after a pause, and
 60844	touched her hand as she did not reply.
 60845	
 60846	âI am thinking of what you have told me,â answered Princess Mary.
 60847	âThis is what I will say. You are right that to speak to her of love at
 60848	present...â
 60849	
 60850	Princess Mary stopped. She was going to say that to speak of love was
 60851	impossible, but she stopped because she had seen by the sudden change
 60852	in NatÃ¡sha two days before that she would not only not be hurt if Pierre
 60853	spoke of his love, but that it was the very thing she wished for.
 60854	
 60855	âTo speak to her now wouldnât do,â said the princess all the same.
 60856	
 60857	âBut what am I to do?â
 60858	
 60859	âLeave it to me,â said Princess Mary. âI know...â
 60860	
 60861	Pierre was looking into Princess Maryâs eyes.
 60862	
 60863	âWell?... Well?...â he said.
 60864	
 60865	âI know that she loves... will love you,â Princess Mary corrected
 60866	herself.
 60867	
 60868	Before her words were out, Pierre had sprung up and with a frightened
 60869	expression seized Princess Maryâs hand.
 60870	
 60871	âWhat makes you think so? You think I may hope? You think...?â
 60872	
 60873	âYes, I think so,â said Princess Mary with a smile. âWrite to her
 60874	parents, and leave it to me. I will tell her when I can. I wish it to
 60875	happen and my heart tells me it will.â
 60876	
 60877	âNo, it cannot be! How happy I am! But it canât be.... How happy I am!
 60878	No, it canât be!â Pierre kept saying as he kissed Princess Maryâs hands.
 60879	
 60880	âGo to Petersburg, that will be best. And I will write to you,â she
 60881	said.
 60882	
 60883	âTo Petersburg? Go there? Very well, Iâll go. But I may come again
 60884	tomorrow?â
 60885	
 60886	Next day Pierre came to say good-by. NatÃ¡sha was less animated than
 60887	she had been the day before; but that day as he looked at her Pierre
 60888	sometimes felt as if he was vanishing and that neither he nor she
 60889	existed any longer, that nothing existed but happiness. âIs it possible?
 60890	No, it canât be,â he told himself at every look, gesture, and word that
 60891	filled his soul with joy.
 60892	
 60893	When on saying good-by he took her thin, slender hand, he could not help
 60894	holding it a little longer in his own.
 60895	
 60896	âIs it possible that this hand, that face, those eyes, all this treasure
 60897	of feminine charm so strange to me now, is it possible that it will one
 60898	day be mine forever, as familiar to me as I am to myself?... No, thatâs
 60899	impossible!...â
 60900	
 60901	âGood-by, Count,â she said aloud. âI shall look forward very much to
 60902	your return,â she added in a whisper.
 60903	
 60904	And these simple words, her look, and the expression on her face which
 60905	accompanied them, formed for two months the subject of inexhaustible
 60906	memories, interpretations, and happy meditations for Pierre. ââI shall
 60907	look forward very much to your return....â Yes, yes, how did she say it?
 60908	Yes, âI shall look forward very much to your return.â Oh, how happy I
 60909	am! What is happening to me? How happy I am!â said Pierre to himself.
 60910	
 60911	
 60912	
 60913	
 60914	
 60915	CHAPTER XIX
 60916	
 60917	There was nothing in Pierreâs soul now at all like what had troubled it
 60918	during his courtship of HÃ©lÃ¨ne.
 60919	
 60920	He did not repeat to himself with a sickening feeling of shame the words
 60921	he had spoken, or say: âOh, why did I not say that?â and, âWhatever made
 60922	me say âJe vous aimeâ?â On the contrary, he now repeated in imagination
 60923	every word that he or NatÃ¡sha had spoken and pictured every detail of
 60924	her face and smile, and did not wish to diminish or add anything, but
 60925	only to repeat it again and again. There was now not a shadow of doubt
 60926	in his mind as to whether what he had undertaken was right or wrong.
 60927	Only one terrible doubt sometimes crossed his mind: âWasnât it all
 60928	a dream? Isnât Princess Mary mistaken? Am I not too conceited and
 60929	self-confident? I believe all thisâand suddenly Princess Mary will tell
 60930	her, and she will be sure to smile and say: âHow strange! He must be
 60931	deluding himself. Doesnât he know that he is a man, just a man, while
 60932	I...? I am something altogether different and higher.ââ
 60933	
 60934	That was the only doubt often troubling Pierre. He did not now make any
 60935	plans. The happiness before him appeared so inconceivable that if only
 60936	he could attain it, it would be the end of all things. Everything ended
 60937	with that.
 60938	
 60939	A joyful, unexpected frenzy, of which he had thought himself incapable,
 60940	possessed him. The whole meaning of lifeânot for him alone but for the
 60941	whole worldâseemed to him centered in his love and the possibility of
 60942	being loved by her. At times everybody seemed to him to be occupied with
 60943	one thing onlyâhis future happiness. Sometimes it seemed to him that
 60944	other people were all as pleased as he was himself and merely tried to
 60945	hide that pleasure by pretending to be busy with other interests. In
 60946	every word and gesture he saw allusions to his happiness. He often
 60947	surprised those he met by his significantly happy looks and smiles which
 60948	seemed to express a secret understanding between him and them. And when
 60949	he realized that people might not be aware of his happiness, he pitied
 60950	them with his whole heart and felt a desire somehow to explain to them
 60951	that all that occupied them was a mere frivolous trifle unworthy of
 60952	attention.
 60953	
 60954	When it was suggested to him that he should enter the civil service,
 60955	or when the war or any general political affairs were discussed on the
 60956	assumption that everybodyâs welfare depended on this or that issue
 60957	of events, he would listen with a mild and pitying smile and surprise
 60958	people by his strange comments. But at this time he saw everybodyâboth
 60959	those who, as he imagined, understood the real meaning of life (that
 60960	is, what he was feeling) and those unfortunates who evidently did not
 60961	understand itâin the bright light of the emotion that shone within
 60962	himself, and at once without any effort saw in everyone he met
 60963	everything that was good and worthy of being loved.
 60964	
 60965	When dealing with the affairs and papers of his dead wife, her memory
 60966	aroused in him no feeling but pity that she had not known the bliss he
 60967	now knew. Prince VasÃ­li, who having obtained a new post and some
 60968	fresh decorations was particularly proud at this time, seemed to him a
 60969	pathetic, kindly old man much to be pitied.
 60970	
 60971	Often in afterlife Pierre recalled this period of blissful insanity. All
 60972	the views he formed of men and circumstances at this time remained true
 60973	for him always. He not only did not renounce them subsequently, but when
 60974	he was in doubt or inwardly at variance, he referred to the views he had
 60975	held at this time of his madness and they always proved correct.
 60976	
 60977	âI may have appeared strange and queer then,â he thought, âbut I was
 60978	not so mad as I seemed. On the contrary I was then wiser and had
 60979	more insight than at any other time, and understood all that is worth
 60980	understanding in life, because... because I was happy.â
 60981	
 60982	Pierreâs insanity consisted in not waiting, as he used to do, to
 60983	discover personal attributes which he termed âgood qualitiesâ in people
 60984	before loving them; his heart was now overflowing with love, and by
 60985	loving people without cause he discovered indubitable causes for loving
 60986	them.
 60987	
 60988	
 60989	
 60990	
 60991	
 60992	CHAPTER XX
 60993	
 60994	After Pierreâs departure that first evening, when NatÃ¡sha had said to
 60995	Princess Mary with a gaily mocking smile: âHe looks just, yes, just as
 60996	if he had come out of a Russian bathâin a short coat and with his hair
 60997	cropped,â something hidden and unknown to herself, but irrepressible,
 60998	awoke in NatÃ¡shaâs soul.
 60999	
 61000	Everything: her face, walk, look, and voice, was suddenly altered.
 61001	To her own surprise a power of life and hope of happiness rose to the
 61002	surface and demanded satisfaction. From that evening she seemed to have
 61003	forgotten all that had happened to her. She no longer complained of her
 61004	position, did not say a word about the past, and no longer feared to
 61005	make happy plans for the future. She spoke little of Pierre, but when
 61006	Princess Mary mentioned him a long-extinguished light once more kindled
 61007	in her eyes and her lips curved with a strange smile.
 61008	
 61009	The change that took place in NatÃ¡sha at first surprised Princess Mary;
 61010	but when she understood its meaning it grieved her. âCan she have loved
 61011	my brother so little as to be able to forget him so soon?â she thought
 61012	when she reflected on the change. But when she was with NatÃ¡sha she was
 61013	not vexed with her and did not reproach her. The reawakened power
 61014	of life that had seized NatÃ¡sha was so evidently irrepressible and
 61015	unexpected by her that in her presence Princess Mary felt that she had
 61016	no right to reproach her even in her heart.
 61017	
 61018	NatÃ¡sha gave herself up so fully and frankly to this new feeling that
 61019	she did not try to hide the fact that she was no longer sad, but bright
 61020	and cheerful.
 61021	
 61022	When Princess Mary returned to her room after her nocturnal talk with
 61023	Pierre, NatÃ¡sha met her on the threshold.
 61024	
 61025	âHe has spoken? Yes? He has spoken?â she repeated.
 61026	
 61027	And a joyful yet pathetic expression which seemed to beg forgiveness for
 61028	her joy settled on NatÃ¡shaâs face.
 61029	
 61030	âI wanted to listen at the door, but I knew you would tell me.â
 61031	
 61032	Understandable and touching as the look with which NatÃ¡sha gazed at
 61033	her seemed to Princess Mary, and sorry as she was to see her agitation,
 61034	these words pained her for a moment. She remembered her brother and his
 61035	love.
 61036	
 61037	âBut whatâs to be done? She canât help it,â thought the princess.
 61038	
 61039	And with a sad and rather stern look she told NatÃ¡sha all that Pierre
 61040	had said. On hearing that he was going to Petersburg NatÃ¡sha was
 61041	astounded.
 61042	
 61043	âTo Petersburg!â she repeated as if unable to understand.
 61044	
 61045	But noticing the grieved expression on Princess Maryâs face she guessed
 61046	the reason of that sadness and suddenly began to cry.
 61047	
 61048	âMary,â said she, âtell me what I should do! I am afraid of being bad.
 61049	Whatever you tell me, I will do. Tell me....â
 61050	
 61051	âYou love him?â
 61052	
 61053	âYes,â whispered NatÃ¡sha.
 61054	
 61055	âThen why are you crying? I am happy for your sake,â said Princess Mary,
 61056	who because of those tears quite forgave NatÃ¡shaâs joy.
 61057	
 61058	âIt wonât be just yetâsomeday. Think what fun it will be when I am his
 61059	wife and you marry Nicholas!â
 61060	
 61061	âNatÃ¡sha, I have asked you not to speak of that. Let us talk about you.â
 61062	
 61063	They were silent awhile.
 61064	
 61065	âBut why go to Petersburg?â NatÃ¡sha suddenly asked, and hastily replied
 61066	to her own question. âBut no, no, he must... Yes, Mary, He must....â
 61067

 61077	
 61078	CHAPTER I
 61079	
 61080	Seven years had passed. The storm-tossed sea of European history had
 61081	subsided within its shores and seemed to have become calm. But the
 61082	mysterious forces that move humanity (mysterious because the laws of
 61083	their motion are unknown to us) continued to operate.
 61084	
 61085	Though the surface of the sea of history seemed motionless, the movement
 61086	of humanity went on as unceasingly as the flow of time. Various groups
 61087	of people formed and dissolved, the coming formation and dissolution of
 61088	kingdoms and displacement of peoples was in course of preparation.
 61089	
 61090	The sea of history was not driven spasmodically from shore to shore as
 61091	previously. It was seething in its depths. Historic figures were not
 61092	borne by the waves from one shore to another as before. They now seemed
 61093	to rotate on one spot. The historical figures at the head of armies,
 61094	who formerly reflected the movement of the masses by ordering wars,
 61095	campaigns, and battles, now reflected the restless movement by political
 61096	and diplomatic combinations, laws, and treaties.
 61097	
 61098	The historians call this activity of the historical figures âthe
 61099	reaction.â
 61100	
 61101	In dealing with this period they sternly condemn the historical
 61102	personages who, in their opinion, caused what they describe as the
 61103	reaction. All the well-known people of that period, from Alexander and
 61104	Napoleon to Madame de StaÃ«l, Photius, Schelling, Fichte, Chateaubriand,
 61105	and the rest, pass before their stern judgment seat and are acquitted or
 61106	condemned according to whether they conduced to progress or to reaction.
 61107	
 61108	According to their accounts a reaction took place at that time in Russia
 61109	also, and the chief culprit was Alexander I, the same man who according
 61110	to them was the chief cause of the liberal movement at the commencement
 61111	of his reign, being the savior of Russia.
 61112	
 61113	There is no one in Russian literature now, from schoolboy essayist to
 61114	learned historian, who does not throw his little stone at Alexander for
 61115	things he did wrong at this period of his reign.
 61116	
 61117	âHe ought to have acted in this way and in that way. In this case he did
 61118	well and in that case badly. He behaved admirably at the beginning of
 61119	his reign and during 1812, but acted badly by giving a constitution
 61120	to Poland, forming the Holy Alliance, entrusting power to ArakchÃ©ev,
 61121	favoring GolÃ­tsyn and mysticism, and afterwards ShishkÃ³v and Photius.
 61122	He also acted badly by concerning himself with the active army and
 61123	disbanding the SemÃ«nov regiment.â
 61124	
 61125	It would take a dozen pages to enumerate all the reproaches the
 61126	historians address to him, based on their knowledge of what is good for
 61127	humanity.
 61128	
 61129	What do these reproaches mean?
 61130	
 61131	Do not the very actions for which the historians praise Alexander I
 61132	(the liberal attempts at the beginning of his reign, his struggle with
 61133	Napoleon, the firmness he displayed in 1812 and the campaign of 1813)
 61134	flow from the same sourcesâthe circumstances of his birth, education,
 61135	and lifeâthat made his personality what it was and from which the
 61136	actions for which they blame him (the Holy Alliance, the restoration of
 61137	Poland, and the reaction of 1820 and later) also flowed?
 61138	
 61139	In what does the substance of those reproaches lie?
 61140	
 61141	It lies in the fact that an historic character like Alexander I,
 61142	standing on the highest possible pinnacle of human power with the
 61143	blinding light of history focused upon him; a character exposed to those
 61144	strongest of all influences: the intrigues, flattery, and self-deception
 61145	inseparable from power; a character who at every moment of his life
 61146	felt a responsibility for all that was happening in Europe; and not
 61147	a fictitious but a live character who like every man had his personal
 61148	habits, passions, and impulses toward goodness, beauty, and truthâthat
 61149	this characterâthough not lacking in virtue (the historians do not
 61150	accuse him of that)âhad not the same conception of the welfare of
 61151	humanity fifty years ago as a present-day professor who from his
 61152	youth upwards has been occupied with learning: that is, with books and
 61153	lectures and with taking notes from them.
 61154	
 61155	But even if we assume that fifty years ago Alexander I was mistaken in
 61156	his view of what was good for the people, we must inevitably assume that
 61157	the historian who judges Alexander will also after the lapse of some
 61158	time turn out to be mistaken in his view of what is good for humanity.
 61159	This assumption is all the more natural and inevitable because, watching
 61160	the movement of history, we see that every year and with each new
 61161	writer, opinion as to what is good for mankind changes; so that what
 61162	once seemed good, ten years later seems bad, and vice versa. And what is
 61163	more, we find at one and the same time quite contradictory views as to
 61164	what is bad and what is good in history: some people regard giving a
 61165	constitution to Poland and forming the Holy Alliance as praiseworthy in
 61166	Alexander, while others regard it as blameworthy.
 61167	
 61168	The activity of Alexander or of Napoleon cannot be called useful or
 61169	harmful, for it is impossible to say for what it was useful or harmful.
 61170	If that activity displeases somebody, this is only because it does
 61171	not agree with his limited understanding of what is good. Whether the
 61172	preservation of my fatherâs house in Moscow, or the glory of the Russian
 61173	arms, or the prosperity of the Petersburg and other universities, or the
 61174	freedom of Poland or the greatness of Russia, or the balance of power in
 61175	Europe, or a certain kind of European culture called âprogressâ appear
 61176	to me to be good or bad, I must admit that besides these things the
 61177	action of every historic character has other more general purposes
 61178	inaccessible to me.
 61179	
 61180	But let us assume that what is called science can harmonize all
 61181	contradictions and possesses an unchanging standard of good and bad by
 61182	which to try historic characters and events; let us say that Alexander
 61183	could have done everything differently; let us say that with guidance
 61184	from those who blame him and who profess to know the ultimate aim of the
 61185	movement of humanity, he might have arranged matters according to
 61186	the program his present accusers would have given himâof nationality,
 61187	freedom, equality, and progress (these, I think, cover the ground). Let
 61188	us assume that this program was possible and had then been formulated,
 61189	and that Alexander had acted on it. What would then have become of the
 61190	activity of all those who opposed the tendency that then prevailed in
 61191	the governmentâan activity that in the opinion of the historians was
 61192	good and beneficent? Their activity would not have existed: there would
 61193	have been no life, there would have been nothing.
 61194	
 61195	If we admit that human life can be ruled by reason, the possibility of
 61196	life is destroyed.
 61197	
 61198	
 61199	
 61200	
 61201	
 61202	CHAPTER II
 61203	
 61204	If we assume as the historians do that great men lead humanity to the
 61205	attainment of certain endsâthe greatness of Russia or of France,
 61206	the balance of power in Europe, the diffusion of the ideas of the
 61207	Revolution, general progress, or anything elseâthen it is impossible
 61208	to explain the facts of history without introducing the conceptions of
 61209	chance and genius.
 61210	
 61211	If the aim of the European wars at the beginning of the nineteenth
 61212	century had been the aggrandizement of Russia, that aim might have been
 61213	accomplished without all the preceding wars and without the invasion. If
 61214	the aim was the aggrandizement of France, that might have been attained
 61215	without the Revolution and without the Empire. If the aim was the
 61216	dissemination of ideas, the printing press could have accomplished that
 61217	much better than warfare. If the aim was the progress of civilization,
 61218	it is easy to see that there are other ways of diffusing civilization
 61219	more expedient than by the destruction of wealth and of human lives.
 61220	
 61221	Why did it happen in this and not in some other way?
 61222	
 61223	Because it happened so! âChance created the situation; genius utilized
 61224	it,â says history.
 61225	
 61226	But what is chance? What is genius?
 61227	
 61228	The words chance and genius do not denote any really existing thing and
 61229	therefore cannot be defined. Those words only denote a certain stage of
 61230	understanding of phenomena. I do not know why a certain event occurs; I
 61231	think that I cannot know it; so I do not try to know it and I talk about
 61232	chance. I see a force producing effects beyond the scope of ordinary
 61233	human agencies; I do not understand why this occurs and I talk of
 61234	genius.
 61235	
 61236	To a herd of rams, the ram the herdsman drives each evening into a
 61237	special enclosure to feed and that becomes twice as fat as the others
 61238	must seem to be a genius. And it must appear an astonishing conjunction
 61239	of genius with a whole series of extraordinary chances that this ram,
 61240	who instead of getting into the general fold every evening goes into a
 61241	special enclosure where there are oatsâthat this very ram, swelling with
 61242	fat, is killed for meat.
 61243	
 61244	But the rams need only cease to suppose that all that happens to them
 61245	happens solely for the attainment of their sheepish aims; they need only
 61246	admit that what happens to them may also have purposes beyond their ken,
 61247	and they will at once perceive a unity and coherence in what happened
 61248	to the ram that was fattened. Even if they do not know for what purpose
 61249	they are fattened, they will at least know that all that happened to the
 61250	ram did not happen accidentally, and will no longer need the conceptions
 61251	of chance or genius.
 61252	
 61253	Only by renouncing our claim to discern a purpose immediately
 61254	intelligible to us, and admitting the ultimate purpose to be beyond our
 61255	ken, may we discern the sequence of experiences in the lives of
 61256	historic characters and perceive the cause of the effect they produce
 61257	(incommensurable with ordinary human capabilities), and then the words
 61258	chance and genius become superfluous.
 61259	
 61260	We need only confess that we do not know the purpose of the European
 61261	convulsions and that we know only the factsâthat is, the murders, first
 61262	in France, then in Italy, in Africa, in Prussia, in Austria, in Spain,
 61263	and in Russiaâand that the movements from the west to the east and from
 61264	the east to the west form the essence and purpose of these events, and
 61265	not only shall we have no need to see exceptional ability and genius in
 61266	Napoleon and Alexander, but we shall be unable to consider them to
 61267	be anything but like other men, and we shall not be obliged to have
 61268	recourse to chance for an explanation of those small events which made
 61269	these people what they were, but it will be clear that all those small
 61270	events were inevitable.
 61271	
 61272	By discarding a claim to knowledge of the ultimate purpose, we shall
 61273	clearly perceive that just as one cannot imagine a blossom or seed for
 61274	any single plant better suited to it than those it produces, so it is
 61275	impossible to imagine any two people more completely adapted down to the
 61276	smallest detail for the purpose they had to fulfill, than Napoleon and
 61277	Alexander with all their antecedents.
 61278	
 61279	
 61280	
 61281	
 61282	
 61283	CHAPTER III
 61284	
 61285	The fundamental and essential significance of the European events of the
 61286	beginning of the nineteenth century lies in the movement of the mass of
 61287	the European peoples from west to east and afterwards from east to west.
 61288	The commencement of that movement was the movement from west to east.
 61289	For the peoples of the west to be able to make their warlike movement
 61290	to Moscow it was necessary: (1) that they should form themselves into
 61291	a military group of a size able to endure a collision with the warlike
 61292	military group of the east, (2) that they should abandon all established
 61293	traditions and customs, and (3) that during their military movement they
 61294	should have at their head a man who could justify to himself and to them
 61295	the deceptions, robberies, and murders which would have to be committed
 61296	during that movement.
 61297	
 61298	And beginning with the French Revolution the old inadequately large
 61299	group was destroyed, as well as the old habits and traditions, and step
 61300	by step a group was formed of larger dimensions with new customs and
 61301	traditions, and a man was produced who would stand at the head of the
 61302	coming movement and bear the responsibility for all that had to be done.
 61303	
 61304	A man without convictions, without habits, without traditions, without
 61305	a name, and not even a Frenchman, emergesâby what seem the strangest
 61306	chancesâfrom among all the seething French parties, and without joining
 61307	any one of them is borne forward to a prominent position.
 61308	
 61309	The ignorance of his colleagues, the weakness and insignificance of
 61310	his opponents, the frankness of his falsehoods, and the dazzling and
 61311	self-confident limitations of this man raise him to the head of the
 61312	army. The brilliant qualities of the soldiers of the army sent to Italy,
 61313	his opponentsâ reluctance to fight, and his own childish audacity and
 61314	self-confidence secure him military fame. Innumerable so-called chances
 61315	accompany him everywhere. The disfavor into which he falls with the
 61316	rulers of France turns to his advantage. His attempts to avoid his
 61317	predestined path are unsuccessful: he is not received into the Russian
 61318	service, and the appointment he seeks in Turkey comes to nothing. During
 61319	the war in Italy he is several times on the verge of destruction and
 61320	each time is saved in an unexpected manner. Owing to various diplomatic
 61321	considerations the Russian armiesâjust those which might have destroyed
 61322	his prestigeâdo not appear upon the scene till he is no longer there.
 61323	
 61324	On his return from Italy he finds the government in Paris in a process
 61325	of dissolution in which all those who are in it are inevitably wiped
 61326	out and destroyed. And by chance an escape from this dangerous position
 61327	presents itself in the form of an aimless and senseless expedition
 61328	to Africa. Again so-called chance accompanies him. Impregnable Malta
 61329	surrenders without a shot; his most reckless schemes are crowned with
 61330	success. The enemyâs fleet, which subsequently did not let a single boat
 61331	pass, allows his entire army to elude it. In Africa a whole series of
 61332	outrages are committed against the almost unarmed inhabitants. And the
 61333	men who commit these crimes, especially their leader, assure themselves
 61334	that this is admirable, this is gloryâit resembles Caesar and Alexander
 61335	the Great and is therefore good.
 61336	
 61337	This ideal of glory and grandeurâwhich consists not merely in
 61338	considering nothing wrong that one does but in priding oneself on every
 61339	crime one commits, ascribing to it an incomprehensible supernatural
 61340	significanceâthat ideal, destined to guide this man and his associates,
 61341	had scope for its development in Africa. Whatever he does succeeds. The
 61342	plague does not touch him. The cruelty of murdering prisoners is not
 61343	imputed to him as a fault. His childishly rash, uncalled-for, and
 61344	ignoble departure from Africa, leaving his comrades in distress, is
 61345	set down to his credit, and again the enemyâs fleet twice lets him slip
 61346	past. When, intoxicated by the crimes he has committed so successfully,
 61347	he reaches Paris, the dissolution of the republican government, which a
 61348	year earlier might have ruined him, has reached its extreme limit, and
 61349	his presence there now as a newcomer free from party entanglements can
 61350	only serve to exalt himâand though he himself has no plan, he is quite
 61351	ready for his new rÃ´le.
 61352	
 61353	He had no plan, he was afraid of everything, but the parties snatched at
 61354	him and demanded his participation.
 61355	
 61356	He aloneâwith his ideal of glory and grandeur developed in Italy and
 61357	Egypt, his insane self-adulation, his boldness in crime and frankness in
 61358	lyingâhe alone could justify what had to be done.
 61359	
 61360	He is needed for the place that awaits him, and so almost apart from
 61361	his will and despite his indecision, his lack of a plan, and all his
 61362	mistakes, he is drawn into a conspiracy that aims at seizing power and
 61363	the conspiracy is crowned with success.
 61364	
 61365	He is pushed into a meeting of the legislature. In alarm he wishes to
 61366	flee, considering himself lost. He pretends to fall into a swoon and
 61367	says senseless things that should have ruined him. But the once proud
 61368	and shrewd rulers of France, feeling that their part is played out, are
 61369	even more bewildered than he, and do not say the words they should have
 61370	said to destroy him and retain their power.
 61371	
 61372	Chance, millions of chances, give him power, and all men as if by
 61373	agreement co-operate to confirm that power. Chance forms the characters
 61374	of the rulers of France, who submit to him; chance forms the character
 61375	of Paul I of Russia who recognizes his government; chance contrives
 61376	a plot against him which not only fails to harm him but confirms his
 61377	power. Chance puts the Duc dâEnghien in his hands and unexpectedly
 61378	causes him to kill himâthereby convincing the mob more forcibly than
 61379	in any other way that he had the right, since he had the might.
 61380	Chance contrives that though he directs all his efforts to prepare an
 61381	expedition against England (which would inevitably have ruined him) he
 61382	never carries out that intention, but unexpectedly falls upon Mack and
 61383	the Austrians, who surrender without a battle. Chance and genius give
 61384	him the victory at Austerlitz; and by chance all men, not only the
 61385	French but all Europeâexcept England which does not take part in the
 61386	events about to happenâdespite their former horror and detestation of
 61387	his crimes, now recognize his authority, the title he has given
 61388	himself, and his ideal of grandeur and glory, which seems excellent and
 61389	reasonable to them all.
 61390	
 61391	As if measuring themselves and preparing for the coming movement, the
 61392	western forces push toward the east several times in 1805, 1806, 1807,
 61393	and 1809, gaining strength and growing. In 1811 the group of people that
 61394	had formed in France unites into one group with the peoples of Central
 61395	Europe. The strength of the justification of the man who stands at the
 61396	head of the movement grows with the increased size of the group. During
 61397	the ten-year preparatory period this man had formed relations with all
 61398	the crowned heads of Europe. The discredited rulers of the world can
 61399	oppose no reasonable ideal to the insensate Napoleonic ideal of
 61400	glory and grandeur. One after another they hasten to display their
 61401	insignificance before him. The King of Prussia sends his wife to seek
 61402	the great manâs mercy; the Emperor of Austria considers it a favor that
 61403	this man receives a daughter of the Caesars into his bed; the Pope, the
 61404	guardian of all that the nations hold sacred, utilizes religion for the
 61405	aggrandizement of the great man. It is not Napoleon who prepares himself
 61406	for the accomplishment of his role, so much as all those round him who
 61407	prepare him to take on himself the whole responsibility for what is
 61408	happening and has to happen. There is no step, no crime or petty fraud
 61409	he commits, which in the mouths of those around him is not at once
 61410	represented as a great deed. The most suitable fÃªte the Germans can
 61411	devise for him is a celebration of Jena and AuerstÃ¤dt. Not only is he
 61412	great, but so are his ancestors, his brothers, his stepsons, and his
 61413	brothers-in-law. Everything is done to deprive him of the remains of his
 61414	reason and to prepare him for his terrible part. And when he is ready so
 61415	too are the forces.
 61416	
 61417	The invasion pushes eastward and reaches its final goalâMoscow. That
 61418	city is taken; the Russian army suffers heavier losses than the opposing
 61419	armies had suffered in the former war from Austerlitz to Wagram. But
 61420	suddenly instead of those chances and that genius which hitherto had
 61421	so consistently led him by an uninterrupted series of successes to the
 61422	predestined goal, an innumerable sequence of inverse chances occurâfrom
 61423	the cold in his head at BorodinÃ³ to the sparks which set Moscow on
 61424	fire, and the frostsâand instead of genius, stupidity and immeasurable
 61425	baseness become evident.
 61426	
 61427	The invaders flee, turn back, flee again, and all the chances are now
 61428	not for Napoleon but always against him.
 61429	
 61430	A countermovement is then accomplished from east to west with a
 61431	remarkable resemblance to the preceding movement from west to east.
 61432	Attempted drives from east to westâsimilar to the contrary movements of
 61433	1805, 1807, and 1809âprecede the great westward movement; there is the
 61434	same coalescence into a group of enormous dimensions; the same adhesion
 61435	of the people of Central Europe to the movement; the same hesitation
 61436	midway, and the same increasing rapidity as the goal is approached.
 61437	
 61438	Paris, the ultimate goal, is reached. The Napoleonic government and army
 61439	are destroyed. Napoleon himself is no longer of any account; all his
 61440	actions are evidently pitiful and mean, but again an inexplicable chance
 61441	occurs. The allies detest Napoleon whom they regard as the cause of
 61442	their sufferings. Deprived of power and authority, his crimes and his
 61443	craft exposed, he should have appeared to them what he appeared ten
 61444	years previously and one year laterâan outlawed brigand. But by some
 61445	strange chance no one perceives this. His part is not yet ended. The man
 61446	who ten years before and a year later was considered an outlawed brigand
 61447	is sent to an island two daysâ sail from France, which for some reason
 61448	is presented to him as his dominion, and guards are given to him and
 61449	millions of money are paid him.
 61450	
 61451	
 61452	
 61453	
 61454	
 61455	CHAPTER IV
 61456	
 61457	The flood of nations begins to subside into its normal channels. The
 61458	waves of the great movement abate, and on the calm surface eddies are
 61459	formed in which float the diplomatists, who imagine that they have
 61460	caused the floods to abate.
 61461	
 61462	But the smooth sea again suddenly becomes disturbed. The diplomatists
 61463	think that their disagreements are the cause of this fresh pressure
 61464	of natural forces; they anticipate war between their sovereigns; the
 61465	position seems to them insoluble. But the wave they feel to be rising
 61466	does not come from the quarter they expect. It rises again from the same
 61467	point as beforeâParis. The last backwash of the movement from the west
 61468	occurs: a backwash which serves to solve the apparently insuperable
 61469	diplomatic difficulties and ends the military movement of that period of
 61470	history.
 61471	
 61472	The man who had devastated France returns to France alone, without any
 61473	conspiracy and without soldiers. Any guard might arrest him, but by
 61474	strange chance no one does so and all rapturously greet the man they
 61475	cursed the day before and will curse again a month later.
 61476	
 61477	This man is still needed to justify the final collective act.
 61478	
 61479	That act is performed.
 61480	
 61481	The last rÃ´le is played. The actor is bidden to disrobe and wash off his
 61482	powder and paint: he will not be wanted any more.
 61483	
 61484	And some years pass during which he plays a pitiful comedy to himself
 61485	in solitude on his island, justifying his actions by intrigues and lies
 61486	when the justification is no longer needed, and displaying to the whole
 61487	world what it was that people had mistaken for strength as long as an
 61488	unseen hand directed his actions.
 61489	
 61490	The manager having brought the drama to a close and stripped the actor
 61491	shows him to us.
 61492	
 61493	âSee what you believed in! This is he! Do you now see that it was not he
 61494	but I who moved you?â
 61495	
 61496	But dazed by the force of the movement, it was long before people
 61497	understood this.
 61498	
 61499	Still greater coherence and inevitability is seen in the life of
 61500	Alexander I, the man who stood at the head of the countermovement from
 61501	east to west.
 61502	
 61503	What was needed for him who, overshadowing others, stood at the head of
 61504	that movement from east to west?
 61505	
 61506	What was needed was a sense of justice and a sympathy with European
 61507	affairs, but a remote sympathy not dulled by petty interests; a moral
 61508	superiority over those sovereigns of the day who co-operated with him;
 61509	a mild and attractive personality; and a personal grievance against
 61510	Napoleon. And all this was found in Alexander I; all this had been
 61511	prepared by innumerable so-called chances in his life: his education,
 61512	his early liberalism, the advisers who surrounded him, and by
 61513	Austerlitz, and Tilsit, and Erfurt.
 61514	
 61515	During the national war he was inactive because he was not needed. But
 61516	as soon as the necessity for a general European war presented itself he
 61517	appeared in his place at the given moment and, uniting the nations of
 61518	Europe, led them to the goal.
 61519	
 61520	The goal is reached. After the final war of 1815 Alexander possesses all
 61521	possible power. How does he use it?
 61522	
 61523	Alexander Iâthe pacifier of Europe, the man who from his early years
 61524	had striven only for his peopleâs welfare, the originator of the liberal
 61525	innovations in his fatherlandânow that he seemed to possess the utmost
 61526	power and therefore to have the possibility of bringing about the
 61527	welfare of his peoplesâat the time when Napoleon in exile was drawing
 61528	up childish and mendacious plans of how he would have made mankind happy
 61529	had he retained powerâAlexander I, having fulfilled his mission and
 61530	feeling the hand of God upon him, suddenly recognizes the insignificance
 61531	of that supposed power, turns away from it, and gives it into the hands
 61532	of contemptible men whom he despises, saying only:
 61533	
 61534	âNot unto us, not unto us, but unto Thy Name!... I too am a man like the
 61535	rest of you. Let me live like a man and think of my soul and of God.â
 61536	
 61537	As the sun and each atom of ether is a sphere complete in itself, and
 61538	yet at the same time only a part of a whole too immense for man to
 61539	comprehend, so each individual has within himself his own aims and yet
 61540	has them to serve a general purpose incomprehensible to man.
 61541	
 61542	A bee settling on a flower has stung a child. And the child is afraid
 61543	of bees and declares that bees exist to sting people. A poet admires the
 61544	bee sucking from the chalice of a flower and says it exists to suck the
 61545	fragrance of flowers. A beekeeper, seeing the bee collect pollen from
 61546	flowers and carry it to the hive, says that it exists to gather honey.
 61547	Another beekeeper who has studied the life of the hive more closely
 61548	says that the bee gathers pollen dust to feed the young bees and rear
 61549	a queen, and that it exists to perpetuate its race. A botanist notices
 61550	that the bee flying with the pollen of a male flower to a pistil
 61551	fertilizes the latter, and sees in this the purpose of the beeâs
 61552	existence. Another, observing the migration of plants, notices that the
 61553	bee helps in this work, and may say that in this lies the purpose of the
 61554	bee. But the ultimate purpose of the bee is not exhausted by the first,
 61555	the second, or any of the processes the human mind can discern. The
 61556	higher the human intellect rises in the discovery of these purposes,
 61557	the more obvious it becomes, that the ultimate purpose is beyond our
 61558	comprehension.
 61559	
 61560	All that is accessible to man is the relation of the life of the bee to
 61561	other manifestations of life. And so it is with the purpose of historic
 61562	characters and nations.

 61568	CHAPTER V
 61569	
 61570	NatÃ¡shaâs wedding to BezÃºkhov, which took place in 1813, was the last
 61571	happy event in the family of the old RostÃ³vs. Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v died
 61572	that same year and, as always happens, after the fatherâs death the
 61573	family group broke up.
 61574	
 61575	The events of the previous year: the burning of Moscow and the flight
 61576	from it, the death of Prince Andrew, NatÃ¡shaâs despair, PÃ©tyaâs death,
 61577	and the old countessâ grief fell blow after blow on the old countâs
 61578	head. He seemed to be unable to understand the meaning of all these
 61579	events, and bowed his old head in a spiritual sense as if expecting and
 61580	inviting further blows which would finish him. He seemed now frightened
 61581	and distraught and now unnaturally animated and enterprising.
 61582	
 61583	The arrangements for NatÃ¡shaâs marriage occupied him for a while. He
 61584	ordered dinners and suppers and obviously tried to appear cheerful, but
 61585	his cheerfulness was not infectious as it used to be: on the contrary it
 61586	evoked the compassion of those who knew and liked him.
 61587	
 61588	When Pierre and his wife had left, he grew very quiet and began to
 61589	complain of depression. A few days later he fell ill and took to his
 61590	bed. He realized from the first that he would not get up again, despite
 61591	the doctorâs encouragement. The countess passed a fortnight in an
 61592	armchair by his pillow without undressing. Every time she gave him
 61593	his medicine he sobbed and silently kissed her hand. On his last day,
 61594	sobbing, he asked her and his absent son to forgive him for having
 61595	dissipated their propertyâthat being the chief fault of which he was
 61596	conscious. After receiving communion and unction he quietly died; and
 61597	next day a throng of acquaintances who came to pay their last respects
 61598	to the deceased filled the house rented by the RostÃ³vs. All these
 61599	acquaintances, who had so often dined and danced at his house and had so
 61600	often laughed at him, now said, with a common feeling of self-reproach
 61601	and emotion, as if justifying themselves: âWell, whatever he may have
 61602	been he was a most worthy man. You donât meet such men nowadays.... And
 61603	which of us has not weaknesses of his own?â
 61604	
 61605	It was just when the countâs affairs had become so involved that it was
 61606	impossible to say what would happen if he lived another year that he
 61607	unexpectedly died.
 61608	
 61609	Nicholas was with the Russian army in Paris when the news of his
 61610	fatherâs death reached him. He at once resigned his commission, and
 61611	without waiting for it to be accepted took leave of absence and went to
 61612	Moscow. The state of the countâs affairs became quite obvious a month
 61613	after his death, surprising everyone by the immense total of small
 61614	debts the existence of which no one had suspected. The debts amounted to
 61615	double the value of the property.
 61616	
 61617	Friends and relations advised Nicholas to decline the inheritance. But
 61618	he regarded such a refusal as a slur on his fatherâs memory, which he
 61619	held sacred, and therefore would not hear of refusing and accepted the
 61620	inheritance together with the obligation to pay the debts.
 61621	
 61622	The creditors who had so long been silent, restrained by a vague
 61623	but powerful influence exerted on them while he lived by the countâs
 61624	careless good nature, all proceeded to enforce their claims at once. As
 61625	always happens in such cases rivalry sprang up as to which should get
 61626	paid first, and those who like MÃ­tenka held promissory notes given them
 61627	as presents now became the most exacting of the creditors. Nicholas was
 61628	allowed no respite and no peace, and those who had seemed to pity
 61629	the old manâthe cause of their losses (if they were losses)ânow
 61630	remorselessly pursued the young heir who had voluntarily undertaken the
 61631	debts and was obviously not guilty of contracting them.
 61632	
 61633	Not one of the plans Nicholas tried succeeded; the estate was sold by
 61634	auction for half its value, and half the debts still remained
 61635	unpaid. Nicholas accepted thirty thousand rubles offered him by his
 61636	brother-in-law BezÃºkhov to pay off debts he regarded as genuinely due
 61637	for value received. And to avoid being imprisoned for the remainder, as
 61638	the creditors threatened, he re-entered the government service.
 61639	
 61640	He could not rejoin the army where he would have been made colonel at
 61641	the next vacancy, for his mother now clung to him as her one hold on
 61642	life; and so despite his reluctance to remain in Moscow among people who
 61643	had known him before, and despite his abhorrence of the civil service,
 61644	he accepted a post in Moscow in that service, doffed the uniform of
 61645	which he was so fond, and moved with his mother and SÃ³nya to a small
 61646	house on the SÃ­vtsev VrazhÃ³k.
 61647	
 61648	NatÃ¡sha and Pierre were living in Petersburg at the time and had no
 61649	clear idea of Nicholasâ circumstances. Having borrowed money from his
 61650	brother-in-law, Nicholas tried to hide his wretched condition from him.
 61651	His position was the more difficult because with his salary of twelve
 61652	hundred rubles he had not only to keep himself, his mother, and SÃ³nya,
 61653	but had to shield his mother from knowledge of their poverty. The
 61654	countess could not conceive of life without the luxurious conditions she
 61655	had been used to from childhood and, unable to realize how hard it was
 61656	for her son, kept demanding now a carriage (which they did not keep) to
 61657	send for a friend, now some expensive article of food for herself, or
 61658	wine for her son, or money to buy a present as a surprise for NatÃ¡sha or
 61659	SÃ³nya, or for Nicholas himself.
 61660	
 61661	SÃ³nya kept house, attended on her aunt, read to her, put up with her
 61662	whims and secret ill-will, and helped Nicholas to conceal their poverty
 61663	from the old countess. Nicholas felt himself irredeemably indebted
 61664	to SÃ³nya for all she was doing for his mother and greatly admired her
 61665	patience and devotion, but tried to keep aloof from her.
 61666	
 61667	He seemed in his heart to reproach her for being too perfect, and
 61668	because there was nothing to reproach her with. She had all that people
 61669	are valued for, but little that could have made him love her. He felt
 61670	that the more he valued her the less he loved her. He had taken her at
 61671	her word when she wrote giving him his freedom and now behaved as if all
 61672	that had passed between them had been long forgotten and could never in
 61673	any case be renewed.
 61674	
 61675	Nicholasâ position became worse and worse. The idea of putting something
 61676	aside out of his salary proved a dream. Not only did he not save
 61677	anything, but to comply with his motherâs demands he even incurred some
 61678	small debts. He could see no way out of this situation. The idea of
 61679	marrying some rich woman, which was suggested to him by his female
 61680	relations, was repugnant to him. The other way outâhis motherâs
 61681	deathânever entered his head. He wished for nothing and hoped
 61682	for nothing, and deep in his heart experienced a gloomy and stern
 61683	satisfaction in an uncomplaining endurance of his position. He tried
 61684	to avoid his old acquaintances with their commiseration and offensive
 61685	offers of assistance; he avoided all distraction and recreation, and
 61686	even at home did nothing but play cards with his mother, pace silently
 61687	up and down the room, and smoke one pipe after another. He seemed
 61688	carefully to cherish within himself the gloomy mood which alone enabled
 61689	him to endure his position.
 61690	
 61691	
 61692	
 61693	
 61694	
 61695	CHAPTER VI
 61696	
 61697	At the beginning of winter Princess Mary came to Moscow. From reports
 61698	current in town she learned how the RostÃ³vs were situated, and how âthe
 61699	son has sacrificed himself for his mother,â as people were saying.
 61700	
 61701	âI never expected anything else of him,â said Princess Mary to herself,
 61702	feeling a joyous sense of her love for him. Remembering her friendly
 61703	relations with all the RostÃ³vs which had made her almost a member of the
 61704	family, she thought it her duty to go to see them. But remembering her
 61705	relations with Nicholas in VorÃ³nezh she was shy about doing so. Making
 61706	a great effort she did however go to call on them a few weeks after her
 61707	arrival in Moscow.
 61708	
 61709	Nicholas was the first to meet her, as the countessâ room could only be
 61710	reached through his. But instead of being greeted with pleasure as she
 61711	had expected, at his first glance at her his face assumed a cold, stiff,
 61712	proud expression she had not seen on it before. He inquired about her
 61713	health, led the way to his mother, and having sat there for five minutes
 61714	left the room.
 61715	
 61716	When the princess came out of the countessâ room Nicholas met her again,
 61717	and with marked solemnity and stiffness accompanied her to the anteroom.
 61718	To her remarks about his motherâs health he made no reply. âWhatâs that
 61719	to you? Leave me in peace,â his looks seemed to say.
 61720	
 61721	âWhy does she come prowling here? What does she want? I canât bear these
 61722	ladies and all these civilities!â said he aloud in SÃ³nyaâs presence,
 61723	evidently unable to repress his vexation, after the princessâ carriage
 61724	had disappeared.
 61725	
 61726	âOh, Nicholas, how can you talk like that?â cried SÃ³nya, hardly able to
 61727	conceal her delight. âShe is so kind and Mamma is so fond of her!â
 61728	
 61729	Nicholas did not reply and tried to avoid speaking of the princess any
 61730	more. But after her visit the old countess spoke of her several times a
 61731	day.
 61732	
 61733	She sang her praises, insisted that her son must call on her, expressed
 61734	a wish to see her often, but yet always became ill-humored when she
 61735	began to talk about her.
 61736	
 61737	Nicholas tried to keep silence when his mother spoke of the princess,
 61738	but his silence irritated her.
 61739	
 61740	âShe is a very admirable and excellent young woman,â said she, âand you
 61741	must go and call on her. You would at least be seeing somebody, and I
 61742	think it must be dull for you only seeing us.â
 61743	
 61744	âBut I donât in the least want to, Mamma.â
 61745	
 61746	âYou used to want to, and now you donât. Really I donât understand you,
 61747	my dear. One day you are dull, and the next you refuse to see anyone.â
 61748	
 61749	âBut I never said I was dull.â
 61750	
 61751	âWhy, you said yourself you donât want even to see her. She is a very
 61752	admirable young woman and you always liked her, but now suddenly you
 61753	have got some notion or other in your head. You hide everything from
 61754	me.â
 61755	
 61756	âNot at all, Mamma.â
 61757	
 61758	âIf I were asking you to do something disagreeable nowâbut I only ask
 61759	you to return a call. One would think mere politeness required it....
 61760	Well, I have asked you, and now I wonât interfere any more since you
 61761	have secrets from your mother.â
 61762	
 61763	âWell, then, Iâll go if you wish it.â
 61764	
 61765	âIt doesnât matter to me. I only wish it for your sake.â
 61766	
 61767	Nicholas sighed, bit his mustache, and laid out the cards for a
 61768	patience, trying to divert his motherâs attention to another topic.
 61769	
 61770	The same conversation was repeated next day and the day after, and the
 61771	day after that.
 61772	
 61773	After her visit to the RostÃ³vs and her unexpectedly chilly reception by
 61774	Nicholas, Princess Mary confessed to herself that she had been right in
 61775	not wishing to be the first to call.
 61776	
 61777	âI expected nothing else,â she told herself, calling her pride to her
 61778	aid. âI have nothing to do with him and I only wanted to see the
 61779	old lady, who was always kind to me and to whom I am under many
 61780	obligations.â
 61781	
 61782	But she could not pacify herself with these reflections; a feeling akin
 61783	to remorse troubled her when she thought of her visit. Though she had
 61784	firmly resolved not to call on the RostÃ³vs again and to forget the whole
 61785	matter, she felt herself all the time in an awkward position. And when
 61786	she asked herself what distressed her, she had to admit that it was her
 61787	relation to RostÃ³v. His cold, polite manner did not express his feeling
 61788	for her (she knew that) but it concealed something, and until she could
 61789	discover what that something was, she felt that she could not be at
 61790	ease.
 61791	
 61792	One day in midwinter when sitting in the schoolroom attending to her
 61793	nephewâs lessons, she was informed that RostÃ³v had called. With a firm
 61794	resolution not to betray herself and not show her agitation, she sent
 61795	for Mademoiselle Bourienne and went with her to the drawing room.
 61796	
 61797	Her first glance at Nicholasâ face told her that he had only come to
 61798	fulfill the demands of politeness, and she firmly resolved to maintain
 61799	the tone in which he addressed her.
 61800	
 61801	They spoke of the countessâ health, of their mutual friends, of the
 61802	latest war news, and when the ten minutes required by propriety had
 61803	elapsed after which a visitor may rise, Nicholas got up to say good-by.
 61804	
 61805	With Mademoiselle Bourienneâs help the princess had maintained the
 61806	conversation very well, but at the very last moment, just when he rose,
 61807	she was so tired of talking of what did not interest her, and her
 61808	mind was so full of the question why she alone was granted so little
 61809	happiness in life, that in a fit of absent-mindedness she sat still, her
 61810	luminous eyes gazing fixedly before her, not noticing that he had risen.
 61811	
 61812	Nicholas glanced at her and, wishing to appear not to notice her
 61813	abstraction, made some remark to Mademoiselle Bourienne and then
 61814	again looked at the princess. She still sat motionless with a look of
 61815	suffering on her gentle face. He suddenly felt sorry for her and was
 61816	vaguely conscious that he might be the cause of the sadness her face
 61817	expressed. He wished to help her and say something pleasant, but could
 61818	think of nothing to say.
 61819	
 61820	âGood-by, Princess!â said he.
 61821	
 61822	She started, flushed, and sighed deeply.
 61823	
 61824	âOh, I beg your pardon,â she said as if waking up. âAre you going
 61825	already, Count? Well then, good-by! Oh, but the cushion for the
 61826	countess!â
 61827	
 61828	âWait a moment, Iâll fetch it,â said Mademoiselle Bourienne, and she
 61829	left the room.
 61830	
 61831	They both sat silent, with an occasional glance at one another.
 61832	
 61833	âYes, Princess,â said Nicholas at last with a sad smile, âit doesnât
 61834	seem long ago since we first met at BoguchÃ¡rovo, but how much water
 61835	has flowed since then! In what distress we all seemed to be then, yet
 61836	I would give much to bring back that time... but thereâs no bringing it
 61837	back.â
 61838	
 61839	Princess Mary gazed intently into his eyes with her own luminous ones
 61840	as he said this. She seemed to be trying to fathom the hidden meaning of
 61841	his words which would explain his feeling for her.
 61842	
 61843	âYes, yes,â said she, âbut you have no reason to regret the past, Count.
 61844	As I understand your present life, I think you will always recall it
 61845	with satisfaction, because the self-sacrifice that fills it now...â
 61846	
 61847	âI cannot accept your praise,â he interrupted her hurriedly. âOn the
 61848	contrary I continually reproach myself.... But this is not at all an
 61849	interesting or cheerful subject.â
 61850	
 61851	His face again resumed its former stiff and cold expression. But the
 61852	princess had caught a glimpse of the man she had known and loved, and it
 61853	was to him that she now spoke.
 61854	
 61855	âI thought you would allow me to tell you this,â she said. âI had come
 61856	so near to you... and to all your family that I thought you would not
 61857	consider my sympathy misplaced, but I was mistaken,â and suddenly her
 61858	voice trembled. âI donât know why,â she continued, recovering herself,
 61859	âbut you used to be different, and...â
 61860	
 61861	âThere are a thousand reasons why,â laying special emphasis on the why.
 61862	âThank you, Princess,â he added softly. âSometimes it is hard.â
 61863	
 61864	âSo thatâs why! Thatâs why!â a voice whispered in Princess Maryâs soul.
 61865	âNo, it was not only that gay, kind, and frank look, not only that
 61866	handsome exterior, that I loved in him. I divined his noble, resolute,
 61867	self-sacrificing spirit too,â she said to herself. âYes, he is poor now
 61868	and I am rich.... Yes, thatâs the only reason.... Yes, were it not for
 61869	that...â And remembering his former tenderness, and looking now at his
 61870	kind, sorrowful face, she suddenly understood the cause of his coldness.
 61871	
 61872	âBut why, Count, why?â she almost cried, unconsciously moving closer to
 61873	him. âWhy? Tell me. You must tell me!â
 61874	
 61875	He was silent.
 61876	
 61877	âI donât understand your why, Count,â she continued, âbut itâs hard for
 61878	me... I confess it. For some reason you wish to deprive me of our former
 61879	friendship. And that hurts me.â There were tears in her eyes and in her
 61880	voice. âI have had so little happiness in life that every loss is hard
 61881	for me to bear.... Excuse me, good-by!â and suddenly she began to cry
 61882	and was hurrying from the room.
 61883	
 61884	âPrincess, for Godâs sake!â he exclaimed, trying to stop her.
 61885	âPrincess!â
 61886	
 61887	She turned round. For a few seconds they gazed silently into one
 61888	anotherâs eyesâand what had seemed impossible and remote suddenly became
 61889	possible, inevitable, and very near.
 61890	
 61891	
 61892	
 61893	
 61894	
 61895	CHAPTER VII
 61896	
 61897	In the winter of 1813 Nicholas married Princess Mary and moved to Bald
 61898	Hills with his wife, his mother, and SÃ³nya.
 61899	
 61900	Within four years he had paid off all his remaining debts without
 61901	selling any of his wifeâs property, and having received a small
 61902	inheritance on the death of a cousin he paid his debt to Pierre as well.
 61903	
 61904	In another three years, by 1820, he had so managed his affairs that he
 61905	was able to buy a small estate adjoining Bald Hills and was negotiating
 61906	to buy back OtrÃ¡dnoeâthat being his pet dream.
 61907	
 61908	Having started farming from necessity, he soon grew so devoted to it
 61909	that it became his favorite and almost his sole occupation. Nicholas was
 61910	a plain farmer: he did not like innovations, especially the English ones
 61911	then coming into vogue. He laughed at theoretical treatises on estate
 61912	management, disliked factories, the raising of expensive products,
 61913	and the buying of expensive seed corn, and did not make a hobby of any
 61914	particular part of the work on his estate. He always had before his
 61915	mindâs eye the estate as a whole and not any particular part of it. The
 61916	chief thing in his eyes was not the nitrogen in the soil, nor the oxygen
 61917	in the air, nor manures, nor special plows, but that most important
 61918	agent by which nitrogen, oxygen, manure, and plow were made
 61919	effectiveâthe peasant laborer. When Nicholas first began farming
 61920	and began to understand its different branches, it was the serf who
 61921	especially attracted his attention. The peasant seemed to him not merely
 61922	a tool, but also a judge of farming and an end in himself. At first
 61923	he watched the serfs, trying to understand their aims and what they
 61924	considered good and bad, and only pretended to direct them and give
 61925	orders while in reality learning from them their methods, their manner
 61926	of speech, and their judgment of what was good and bad. Only when he
 61927	had understood the peasantsâ tastes and aspirations, had learned to talk
 61928	their language, to grasp the hidden meaning of their words, and felt
 61929	akin to them did he begin boldly to manage his serfs, that is, to
 61930	perform toward them the duties demanded of him. And Nicholasâ management
 61931	produced very brilliant results.
 61932	
 61933	Guided by some gift of insight, on taking up the management of the
 61934	estates he at once unerringly appointed as bailiff, village elder, and
 61935	delegate, the very men the serfs would themselves have chosen had they
 61936	had the right to choose, and these posts never changed hands. Before
 61937	analyzing the properties of manure, before entering into the debit and
 61938	credit (as he ironically called it), he found out how many cattle the
 61939	peasants had and increased the number by all possible means. He kept the
 61940	peasant families together in the largest groups possible, not allowing
 61941	the family groups to divide into separate households. He was hard alike
 61942	on the lazy, the depraved, and the weak, and tried to get them expelled
 61943	from the commune.
 61944	
 61945	He was as careful of the sowing and reaping of the peasantsâ hay
 61946	and corn as of his own, and few landowners had their crops sown
 61947	and harvested so early and so well, or got so good a return, as did
 61948	Nicholas.
 61949	
 61950	He disliked having anything to do with the domestic serfsâthe âdronesâ
 61951	as he called themâand everyone said he spoiled them by his laxity. When
 61952	a decision had to be taken regarding a domestic serf, especially if one
 61953	had to be punished, he always felt undecided and consulted everybody in
 61954	the house; but when it was possible to have a domestic serf conscripted
 61955	instead of a land worker he did so without the least hesitation. He
 61956	never felt any hesitation in dealing with the peasants. He knew that his
 61957	every decision would be approved by them all with very few exceptions.
 61958	
 61959	He did not allow himself either to be hard on or punish a man, or to
 61960	make things easy for or reward anyone, merely because he felt inclined
 61961	to do so. He could not have said by what standard he judged what he
 61962	should or should not do, but the standard was quite firm and definite in
 61963	his own mind.
 61964	
 61965	Often, speaking with vexation of some failure or irregularity, he would
 61966	say: âWhat can one do with our Russian peasants?â and imagined that he
 61967	could not bear them.
 61968	
 61969	Yet he loved âour Russian peasantsâ and their way of life with his whole
 61970	soul, and for that very reason had understood and assimilated the one
 61971	way and manner of farming which produced good results.
 61972	
 61973	Countess Mary was jealous of this passion of her husbandâs and regretted
 61974	that she could not share it; but she could not understand the joys and
 61975	vexations he derived from that world, to her so remote and alien. She
 61976	could not understand why he was so particularly animated and happy
 61977	when, after getting up at daybreak and spending the whole morning in the
 61978	fields or on the threshing floor, he returned from the sowing or mowing
 61979	or reaping to have tea with her. She did not understand why he spoke
 61980	with such admiration and delight of the farming of the thrifty and
 61981	well-to-do peasant Matthew ErmÃ­shin, who with his family had carted
 61982	corn all night; or of the fact that his (Nicholasâ) sheaves were already
 61983	stacked before anyone else had his harvest in. She did not understand
 61984	why he stepped out from the window to the veranda and smiled under his
 61985	mustache and winked so joyfully, when warm steady rain began to fall
 61986	on the dry and thirsty shoots of the young oats, or why when the wind
 61987	carried away a threatening cloud during the hay harvest he would return
 61988	from the barn, flushed, sunburned, and perspiring, with a smell of
 61989	wormwood and gentian in his hair and, gleefully rubbing his hands, would
 61990	say: âWell, one more day and my grain and the peasantsâ will all be
 61991	under cover.â
 61992	
 61993	Still less did she understand why he, kindhearted and always ready to
 61994	anticipate her wishes, should become almost desperate when she brought
 61995	him a petition from some peasant men or women who had appealed to her
 61996	to be excused some work; why he, that kind Nicholas, should obstinately
 61997	refuse her, angrily asking her not to interfere in what was not her
 61998	business. She felt he had a world apart, which he loved passionately and
 61999	which had laws she had not fathomed.
 62000	
 62001	Sometimes when, trying to understand him, she spoke of the good work he
 62002	was doing for his serfs, he would be vexed and reply: âNot in the least;
 62003	it never entered my head and I wouldnât do that for their good! Thatâs
 62004	all poetry and old wivesâ talkâall that doing good to oneâs neighbor!
 62005	What I want is that our children should not have to go begging. I must
 62006	put our affairs in order while I am alive, thatâs all. And to do that,
 62007	order and strictness are essential.... Thatâs all about it!â said he,
 62008	clenching his vigorous fist. âAnd fairness, of course,â he added, âfor
 62009	if the peasant is naked and hungry and has only one miserable horse, he
 62010	can do no good either for himself or for me.â
 62011	
 62012	And all Nicholas did was fruitfulâprobably just because he refused to
 62013	allow himself to think that he was doing good to others for virtueâs
 62014	sake. His means increased rapidly; serfs from neighboring estates came
 62015	to beg him to buy them, and long after his death the memory of his
 62016	administration was devoutly preserved among the serfs. âHe was a
 62017	master... the peasantsâ affairs first and then his own. Of course he was
 62018	not to be trifled with eitherâin a word, he was a real master!â
 62019	
 62020	
 62021	
 62022	
 62023	
 62024	CHAPTER VIII
 62025	
 62026	One matter connected with his management sometimes worried Nicholas, and
 62027	that was his quick temper together with his old hussar habit of making
 62028	free use of his fists. At first he saw nothing reprehensible in
 62029	this, but in the second year of his marriage his view of that form of
 62030	punishment suddenly changed.
 62031	
 62032	Once in summer he had sent for the village elder from BoguchÃ¡rovo, a
 62033	man who had succeeded to the post when Dron died and who was accused of
 62034	dishonesty and various irregularities. Nicholas went out into the porch
 62035	to question him, and immediately after the elder had given a few replies
 62036	the sound of cries and blows were heard. On returning to lunch Nicholas
 62037	went up to his wife, who sat with her head bent low over her embroidery
 62038	frame, and as usual began to tell her what he had been doing that
 62039	morning. Among other things he spoke of the BoguchÃ¡rovo elder. Countess
 62040	Mary turned red and then pale, but continued to sit with head bowed and
 62041	lips compressed and gave her husband no reply.
 62042	
 62043	âSuch an insolent scoundrel!â he cried, growing hot again at the mere
 62044	recollection of him. âIf he had told me he was drunk and did not see...
 62045	But what is the matter with you, Mary?â he suddenly asked.
 62046	
 62047	Countess Mary raised her head and tried to speak, but hastily looked
 62048	down again and her lips puckered.
 62049	
 62050	âWhy, whatever is the matter, my dearest?â
 62051	
 62052	The looks of the plain Countess Mary always improved when she was in
 62053	tears. She never cried from pain or vexation, but always from sorrow or
 62054	pity, and when she wept her radiant eyes acquired an irresistible charm.
 62055	
 62056	The moment Nicholas took her hand she could no longer restrain herself
 62057	and began to cry.
 62058	
 62059	âNicholas, I saw it... he was to blame, but why do you... Nicholas!â and
 62060	she covered her face with her hands.
 62061	
 62062	Nicholas said nothing. He flushed crimson, left her side, and paced up
 62063	and down the room. He understood what she was weeping about, but could
 62064	not in his heart at once agree with her that what he had regarded
 62065	from childhood as quite an everyday event was wrong. âIs it just
 62066	sentimentality, old wivesâ tales, or is she right?â he asked himself.
 62067	Before he had solved that point he glanced again at her face filled with
 62068	love and pain, and he suddenly realized that she was right and that he
 62069	had long been sinning against himself.
 62070	
 62071	âMary,â he said softly, going up to her, âit will never happen again;
 62072	I give you my word. Never,â he repeated in a trembling voice like a boy
 62073	asking for forgiveness.
 62074	
 62075	The tears flowed faster still from the countessâ eyes. She took his hand
 62076	and kissed it.
 62077	
 62078	âNicholas, when did you break your cameo?â she asked to change the
 62079	subject, looking at his finger on which he wore a ring with a cameo of
 62080	LaocoÃ¶nâs head.
 62081	
 62082	âTodayâit was the same affair. Oh, Mary, donât remind me of it!â and
 62083	again he flushed. âI give you my word of honor it shanât occur again,
 62084	and let this always be a reminder to me,â and he pointed to the broken
 62085	ring.
 62086	
 62087	After that, when in discussions with his village elders or stewards the
 62088	blood rushed to his face and his fists began to clench, Nicholas would
 62089	turn the broken ring on his finger and would drop his eyes before the
 62090	man who was making him angry. But he did forget himself once or twice
 62091	within a twelvemonth, and then he would go and confess to his wife, and
 62092	would again promise that this should really be the very last time.
 62093	
 62094	âMary, you must despise me!â he would say. âI deserve it.â
 62095	
 62096	âYou should go, go away at once, if you donât feel strong enough to
 62097	control yourself,â she would reply sadly, trying to comfort her husband.
 62098	
 62099	Among the gentry of the province Nicholas was respected but not liked.
 62100	He did not concern himself with the interests of his own class, and
 62101	consequently some thought him proud and others thought him stupid. The
 62102	whole summer, from spring sowing to harvest, he was busy with the work
 62103	on his farm. In autumn he gave himself up to hunting with the same
 62104	business-like seriousnessâleaving home for a month, or even two, with
 62105	his hunt. In winter he visited his other villages or spent his time
 62106	reading. The books he read were chiefly historical, and on these he
 62107	spent a certain sum every year. He was collecting, as he said, a serious
 62108	library, and he made it a rule to read through all the books he bought.
 62109	He would sit in his study with a grave air, readingâa task he first
 62110	imposed upon himself as a duty, but which afterwards became a habit
 62111	affording him a special kind of pleasure and a consciousness of
 62112	being occupied with serious matters. In winter, except for business
 62113	excursions, he spent most of his time at home making himself one with
 62114	his family and entering into all the details of his childrenâs relations
 62115	with their mother. The harmony between him and his wife grew closer and
 62116	closer and he daily discovered fresh spiritual treasures in her.
 62117	
 62118	From the time of his marriage SÃ³nya had lived in his house. Before
 62119	that, Nicholas had told his wife all that had passed between himself and
 62120	SÃ³nya, blaming himself and commending her. He had asked Princess Mary to
 62121	be gentle and kind to his cousin. She thoroughly realized the wrong he
 62122	had done SÃ³nya, felt herself to blame toward her, and imagined that her
 62123	wealth had influenced Nicholasâ choice. She could not find fault with
 62124	SÃ³nya in any way and tried to be fond of her, but often felt ill-will
 62125	toward her which she could not overcome.
 62126	
 62127	Once she had a talk with her friend NatÃ¡sha about SÃ³nya and about her
 62128	own injustice toward her.
 62129	
 62130	âYou know,â said NatÃ¡sha, âyou have read the Gospels a great dealâthere
 62131	is a passage in them that just fits SÃ³nya.â
 62132	
 62133	âWhat?â asked Countess Mary, surprised.
 62134	
 62135	ââTo him that hath shall be given, and from him that hath not shall be
 62136	taken away.â You remember? She is one that hath not; why, I donât know.
 62137	Perhaps she lacks egotism, I donât know, but from her is taken away, and
 62138	everything has been taken away. Sometimes I am dreadfully sorry for her.
 62139	Formerly I very much wanted Nicholas to marry her, but I always had
 62140	a sort of presentiment that it would not come off. She is a sterile
 62141	flower, you knowâlike some strawberry blossoms. Sometimes I am sorry for
 62142	her, and sometimes I think she doesnât feel it as you or I would.â
 62143	
 62144	Though Countess Mary told NatÃ¡sha that those words in the Gospel must be
 62145	understood differently, yet looking at SÃ³nya she agreed with NatÃ¡shaâs
 62146	explanation. It really seemed that SÃ³nya did not feel her position
 62147	trying, and had grown quite reconciled to her lot as a sterile flower.
 62148	She seemed to be fond not so much of individuals as of the family as a
 62149	whole. Like a cat, she had attached herself not to the people but to the
 62150	home. She waited on the old countess, petted and spoiled the children,
 62151	was always ready to render the small services for which she had a gift,
 62152	and all this was unconsciously accepted from her with insufficient
 62153	gratitude.
 62154	
 62155	The country seat at Bald Hills had been rebuilt, though not on the same
 62156	scale as under the old prince.
 62157	
 62158	The buildings, begun under straitened circumstances, were more than
 62159	simple. The immense house on the old stone foundations was of wood,
 62160	plastered only inside. It had bare deal floors and was furnished with
 62161	very simple hard sofas, armchairs, tables, and chairs made by their own
 62162	serf carpenters out of their own birchwood. The house was spacious
 62163	and had rooms for the house serfs and apartments for visitors. Whole
 62164	families of the RostÃ³vsâ and BolkÃ³nskisâ relations sometimes came to
 62165	Bald Hills with sixteen horses and dozens of servants and stayed for
 62166	months. Besides that, four times a year, on the name days and birthdays
 62167	of the hosts, as many as a hundred visitors would gather there for a day
 62168	or two. The rest of the year life pursued its unbroken routine with its
 62169	ordinary occupations, and its breakfasts, lunches, dinners, and suppers,
 62170	provided out of the produce of the estate.
 62171	
 62172	
 62173	
 62174	
 62175	
 62176	CHAPTER IX
 62177	
 62178	It was the eve of St. Nicholas, the fifth of December, 1820. NatÃ¡sha had
 62179	been staying at her brotherâs with her husband and children since early
 62180	autumn. Pierre had gone to Petersburg on business of his own for three
 62181	weeks as he said, but had remained there nearly seven weeks and was
 62182	expected back every minute.
 62183	
 62184	Besides the BezÃºkhov family, Nicholasâ old friend the retired General
 62185	VasÃ­li DmÃ­trich DenÃ­sov was staying with the RostÃ³vs this fifth of
 62186	December.
 62187	
 62188	On the sixth, which was his name day when the house would be full of
 62189	visitors, Nicholas knew he would have to exchange his Tartar tunic for
 62190	a tail coat, and put on narrow boots with pointed toes, and drive to
 62191	the new church he had built, and then receive visitors who would come to
 62192	congratulate him, offer them refreshments, and talk about the elections
 62193	of the nobility; but he considered himself entitled to spend the eve
 62194	of that day in his usual way. He examined the bailiffâs accounts of
 62195	the village in RyazÃ¡n which belonged to his wifeâs nephew, wrote two
 62196	business letters, and walked over to the granaries, cattle yards and
 62197	stables before dinner. Having taken precautions against the general
 62198	drunkenness to be expected on the morrow because it was a great saintâs
 62199	day, he returned to dinner, and without having time for a private talk
 62200	with his wife sat down at the long table laid for twenty persons, at
 62201	which the whole household had assembled. At that table were his mother,
 62202	his motherâs old lady companion BelÃ³va, his wife, their three children
 62203	with their governess and tutor, his wifeâs nephew with his tutor, SÃ³nya,
 62204	DenÃ­sov, NatÃ¡sha, her three children, their governess, and old Michael
 62205	IvÃ¡novich, the late princeâs architect, who was living on in retirement
 62206	at Bald Hills.
 62207	
 62208	Countess Mary sat at the other end of the table. When her husband took
 62209	his place she concluded, from the rapid manner in which after taking
 62210	up his table napkin he pushed back the tumbler and wineglass standing
 62211	before him, that he was out of humor, as was sometimes the case when
 62212	he came in to dinner straight from the farmâespecially before the soup.
 62213	Countess Mary well knew that mood of his, and when she herself was in
 62214	a good frame of mind quietly waited till he had had his soup and then
 62215	began to talk to him and make him admit that there was no cause for his
 62216	ill-humor. But today she quite forgot that and was hurt that he should
 62217	be angry with her without any reason, and she felt unhappy. She asked
 62218	him where he had been. He replied. She again inquired whether
 62219	everything was going well on the farm. Her unnatural tone made him wince
 62220	unpleasantly and he replied hastily.
 62221	
 62222	âThen Iâm not mistaken,â thought Countess Mary. âWhy is he cross with
 62223	me?â She concluded from his tone that he was vexed with her and wished
 62224	to end the conversation. She knew her remarks sounded unnatural, but
 62225	could not refrain from asking some more questions.
 62226	
 62227	Thanks to DenÃ­sov the conversation at table soon became general and
 62228	lively, and she did not talk to her husband. When they left the table
 62229	and went as usual to thank the old countess, Countess Mary held out her
 62230	hand and kissed her husband, and asked him why he was angry with her.
 62231	
 62232	âYou always have such strange fancies! I didnât even think of being
 62233	angry,â he replied.
 62234	
 62235	But the word always seemed to her to imply: âYes, I am angry but I wonât
 62236	tell you why.â
 62237	
 62238	Nicholas and his wife lived together so happily that even SÃ³nya and the
 62239	old countess, who felt jealous and would have liked them to disagree,
 62240	could find nothing to reproach them with; but even they had their
 62241	moments of antagonism. Occasionally, and it was always just after they
 62242	had been happiest together, they suddenly had a feeling of estrangement
 62243	and hostility, which occurred most frequently during Countess Maryâs
 62244	pregnancies, and this was such a time.
 62245	
 62246	âWell, messieurs et mesdames,â said Nicholas loudly and with apparent
 62247	cheerfulness (it seemed to Countess Mary that he did it on purpose to
 62248	vex her), âI have been on my feet since six this morning. Tomorrow I
 62249	shall have to suffer, so today Iâll go and rest.â
 62250	
 62251	And without a word to his wife he went to the little sitting room and
 62252	lay down on the sofa.
 62253	
 62254	âThatâs always the way,â thought Countess Mary. âHe talks to everyone
 62255	except me. I see... I see that I am repulsive to him, especially when I
 62256	am in this condition.â She looked down at her expanded figure and in the
 62257	glass at her pale, sallow, emaciated face in which her eyes now looked
 62258	larger than ever.
 62259	
 62260	And everything annoyed herâDenÃ­sovâs shouting and laughter, NatÃ¡shaâs
 62261	talk, and especially a quick glance SÃ³nya gave her.
 62262	
 62263	SÃ³nya was always the first excuse Countess Mary found for feeling
 62264	irritated.
 62265	
 62266	Having sat awhile with her visitors without understanding anything of
 62267	what they were saying, she softly left the room and went to the nursery.
 62268	
 62269	The children were playing at âgoing to Moscowâ in a carriage made of
 62270	chairs and invited her to go with them. She sat down and played with
 62271	them a little, but the thought of her husband and his unreasonable
 62272	crossness worried her. She got up and, walking on tiptoe with
 62273	difficulty, went to the small sitting room.
 62274	
 62275	âPerhaps he is not asleep; Iâll have an explanation with him,â she
 62276	said to herself. Little Andrew, her eldest boy, imitating his mother,
 62277	followed her on tiptoe. She did not notice him.
 62278	
 62279	âMary, dear, I think he is asleepâhe was so tired,â said SÃ³nya, meeting
 62280	her in the large sitting room (it seemed to Countess Mary that she
 62281	crossed her path everywhere). âAndrew may wake him.â
 62282	
 62283	Countess Mary looked round, saw little Andrew following her, felt that
 62284	SÃ³nya was right, and for that very reason flushed and with evident
 62285	difficulty refrained from saying something harsh. She made no reply, but
 62286	to avoid obeying SÃ³nya beckoned to Andrew to follow her quietly and went
 62287	to the door. SÃ³nya went away by another door. From the room in which
 62288	Nicholas was sleeping came the sound of his even breathing, every
 62289	slightest tone of which was familiar to his wife. As she listened to it
 62290	she saw before her his smooth handsome forehead, his mustache, and his
 62291	whole face, as she had so often seen it in the stillness of the night
 62292	when he slept. Nicholas suddenly moved and cleared his throat. And at
 62293	that moment little Andrew shouted from outside the door: âPapa! Mammaâs
 62294	standing here!â Countess Mary turned pale with fright and made signs
 62295	to the boy. He grew silent, and quiet ensued for a moment, terrible to
 62296	Countess Mary. She knew how Nicholas disliked being waked. Then through
 62297	the door she heard Nicholas clearing his throat again and stirring, and
 62298	his voice said crossly:
 62299	
 62300	âI canât get a momentâs peace.... Mary, is that you? Why did you bring
 62301	him here?â
 62302	
 62303	âI only came in to look and did not notice... forgive me....â
 62304	
 62305	Nicholas coughed and said no more. Countess Mary moved away from the
 62306	door and took the boy back to the nursery. Five minutes later little
 62307	black-eyed three-year-old NatÃ¡sha, her fatherâs pet, having learned from
 62308	her brother that Papa was asleep and Mamma was in the sitting room, ran
 62309	to her father unobserved by her mother. The dark-eyed little girl boldly
 62310	opened the creaking door, went up to the sofa with energetic steps of
 62311	her sturdy little legs, and having examined the position of her father,
 62312	who was asleep with his back to her, rose on tiptoe and kissed the hand
 62313	which lay under his head. Nicholas turned with a tender smile on his
 62314	face.
 62315	
 62316	âNatÃ¡sha, NatÃ¡sha!â came Countess Maryâs frightened whisper from the
 62317	door. âPapa wants to sleep.â
 62318	
 62319	âNo, Mamma, he doesnât want to sleep,â said little NatÃ¡sha with
 62320	conviction. âHeâs laughing.â
 62321	
 62322	Nicholas lowered his legs, rose, and took his daughter in his arms.
 62323	
 62324	âCome in, Mary,â he said to his wife.
 62325	
 62326	She went in and sat down by her husband.
 62327	
 62328	âI did not notice him following me,â she said timidly. âI just looked
 62329	in.â
 62330	
 62331	Holding his little girl with one arm, Nicholas glanced at his wife and,
 62332	seeing her guilty expression, put his other arm around her and kissed
 62333	her hair.
 62334	
 62335	âMay I kiss Mamma?â he asked NatÃ¡sha.
 62336	
 62337	NatÃ¡sha smiled bashfully.
 62338	
 62339	âAgain!â she commanded, pointing with a peremptory gesture to the spot
 62340	where Nicholas had placed the kiss.
 62341	
 62342	âI donât know why you think I am cross,â said Nicholas, replying to the
 62343	question he knew was in his wifeâs mind.
 62344	
 62345	âYou have no idea how unhappy, how lonely, I feel when you are like
 62346	that. It always seems to me...â
 62347	
 62348	âMary, donât talk nonsense. You ought to be ashamed of yourself!â he
 62349	said gaily.
 62350	
 62351	âIt seems to be that you canât love me, that I am so plain... always...
 62352	and now... in this cond...â
 62353	
 62354	âOh, how absurd you are! It is not beauty that endears, itâs love that
 62355	makes us see beauty. It is only MalvÃ­nas and women of that kind who are
 62356	loved for their beauty. But do I love my wife? I donât love her, but...
 62357	I donât know how to put it. Without you, or when something comes between
 62358	us like this, I seem lost and canât do anything. Now do I love my
 62359	finger? I donât love it, but just try to cut it off!â
 62360	
 62361	âIâm not like that myself, but I understand. So youâre not angry with
 62362	me?â
 62363	
 62364	âAwfully angry!â he said, smiling and getting up. And smoothing his hair
 62365	he began to pace the room.
 62366	
 62367	âDo you know, Mary, what Iâve been thinking?â he began, immediately
 62368	thinking aloud in his wifeâs presence now that they had made it up.
 62369	
 62370	He did not ask if she was ready to listen to him. He did not care. A
 62371	thought had occurred to him and so it belonged to her also. And he told
 62372	her of his intention to persuade Pierre to stay with them till spring.
 62373	
 62374	Countess Mary listened till he had finished, made some remark, and in
 62375	her turn began thinking aloud. Her thoughts were about the children.
 62376	
 62377	âYou can see the woman in her already,â she said in French, pointing to
 62378	little NatÃ¡sha. âYou reproach us women with being illogical. Here is our
 62379	logic. I say: âPapa wants to sleep!â but she says, âNo, heâs laughing.â
 62380	And she was right,â said Countess Mary with a happy smile.
 62381	
 62382	âYes, yes.â And Nicholas, taking his little daughter in his strong hand,
 62383	lifted her high, placed her on his shoulder, held her by the legs, and
 62384	paced the room with her. There was an expression of carefree happiness
 62385	on the faces of both father and daughter.
 62386	
 62387	âBut you know you may be unfair. You are too fond of this one,â his wife
 62388	whispered in French.
 62389	
 62390	âYes, but what am I to do?... I try not to show...â
 62391	
 62392	At that moment they heard the sound of the door pulley and footsteps in
 62393	the hall and anteroom, as if someone had arrived.
 62394	
 62395	âSomebody has come.â
 62396	
 62397	âI am sure it is Pierre. I will go and see,â said Countess Mary and left
 62398	the room.
 62399	
 62400	In her absence Nicholas allowed himself to give his little daughter a
 62401	gallop round the room. Out of breath, he took the laughing child quickly
 62402	from his shoulder and pressed her to his heart. His capers reminded
 62403	him of dancing, and looking at the childâs round happy little face he
 62404	thought of what she would be like when he was an old man, taking her
 62405	into society and dancing the mazurka with her as his old father had
 62406	danced Daniel Cooper with his daughter.
 62407	
 62408	âIt is he, it is he, Nicholas!â said Countess Mary, re-entering the room
 62409	a few minutes later. âNow our NatÃ¡sha has come to life. You should have
 62410	seen her ecstasy, and how he caught it for having stayed away so long.
 62411	Well, come along now, quick, quick! Itâs time you two were parted,â she
 62412	added, looking smilingly at the little girl who clung to her father.
 62413	
 62414	Nicholas went out holding the child by the hand.
 62415	
 62416	Countess Mary remained in the sitting room.
 62417	
 62418	âI should never, never have believed that one could be so happy,â she
 62419	whispered to herself. A smile lit up her face but at the same time she
 62420	sighed, and her deep eyes expressed a quiet sadness as though she
 62421	felt, through her happiness, that there is another sort of happiness
 62422	unattainable in this life and of which she involuntarily thought at that
 62423	instant.
 62424	
 62425	
 62426	
 62427	
 62428	
 62429	CHAPTER X
 62430	
 62431	NatÃ¡sha had married in the early spring of 1813, and in 1820 already had
 62432	three daughters besides a son for whom she had longed and whom she was
 62433	now nursing. She had grown stouter and broader, so that it was difficult
 62434	to recognize in this robust, motherly woman the slim, lively NatÃ¡sha of
 62435	former days. Her features were more defined and had a calm, soft,
 62436	and serene expression. In her face there was none of the ever-glowing
 62437	animation that had formerly burned there and constituted its charm.
 62438	Now her face and body were often all that one saw, and her soul was
 62439	not visible at all. All that struck the eye was a strong, handsome, and
 62440	fertile woman. The old fire very rarely kindled in her face now. That
 62441	happened only when, as was the case that day, her husband returned home,
 62442	or a sick child was convalescent, or when she and Countess Mary spoke of
 62443	Prince Andrew (she never mentioned him to her husband, who she imagined
 62444	was jealous of Prince Andrewâs memory), or on the rare occasions when
 62445	something happened to induce her to sing, a practice she had quite
 62446	abandoned since her marriage. At the rare moments when the old fire
 62447	did kindle in her handsome, fully developed body she was even more
 62448	attractive than in former days.
 62449	
 62450	Since their marriage NatÃ¡sha and her husband had lived in Moscow, in
 62451	Petersburg, on their estate near Moscow, or with her mother, that is to
 62452	say, in Nicholasâ house. The young Countess BezÃºkhova was not often seen
 62453	in society, and those who met her there were not pleased with her
 62454	and found her neither attractive nor amiable. Not that NatÃ¡sha liked
 62455	solitudeâshe did not know whether she liked it or not, she even thought
 62456	that she did notâbut with her pregnancies, her confinements, the nursing
 62457	of her children, and sharing every moment of her husbandâs life, she had
 62458	demands on her time which could be satisfied only by renouncing society.
 62459	All who had known NatÃ¡sha before her marriage wondered at the change
 62460	in her as at something extraordinary. Only the old countess with her
 62461	maternal instinct had realized that all NatÃ¡shaâs outbursts had been due
 62462	to her need of children and a husbandâas she herself had once exclaimed
 62463	at OtrÃ¡dnoe not so much in fun as in earnestâand her mother was now
 62464	surprised at the surprise expressed by those who had never understood
 62465	NatÃ¡sha, and she kept saying that she had always known that NatÃ¡sha
 62466	would make an exemplary wife and mother.
 62467	
 62468	âOnly she lets her love of her husband and children overflow all
 62469	bounds,â said the countess, âso that it even becomes absurd.â
 62470	
 62471	NatÃ¡sha did not follow the golden rule advocated by clever folk,
 62472	especially by the French, which says that a girl should not let herself
 62473	go when she marries, should not neglect her accomplishments, should be
 62474	even more careful of her appearance than when she was unmarried, and
 62475	should fascinate her husband as much as she did before he became her
 62476	husband. NatÃ¡sha on the contrary had at once abandoned all her witchery,
 62477	of which her singing had been an unusually powerful part. She gave it up
 62478	just because it was so powerfully seductive. She took no pains with
 62479	her manners or with delicacy of speech, or with her toilet, or to show
 62480	herself to her husband in her most becoming attitudes, or to avoid
 62481	inconveniencing him by being too exacting. She acted in contradiction
 62482	to all those rules. She felt that the allurements instinct had formerly
 62483	taught her to use would now be merely ridiculous in the eyes of
 62484	her husband, to whom she had from the first moment given herself up
 62485	entirelyâthat is, with her whole soul, leaving no corner of it hidden
 62486	from him. She felt that her unity with her husband was not maintained
 62487	by the poetic feelings that had attracted him to her, but by something
 62488	elseâindefinite but firm as the bond between her own body and soul.
 62489	
 62490	To fluff out her curls, put on fashionable dresses, and sing romantic
 62491	songs to fascinate her husband would have seemed as strange as to adorn
 62492	herself to attract herself. To adorn herself for others might perhaps
 62493	have been agreeableâshe did not knowâbut she had no time at all for it.
 62494	The chief reason for devoting no time either to singing, to dress, or
 62495	to choosing her words was that she really had no time to spare for these
 62496	things.
 62497	
 62498	We know that man has the faculty of becoming completely absorbed in
 62499	a subject however trivial it may be, and that there is no subject so
 62500	trivial that it will not grow to infinite proportions if oneâs entire
 62501	attention is devoted to it.
 62502	
 62503	The subject which wholly engrossed NatÃ¡shaâs attention was her family:
 62504	that is, her husband whom she had to keep so that he should belong
 62505	entirely to her and to the home, and the children whom she had to bear,
 62506	bring into the world, nurse, and bring up.
 62507	
 62508	And the deeper she penetrated, not with her mind only but with her whole
 62509	soul, her whole being, into the subject that absorbed her, the larger
 62510	did that subject grow and the weaker and more inadequate did her powers
 62511	appear, so that she concentrated them wholly on that one thing and yet
 62512	was unable to accomplish all that she considered necessary.
 62513	
 62514	There were then as now conversations and discussions about womenâs
 62515	rights, the relations of husband and wife and their freedom and rights,
 62516	though these themes were not yet termed questions as they are now; but
 62517	these topics were not merely uninteresting to NatÃ¡sha, she positively
 62518	did not understand them.
 62519	
 62520	These questions, then as now, existed only for those who see nothing in
 62521	marriage but the pleasure married people get from one another, that is,
 62522	only the beginnings of marriage and not its whole significance, which
 62523	lies in the family.
 62524	
 62525	Discussions and questions of that kind, which are like the question of
 62526	how to get the greatest gratification from oneâs dinner, did not then
 62527	and do not now exist for those for whom the purpose of a dinner is the
 62528	nourishment it affords; and the purpose of marriage is the family.
 62529	
 62530	If the purpose of dinner is to nourish the body, a man who eats two
 62531	dinners at once may perhaps get more enjoyment but will not attain his
 62532	purpose, for his stomach will not digest the two dinners.
 62533	
 62534	If the purpose of marriage is the family, the person who wishes to have
 62535	many wives or husbands may perhaps obtain much pleasure, but in that
 62536	case will not have a family.
 62537	
 62538	If the purpose of food is nourishment and the purpose of marriage is the
 62539	family, the whole question resolves itself into not eating more than one
 62540	can digest, and not having more wives or husbands than are needed for
 62541	the familyâthat is, one wife or one husband. NatÃ¡sha needed a husband. A
 62542	husband was given her and he gave her a family. And she not only saw no
 62543	need of any other or better husband, but as all the powers of her soul
 62544	were intent on serving that husband and family, she could not imagine
 62545	and saw no interest in imagining how it would be if things were
 62546	different.
 62547	
 62548	NatÃ¡sha did not care for society in general, but prized the more the
 62549	society of her relativesâCountess Mary, and her brother, her mother, and
 62550	SÃ³nya. She valued the company of those to whom she could come striding
 62551	disheveled from the nursery in her dressing gown, and with joyful face
 62552	show a yellow instead of a green stain on babyâs napkin, and from whom
 62553	she could hear reassuring words to the effect that baby was much better.
 62554	
 62555	To such an extent had NatÃ¡sha let herself go that the way she dressed
 62556	and did her hair, her ill-chosen words, and her jealousyâshe was jealous
 62557	of SÃ³nya, of the governess, and of every woman, pretty or plainâwere
 62558	habitual subjects of jest to those about her. The general opinion was
 62559	that Pierre was under his wifeâs thumb, which was really true. From the
 62560	very first days of their married life NatÃ¡sha had announced her demands.
 62561	Pierre was greatly surprised by his wifeâs view, to him a perfectly
 62562	novel one, that every moment of his life belonged to her and to the
 62563	family. His wifeâs demands astonished him, but they also flattered him,
 62564	and he submitted to them.
 62565	
 62566	Pierreâs subjection consisted in the fact that he not only dared not
 62567	flirt with, but dared not even speak smilingly to, any other woman; did
 62568	not dare dine at the Club as a pastime, did not dare spend money on a
 62569	whim, and did not dare absent himself for any length of time, except on
 62570	businessâin which his wife included his intellectual pursuits, which
 62571	she did not in the least understand but to which she attributed great
 62572	importance. To make up for this, at home Pierre had the right to
 62573	regulate his life and that of the whole family exactly as he chose. At
 62574	home NatÃ¡sha placed herself in the position of a slave to her husband,
 62575	and the whole household went on tiptoe when he was occupiedâthat is, was
 62576	reading or writing in his study. Pierre had but to show a partiality for
 62577	anything to get just what he liked done always. He had only to express a
 62578	wish and NatÃ¡sha would jump up and run to fulfill it.
 62579	
 62580	The entire household was governed according to Pierreâs supposed orders,
 62581	that is, by his wishes which NatÃ¡sha tried to guess. Their way of
 62582	life and place of residence, their acquaintances and ties, NatÃ¡shaâs
 62583	occupations, the childrenâs upbringing, were all selected not merely
 62584	with regard to Pierreâs expressed wishes, but to what NatÃ¡sha from the
 62585	thoughts he expressed in conversation supposed his wishes to be. And she
 62586	deduced the essentials of his wishes quite correctly, and having once
 62587	arrived at them clung to them tenaciously. When Pierre himself wanted to
 62588	change his mind she would fight him with his own weapons.
 62589	
 62590	Thus in a time of trouble ever memorable to him after the birth of their
 62591	first child who was delicate, when they had to change the wet nurse
 62592	three times and NatÃ¡sha fell ill from despair, Pierre one day told her
 62593	of Rousseauâs view, with which he quite agreed, that to have a wet
 62594	nurse is unnatural and harmful. When her next baby was born, despite
 62595	the opposition of her mother, the doctors, and even of her husband
 62596	himselfâwho were all vigorously opposed to her nursing her baby herself,
 62597	a thing then unheard of and considered injuriousâshe insisted on having
 62598	her own way, and after that nursed all her babies herself.
 62599	
 62600	It very often happened that in a moment of irritation husband and wife
 62601	would have a dispute, but long afterwards Pierre to his surprise and
 62602	delight would find in his wifeâs ideas and actions the very thought
 62603	against which she had argued, but divested of everything superfluous
 62604	that in the excitement of the dispute he had added when expressing his
 62605	opinion.
 62606	
 62607	After seven years of marriage Pierre had the joyous and firm
 62608	consciousness that he was not a bad man, and he felt this because he saw
 62609	himself reflected in his wife. He felt the good and bad within himself
 62610	inextricably mingled and overlapping. But only what was really good in
 62611	him was reflected in his wife, all that was not quite good was rejected.
 62612	And this was not the result of logical reasoning but was a direct and
 62613	mysterious reflection.
 62614	
 62615	
 62616	
 62617	
 62618	
 62619	CHAPTER XI
 62620	
 62621	Two months previously when Pierre was already staying with the RostÃ³vs
 62622	he had received a letter from Prince Theodore, asking him to come
 62623	to Petersburg to confer on some important questions that were being
 62624	discussed there by a society of which Pierre was one of the principal
 62625	founders.
 62626	
 62627	On reading that letter (she always read her husbandâs letters) NatÃ¡sha
 62628	herself suggested that he should go to Petersburg, though she would feel
 62629	his absence very acutely. She attributed immense importance to all
 62630	her husbandâs intellectual and abstract interests though she did not
 62631	understand them, and she always dreaded being a hindrance to him in such
 62632	matters. To Pierreâs timid look of inquiry after reading the letter she
 62633	replied by asking him to go, but to fix a definite date for his return.
 62634	He was given four weeksâ leave of absence.
 62635	
 62636	Ever since that leave of absence had expired, more than a fortnight
 62637	before, NatÃ¡sha had been in a constant state of alarm, depression, and
 62638	irritability.
 62639	
 62640	DenÃ­sov, now a general on the retired list and much dissatisfied with
 62641	the present state of affairs, had arrived during that fortnight. He
 62642	looked at NatÃ¡sha with sorrow and surprise as at a bad likeness of a
 62643	person once dear. A dull, dejected look, random replies, and talk about
 62644	the nursery was all he saw and heard from his former enchantress.
 62645	
 62646	NatÃ¡sha was sad and irritable all that time, especially when her mother,
 62647	her brother, SÃ³nya, or Countess Mary in their efforts to console her
 62648	tried to excuse Pierre and suggested reasons for his delay in returning.
 62649	
 62650	âItâs all nonsense, all rubbishâthose discussions which lead to nothing
 62651	and all those idiotic societies!â NatÃ¡sha declared of the very affairs
 62652	in the immense importance of which she firmly believed.
 62653	
 62654	And she would go to the nursery to nurse PÃ©tya, her only boy. No one
 62655	else could tell her anything so comforting or so reasonable as this
 62656	little three-month-old creature when he lay at her breast and she was
 62657	conscious of the movement of his lips and the snuffling of his little
 62658	nose. That creature said: âYou are angry, you are jealous, you would
 62659	like to pay him out, you are afraidâbut here am I! And I am he...â and
 62660	that was unanswerable. It was more than true.
 62661	
 62662	During that fortnight of anxiety NatÃ¡sha resorted to the baby for
 62663	comfort so often, and fussed over him so much, that she overfed him and
 62664	he fell ill. She was terrified by his illness, and yet that was just
 62665	what she needed. While attending to him she bore the anxiety about her
 62666	husband more easily.
 62667	
 62668	She was nursing her boy when the sound of Pierreâs sleigh was heard
 62669	at the front door, and the old nurseâknowing how to please her
 62670	mistressâentered the room inaudibly but hurriedly and with a beaming
 62671	face.
 62672	
 62673	âHas he come?â NatÃ¡sha asked quickly in a whisper, afraid to move lest
 62674	she should rouse the dozing baby.
 62675	
 62676	âHeâs come, maâam,â whispered the nurse.
 62677	
 62678	The blood rushed to NatÃ¡shaâs face and her feet involuntarily moved, but
 62679	she could not jump up and run out. The baby again opened his eyes and
 62680	looked at her. âYouâre here?â he seemed to be saying, and again lazily
 62681	smacked his lips.
 62682	
 62683	Cautiously withdrawing her breast, NatÃ¡sha rocked him a little, handed
 62684	him to the nurse, and went with rapid steps toward the door. But at the
 62685	door she stopped as if her conscience reproached her for having in
 62686	her joy left the child too soon, and she glanced round. The nurse with
 62687	raised elbows was lifting the infant over the rail of his cot.
 62688	
 62689	âGo, maâam! Donât worry, go!â she whispered, smiling, with the kind of
 62690	familiarity that grows up between a nurse and her mistress.
 62691	
 62692	NatÃ¡sha ran with light footsteps to the anteroom.
 62693	
 62694	DenÃ­sov, who had come out of the study into the dancing room with his
 62695	pipe, now for the first time recognized the old NatÃ¡sha. A flood of
 62696	brilliant, joyful light poured from her transfigured face.
 62697	
 62698	âHeâs come!â she exclaimed as she ran past, and DenÃ­sov felt that he too
 62699	was delighted that Pierre, whom he did not much care for, had returned.
 62700	
 62701	On reaching the vestibule NatÃ¡sha saw a tall figure in a fur coat
 62702	unwinding his scarf. âItâs he! Itâs really he! He has come!â she said
 62703	to herself, and rushing at him embraced him, pressed his head to her
 62704	breast, and then pushed him back and gazed at his ruddy, happy face,
 62705	covered with hoarfrost. âYes, it is he, happy and contented....â
 62706	
 62707	Then all at once she remembered the tortures of suspense she had
 62708	experienced for the last fortnight, and the joy that had lit up her
 62709	face vanished; she frowned and overwhelmed Pierre with a torrent of
 62710	reproaches and angry words.
 62711	
 62712	âYes, itâs all very well for you. You are pleased, youâve had a good
 62713	time.... But what about me? You might at least have shown consideration
 62714	for the children. I am nursing and my milk was spoiled.... PÃ©tya was at
 62715	deathâs door. But you were enjoying yourself. Yes, enjoying...â
 62716	
 62717	Pierre knew he was not to blame, for he could not have come sooner; he
 62718	knew this outburst was unseemly and would blow over in a minute or two;
 62719	above all he knew that he himself was bright and happy. He wanted
 62720	to smile but dared not even think of doing so. He made a piteous,
 62721	frightened face and bent down.
 62722	
 62723	âI could not, on my honor. But how is PÃ©tya?â
 62724	
 62725	âAll right now. Come along! I wonder youâre not ashamed! If only you
 62726	could see what I was like without you, how I suffered!â
 62727	
 62728	âYou are well?â
 62729	
 62730	âCome, come!â she said, not letting go of his arm. And they went to
 62731	their rooms.
 62732	
 62733	When Nicholas and his wife came to look for Pierre he was in the nursery
 62734	holding his baby son, who was again awake, on his huge right palm and
 62735	dandling him. A blissful bright smile was fixed on the babyâs broad face
 62736	with its toothless open mouth. The storm was long since over and there
 62737	was bright, joyous sunshine on NatÃ¡shaâs face as she gazed tenderly at
 62738	her husband and child.
 62739	
 62740	âAnd have you talked everything well over with Prince Theodore?â she
 62741	asked.
 62742	
 62743	âYes, capitally.â
 62744	
 62745	âYou see, he holds it up.â (She meant the babyâs head.) âBut how he did
 62746	frighten me... Youâve seen the princess? Is it true sheâs in love with
 62747	that...â
 62748	
 62749	âYes, just fancy...â
 62750	
 62751	At that moment Nicholas and Countess Mary came in. Pierre with the baby
 62752	on his hand stooped, kissed them, and replied to their inquiries. But
 62753	in spite of much that was interesting and had to be discussed, the baby
 62754	with the little cap on its unsteady head evidently absorbed all his
 62755	attention.
 62756	
 62757	âHow sweet!â said Countess Mary, looking at and playing with the baby.
 62758	âNow, Nicholas,â she added, turning to her husband, âI canât understand
 62759	how it is you donât see the charm of these delicious marvels.â
 62760	
 62761	âI donât and canât,â replied Nicholas, looking coldly at the baby. âA
 62762	lump of flesh. Come along, Pierre!â
 62763	
 62764	âAnd yet heâs such an affectionate father,â said Countess Mary,
 62765	vindicating her husband, âbut only after they are a year old or so...â
 62766	
 62767	âNow, Pierre nurses them splendidly,â said NatÃ¡sha. âHe says his hand is
 62768	just made for a babyâs seat. Just look!â
 62769	
 62770	âOnly not for this...â Pierre suddenly exclaimed with a laugh, and
 62771	shifting the baby he gave him to the nurse.
 62772	
 62773	
 62774	
 62775	
 62776	
 62777	CHAPTER XII
 62778	
 62779	As in every large household, there were at Bald Hills several perfectly
 62780	distinct worlds which merged into one harmonious whole, though each
 62781	retained its own peculiarities and made concessions to the others. Every
 62782	event, joyful or sad, that took place in that house was important to all
 62783	these worlds, but each had its own special reasons to rejoice or grieve
 62784	over that occurrence independently of the others.
 62785	
 62786	For instance, Pierreâs return was a joyful and important event and they
 62787	all felt it to be so.
 62788	
 62789	The servantsâthe most reliable judges of their masters because they
 62790	judge not by their conversation or expressions of feeling but by their
 62791	acts and way of lifeâwere glad of Pierreâs return because they knew that
 62792	when he was there Count Nicholas would cease going every day to attend
 62793	to the estate, and would be in better spirits and temper, and also
 62794	because they would all receive handsome presents for the holidays.
 62795	
 62796	The children and their governesses were glad of Pierreâs return because
 62797	no one else drew them into the social life of the household as he did.
 62798	He alone could play on the clavichord that Ã©cossaise (his only piece)
 62799	to which, as he said, all possible dances could be danced, and they felt
 62800	sure he had brought presents for them all.
 62801	
 62802	Young Nicholas, now a slim lad of fifteen, delicate and intelligent,
 62803	with curly light-brown hair and beautiful eyes, was delighted because
 62804	Uncle Pierre as he called him was the object of his rapturous and
 62805	passionate affection. No one had instilled into him this love for Pierre
 62806	whom he saw only occasionally. Countess Mary who had brought him up
 62807	had done her utmost to make him love her husband as she loved him, and
 62808	little Nicholas did love his uncle, but loved him with just a shade of
 62809	contempt. Pierre, however, he adored. He did not want to be an hussar or
 62810	a Knight of St. George like his uncle Nicholas; he wanted to be learned,
 62811	wise, and kind like Pierre. In Pierreâs presence his face always shone
 62812	with pleasure and he flushed and was breathless when Pierre spoke to
 62813	him. He did not miss a single word he uttered, and would afterwards,
 62814	with Dessalles or by himself, recall and reconsider the meaning of
 62815	everything Pierre had said. Pierreâs past life and his unhappiness prior
 62816	to 1812 (of which young Nicholas had formed a vague poetic picture from
 62817	some words he had overheard), his adventures in Moscow, his captivity,
 62818	PlatÃ³n KaratÃ¡ev (of whom he had heard from Pierre), his love for NatÃ¡sha
 62819	(of whom the lad was also particularly fond), and especially Pierreâs
 62820	friendship with the father whom Nicholas could not rememberâall this
 62821	made Pierre in his eyes a hero and a saint.
 62822	
 62823	From broken remarks about NatÃ¡sha and his father, from the emotion with
 62824	which Pierre spoke of that dead father, and from the careful, reverent
 62825	tenderness with which NatÃ¡sha spoke of him, the boy, who was only just
 62826	beginning to guess what love is, derived the notion that his father had
 62827	loved NatÃ¡sha and when dying had left her to his friend. But the father
 62828	whom the boy did not remember appeared to him a divinity who could not
 62829	be pictured, and of whom he never thought without a swelling heart and
 62830	tears of sadness and rapture. So the boy also was happy that Pierre had
 62831	arrived.
 62832	
 62833	The guests welcomed Pierre because he always helped to enliven and unite
 62834	any company he was in.
 62835	
 62836	The grown-up members of the family, not to mention his wife, were
 62837	pleased to have back a friend whose presence made life run more smoothly
 62838	and peacefully.
 62839	
 62840	The old ladies were pleased with the presents he brought them, and
 62841	especially that NatÃ¡sha would now be herself again.
 62842	
 62843	Pierre felt the different outlooks of these various worlds and made
 62844	haste to satisfy all their expectations.
 62845	
 62846	Though the most absent-minded and forgetful of men, Pierre, with the aid
 62847	of a list his wife drew up, had now bought everything, not forgetting
 62848	his motherâand brother-in-lawâs commissions, nor the dress material for
 62849	a present to BelÃ³va, nor toys for his wifeâs nephews. In the early days
 62850	of his marriage it had seemed strange to him that his wife should expect
 62851	him not to forget to procure all the things he undertook to buy, and he
 62852	had been taken aback by her serious annoyance when on his first trip he
 62853	forgot everything. But in time he grew used to this demand. Knowing that
 62854	NatÃ¡sha asked nothing for herself, and gave him commissions for others
 62855	only when he himself had offered to undertake them, he now found an
 62856	unexpected and childlike pleasure in this purchase of presents for
 62857	everyone in the house, and never forgot anything. If he now incurred
 62858	NatÃ¡shaâs censure it was only for buying too many and too expensive
 62859	things. To her other defects (as most people thought them, but which
 62860	to Pierre were qualities) of untidiness and neglect of herself, she now
 62861	added stinginess.
 62862	
 62863	From the time that Pierre began life as a family man on a footing
 62864	entailing heavy expenditure, he had noticed to his surprise that he
 62865	spent only half as much as before, and that his affairsâwhich had been
 62866	in disorder of late, chiefly because of his first wifeâs debtsâhad begun
 62867	to improve.
 62868	
 62869	Life was cheaper because it was circumscribed: that most expensive
 62870	luxury, the kind of life that can be changed at any moment, was no
 62871	longer his nor did he wish for it. He felt that his way of life had now
 62872	been settled once for all till death and that to change it was not in
 62873	his power, and so that way of life proved economical.
 62874	
 62875	With a merry, smiling face Pierre was sorting his purchases.
 62876	
 62877	âWhat do you think of this?â said he, unrolling a piece of stuff like a
 62878	shopman.
 62879	
 62880	NatÃ¡sha, who was sitting opposite to him with her eldest daughter on her
 62881	lap, turned her sparkling eyes swiftly from her husband to the things he
 62882	showed her.
 62883	
 62884	âThatâs for BelÃ³va? Excellent!â She felt the quality of the material.
 62885	âIt was a ruble an arshin, I suppose?â
 62886	
 62887	Pierre told her the price.
 62888	
 62889	âToo dear!â NatÃ¡sha remarked. âHow pleased the children will be and
 62890	Mamma too! Only you need not have bought me this,â she added, unable to
 62891	suppress a smile as she gazed admiringly at a gold comb set with pearls,
 62892	of a kind then just coming into fashion.
 62893	
 62894	âAdÃ¨le tempted me: she kept on telling me to buy it,â returned Pierre.
 62895	
 62896	âWhen am I to wear it?â and NatÃ¡sha stuck it in her coil of hair. âWhen
 62897	I take little MÃ¡sha into society? Perhaps they will be fashionable again
 62898	by then. Well, letâs go now.â
 62899	
 62900	And collecting the presents they went first to the nursery and then to
 62901	the old countessâ rooms.
 62902	
 62903	The countess was sitting with her companion BelÃ³va, playing
 62904	grand-patience as usual, when Pierre and NatÃ¡sha came into the drawing
 62905	room with parcels under their arms.
 62906	
 62907	The countess was now over sixty, was quite gray, and wore a cap with a
 62908	frill that surrounded her face. Her face had shriveled, her upper lip
 62909	had sunk in, and her eyes were dim.
 62910	
 62911	After the deaths of her son and husband in such rapid succession, she
 62912	felt herself a being accidentally forgotten in this world and left
 62913	without aim or object for her existence. She ate, drank, slept, or kept
 62914	awake, but did not live. Life gave her no new impressions. She wanted
 62915	nothing from life but tranquillity, and that tranquillity only death
 62916	could give her. But until death came she had to go on living, that is,
 62917	to use her vital forces. A peculiarity one sees in very young children
 62918	and very old people was particularly evident in her. Her life had
 62919	no external aimsâonly a need to exercise her various functions and
 62920	inclinations was apparent. She had to eat, sleep, think, speak, weep,
 62921	work, give vent to her anger, and so on, merely because she had a
 62922	stomach, a brain, muscles, nerves, and a liver. She did these things not
 62923	under any external impulse as people in the full vigor of life do,
 62924	when behind the purpose for which they strive that of exercising their
 62925	functions remains unnoticed. She talked only because she physically
 62926	needed to exercise her tongue and lungs. She cried as a child does,
 62927	because her nose had to be cleared, and so on. What for people in their
 62928	full vigor is an aim was for her evidently merely a pretext.
 62929	
 62930	Thus in the morningâespecially if she had eaten anything rich the day
 62931	beforeâshe felt a need of being angry and would choose as the handiest
 62932	pretext BelÃ³vaâs deafness.
 62933	
 62934	She would begin to say something to her in a low tone from the other end
 62935	of the room.
 62936	
 62937	âIt seems a little warmer today, my dear,â she would murmur.
 62938	
 62939	And when BelÃ³va replied: âOh yes, theyâve come,â she would mutter
 62940	angrily: âO Lord! How stupid and deaf she is!â
 62941	
 62942	Another pretext would be her snuff, which would seem too dry or too damp
 62943	or not rubbed fine enough. After these fits of irritability her face
 62944	would grow yellow, and her maids knew by infallible symptoms when BelÃ³va
 62945	would again be deaf, the snuff damp, and the countessâ face yellow. Just
 62946	as she needed to work off her spleen so she had sometimes to exercise
 62947	her still-existing faculty of thinkingâand the pretext for that was a
 62948	game of patience. When she needed to cry, the deceased count would be
 62949	the pretext. When she wanted to be agitated, Nicholas and his health
 62950	would be the pretext, and when she felt a need to speak spitefully, the
 62951	pretext would be Countess Mary. When her vocal organs needed exercise,
 62952	which was usually toward seven oâclock when she had had an after-dinner
 62953	rest in a darkened room, the pretext would be the retelling of the same
 62954	stories over and over again to the same audience.
 62955	
 62956	The old ladyâs condition was understood by the whole household though no
 62957	one ever spoke of it, and they all made every possible effort to satisfy
 62958	her needs. Only by a rare glance exchanged with a sad smile
 62959	between Nicholas, Pierre, NatÃ¡sha, and Countess Mary was the common
 62960	understanding of her condition expressed.
 62961	
 62962	But those glances expressed something more: they said that she had
 62963	played her part in life, that what they now saw was not her whole self,
 62964	that we must all become like her, and that they were glad to yield to
 62965	her, to restrain themselves for this once precious being formerly as
 62966	full of life as themselves, but now so much to be pitied. âMemento
 62967	mori,â said these glances.
 62968	
 62969	Only the really heartless, the stupid ones of that household, and the
 62970	little children failed to understand this and avoided her.
 62971	
 62972	
 62973	
 62974	
 62975	
 62976	CHAPTER XIII
 62977	
 62978	When Pierre and his wife entered the drawing room the countess was in
 62979	one of her customary states in which she needed the mental exertion of
 62980	playing patience, and soâthough by force of habit she greeted him with
 62981	the words she always used when Pierre or her son returned after an
 62982	absence: âHigh time, my dear, high time! We were all weary of waiting
 62983	for you. Well, thank God!â and received her presents with another
 62984	customary remark: âItâs not the gift thatâs precious, my dear, but that
 62985	you give it to me, an old woman...ââyet it was evident that she was
 62986	not pleased by Pierreâs arrival at that moment when it diverted her
 62987	attention from the unfinished game.
 62988	
 62989	She finished her game of patience and only then examined the presents.
 62990	They consisted of a box for cards, of splendid workmanship, a
 62991	bright-blue SÃ¨vres tea cup with shepherdesses depicted on it and with
 62992	a lid, and a gold snuffbox with the countâs portrait on the lid which
 62993	Pierre had had done by a miniaturist in Petersburg. The countess had
 62994	long wished for such a box, but as she did not want to cry just then she
 62995	glanced indifferently at the portrait and gave her attention chiefly to
 62996	the box for cards.
 62997	
 62998	âThank you, my dear, you have cheered me up,â said she as she always
 62999	did. âBut best of all you have brought yourself backâfor I never saw
 63000	anything like it, you ought to give your wife a scolding! What are we
 63001	to do with her? She is like a mad woman when you are away. Doesnât see
 63002	anything, doesnât remember anything,â she went on, repeating her usual
 63003	phrases. âLook, Anna TimofÃ©evna,â she added to her companion, âsee what
 63004	a box for cards my son has brought us!â
 63005	
 63006	BelÃ³va admired the presents and was delighted with her dress material.
 63007	
 63008	Though Pierre, NatÃ¡sha, Nicholas, Countess Mary, and DenÃ­sov had much to
 63009	talk about that they could not discuss before the old countessânot
 63010	that anything was hidden from her, but because she had dropped so
 63011	far behindhand in many things that had they begun to converse in her
 63012	presence they would have had to answer inopportune questions and to
 63013	repeat what they had already told her many times: that so-and-so was
 63014	dead and so-and-so was married, which she would again be unable to
 63015	rememberâyet they sat at tea round the samovar in the drawing room from
 63016	habit, and Pierre answered the countessâ questions as to whether Prince
 63017	VasÃ­li had aged and whether Countess Mary AlexÃ©evna had sent greetings
 63018	and still thought of them, and other matters that interested no one and
 63019	to which she herself was indifferent.
 63020	
 63021	Conversation of this kind, interesting to no one yet unavoidable,
 63022	continued all through teatime. All the grown-up members of the family
 63023	were assembled near the round tea table at which SÃ³nya presided beside
 63024	the samovar. The children with their tutors and governesses had had
 63025	tea and their voices were audible from the next room. At tea all sat
 63026	in their accustomed places: Nicholas beside the stove at a small table
 63027	where his tea was handed to him; MÃ­lka, the old gray borzoi bitch
 63028	(daughter of the first MÃ­lka), with a quite gray face and large black
 63029	eyes that seemed more prominent than ever, lay on the armchair beside
 63030	him; DenÃ­sov, whose curly hair, mustache, and whiskers had turned half
 63031	gray, sat beside countess Mary with his generalâs tunic unbuttoned;
 63032	Pierre sat between his wife and the old countess. He spoke of what he
 63033	knew might interest the old lady and that she could understand. He
 63034	told her of external social events and of the people who had formed
 63035	the circle of her contemporaries and had once been a real, living, and
 63036	distinct group, but who were now for the most part scattered about the
 63037	world and like herself were garnering the last ears of the harvests they
 63038	had sown in earlier years. But to the old countess those contemporaries
 63039	of hers seemed to be the only serious and real society. NatÃ¡sha saw by
 63040	Pierreâs animation that his visit had been interesting and that he had
 63041	much to tell them but dare not say it before the old countess. DenÃ­sov,
 63042	not being a member of the family, did not understand Pierreâs caution
 63043	and being, as a malcontent, much interested in what was occurring in
 63044	Petersburg, kept urging Pierre to tell them about what had happened in
 63045	the SemÃ«novsk regiment, then about ArakchÃ©ev, and then about the Bible
 63046	Society. Once or twice Pierre was carried away and began to speak of
 63047	these things, but Nicholas and NatÃ¡sha always brought him back to the
 63048	health of Prince IvÃ¡n and Countess Mary AlexÃ©evna.
 63049	
 63050	âWell, and all this idiocyâGossner and TatÃ¡winova?â DenÃ­sov asked. âIs
 63051	that weally still going on?â
 63052	
 63053	âGoing on?â Pierre exclaimed. âWhy more than ever! The Bible Society is
 63054	the whole government now!â
 63055	
 63056	âWhat is that, mon cher ami?â asked the countess, who had finished her
 63057	tea and evidently needed a pretext for being angry after her meal. âWhat
 63058	are you saying about the government? I donât understand.â
 63059	
 63060	âWell, you know, Maman,â Nicholas interposed, knowing how to translate
 63061	things into his motherâs language, âPrince Alexander GolÃ­tsyn has
 63062	founded a society and in consequence has great influence, they say.â
 63063	
 63064	âArakchÃ©ev and GolÃ­tsyn,â incautiously remarked Pierre, âare now the
 63065	whole government! And what a government! They see treason everywhere and
 63066	are afraid of everything.â
 63067	
 63068	âWell, and how is Prince Alexander to blame? He is a most estimable
 63069	man. I used to meet him at Mary AntÃ³novnaâs,â said the countess in an
 63070	offended tone; and still more offended that they all remained silent,
 63071	she went on: âNowadays everyone finds fault. A Gospel Society! Well, and
 63072	what harm is there in that?â and she rose (everybody else got up too)
 63073	and with a severe expression sailed back to her table in the sitting
 63074	room.
 63075	
 63076	The melancholy silence that followed was broken by the sounds of the
 63077	childrenâs voices and laughter from the next room. Evidently some jolly
 63078	excitement was going on there.
 63079	
 63080	âFinished, finished!â little NatÃ¡shaâs gleeful yell rose above them all.
 63081	
 63082	Pierre exchanged glances with Countess Mary and Nicholas (NatÃ¡sha he
 63083	never lost sight of) and smiled happily.
 63084	
 63085	âThatâs delightful music!â said he.
 63086	
 63087	âIt means that Anna MakÃ¡rovna has finished her stocking,â said Countess
 63088	Mary.
 63089	
 63090	âOh, Iâll go and see,â said Pierre, jumping up. âYou know,â he added,
 63091	stopping at the door, âwhy Iâm especially fond of that music? It is
 63092	always the first thing that tells me all is well. When I was driving
 63093	here today, the nearer I got to the house the more anxious I grew. As I
 63094	entered the anteroom I heard AndrÃºshaâs peals of laughter and that meant
 63095	that all was well.â
 63096	
 63097	âI know! I know that feeling,â said Nicholas. âBut I mustnât go
 63098	thereâthose stockings are to be a surprise for me.â
 63099	
 63100	Pierre went to the children, and the shouting and laughter grew still
 63101	louder.
 63102	
 63103	âCome, Anna MakÃ¡rovna,â Pierreâs voice was heard saying, âcome here into
 63104	the middle of the room and at the word of command, âOne, two,â and
 63105	when I say âthreeâ... You stand here, and you in my armsâwell now! One,
 63106	two!...â said Pierre, and a silence followed: âthree!â and a rapturously
 63107	breathless cry of childrenâs voices filled the room. âTwo, two!â they
 63108	shouted.
 63109	
 63110	This meant two stockings, which by a secret process known only to
 63111	herself Anna MakÃ¡rovna used to knit at the same time on the same
 63112	needles, and which, when they were ready, she always triumphantly drew,
 63113	one out of the other, in the childrenâs presence.
 63114	
 63115	
 63116	
 63117	
 63118	
 63119	CHAPTER XIV
 63120	
 63121	Soon after this the children came in to say good night. They kissed
 63122	everyone, the tutors and governesses made their bows, and they went out.
 63123	Only young Nicholas and his tutor remained. Dessalles whispered to the
 63124	boy to come downstairs.
 63125	
 63126	âNo, Monsieur Dessalles, I will ask my aunt to let me stay,â replied
 63127	Nicholas BolkÃ³nski also in a whisper.
 63128	
 63129	âMa tante, please let me stay,â said he, going up to his aunt.
 63130	
 63131	His face expressed entreaty, agitation, and ecstasy. Countess Mary
 63132	glanced at him and turned to Pierre.
 63133	
 63134	âWhen you are here he canât tear himself away,â she said.
 63135	
 63136	âI will bring him to you directly, Monsieur Dessalles. Good night!â
 63137	said Pierre, giving his hand to the Swiss tutor, and he turned to young
 63138	Nicholas with a smile. âYou and I havenât seen anything of one another
 63139	yet.... How like he is growing, Mary!â he added, addressing Countess
 63140	Mary.
 63141	
 63142	âLike my father?â asked the boy, flushing crimson and looking up at
 63143	Pierre with bright, ecstatic eyes.
 63144	
 63145	Pierre nodded, and went on with what he had been saying when the
 63146	children had interrupted. Countess Mary sat down doing woolwork; NatÃ¡sha
 63147	did not take her eyes off her husband. Nicholas and DenÃ­sov rose, asked
 63148	for their pipes, smoked, went to fetch more tea from SÃ³nyaâwho sat weary
 63149	but resolute at the samovarâand questioned Pierre. The curly-headed,
 63150	delicate boy sat with shining eyes unnoticed in a corner, starting
 63151	every now and then and muttering something to himself, and evidently
 63152	experiencing a new and powerful emotion as he turned his curly head,
 63153	with his thin neck exposed by his turn-down collar, toward the place
 63154	where Pierre sat.
 63155	
 63156	The conversation turned on the contemporary gossip about those in power,
 63157	in which most people see the chief interest of home politics. DenÃ­sov,
 63158	dissatisfied with the government on account of his own disappointments
 63159	in the service, heard with pleasure of the things done in Petersburg
 63160	which seemed to him stupid, and made forcible and sharp comments on what
 63161	Pierre told them.
 63162	
 63163	âOne used to have to be a Germanânow one must dance with TatÃ¡winova
 63164	and Madame KwÃ¼dener, and wead Eckaâtshausen and the bwethwen. Oh, they
 63165	should let that fine fellow Bonaparte looseâheâd knock all this nonsense
 63166	out of them! Fancy giving the command of the SemÃ«nov wegiment to a
 63167	fellow like that Schwaâtz!â he cried.
 63168	
 63169	Nicholas, though free from DenÃ­sovâs readiness to find fault with
 63170	everything, also thought that discussion of the government was a very
 63171	serious and weighty matter, and the fact that A had been appointed
 63172	Minister of This and B Governor General of That, and that the Emperor
 63173	had said so-and-so and this minister so-and-so, seemed to him very
 63174	important. And so he thought it necessary to take an interest in these
 63175	things and to question Pierre. The questions put by these two kept the
 63176	conversation from changing its ordinary character of gossip about the
 63177	higher government circles.
 63178	
 63179	But NatÃ¡sha, knowing all her husbandâs ways and ideas, saw that he had
 63180	long been wishing but had been unable to divert the conversation to
 63181	another channel and express his own deeply felt idea for the sake of
 63182	which he had gone to Petersburg to consult with his new friend Prince
 63183	Theodore, and she helped him by asking how his affairs with Prince
 63184	Theodore had gone.
 63185	
 63186	âWhat was it about?â asked Nicholas.
 63187	
 63188	âAlways the same thing,â said Pierre, looking round at his listeners.
 63189	âEverybody sees that things are going so badly that they cannot be
 63190	allowed to go on so and that it is the duty of all decent men to
 63191	counteract it as far as they can.â
 63192	
 63193	âWhat can decent men do?â Nicholas inquired, frowning slightly. âWhat
 63194	can be done?â
 63195	
 63196	âWhy, this...â
 63197	
 63198	âCome into my study,â said Nicholas.
 63199	
 63200	NatÃ¡sha, who had long expected to be fetched to nurse her baby, now
 63201	heard the nurse calling her and went to the nursery. Countess Mary
 63202	followed her. The men went into the study and little Nicholas BolkÃ³nski
 63203	followed them unnoticed by his uncle and sat down at the writing table
 63204	in a shady corner by the window.
 63205	
 63206	âWell, what would you do?â asked DenÃ­sov.
 63207	
 63208	âAlways some fantastic schemes,â said Nicholas.
 63209	
 63210	âWhy this,â began Pierre, not sitting down but pacing the room,
 63211	sometimes stopping short, gesticulating, and lisping: âthe position
 63212	in Petersburg is this: the Emperor does not look into anything. He
 63213	has abandoned himself altogether to this mysticismâ (Pierre could not
 63214	tolerate mysticism in anyone now). âHe seeks only for peace, and only
 63215	these people sans foi ni loi * can give it himâpeople who recklessly
 63216	hack at and strangle everythingâMagnÃ­tski, ArakchÃ©ev, and tutti
 63217	quanti.... You will agree that if you did not look after your estates
 63218	yourself but only wanted a quiet life, the harsher your steward was the
 63219	more readily your object might be attained,â he said to Nicholas.
 63220	
 63221	    * Without faith or law.
 63222	
 63223	âWell, what does that lead up to?â said Nicholas.
 63224	
 63225	âWell, everything is going to ruin! Robbery in the law courts, in the
 63226	army nothing but flogging, drilling, and Military Settlements; the
 63227	people are tortured, enlightenment is suppressed. All that is young and
 63228	honest is crushed! Everyone sees that this cannot go on. Everything is
 63229	strained to such a degree that it will certainly break,â said Pierre (as
 63230	those who examine the actions of any government have always said since
 63231	governments began). âI told them just one thing in Petersburg.â
 63232	
 63233	âTold whom?â
 63234	
 63235	âWell, you know whom,â said Pierre, with a meaning glance from under
 63236	his brows. âPrince Theodore and all those. To encourage culture and
 63237	philanthropy is all very well of course. The aim is excellent but in the
 63238	present circumstances something else is needed.â
 63239	
 63240	At that moment Nicholas noticed the presence of his nephew. His face
 63241	darkened and he went up to the boy.
 63242	
 63243	âWhy are you here?â
 63244	
 63245	âWhy? Let him be,â said Pierre, taking Nicholas by the arm and
 63246	continuing. âThat is not enough, I told them. Something else is needed.
 63247	When you stand expecting the overstrained string to snap at any moment,
 63248	when everyone is expecting the inevitable catastrophe, as many as
 63249	possible must join hands as closely as they can to withstand the general
 63250	calamity. Everything that is young and strong is being enticed away and
 63251	depraved. One is lured by women, another by honors, a third by ambition
 63252	or money, and they go over to that camp. No independent men, such as you
 63253	or I, are left. What I say is widen the scope of our society, let the
 63254	mot dâordre be not virtue alone but independence and action as well!â
 63255	
 63256	Nicholas, who had left his nephew, irritably pushed up an armchair, sat
 63257	down in it, and listened to Pierre, coughing discontentedly and frowning
 63258	more and more.
 63259	
 63260	âBut action with what aim?â he cried. âAnd what position will you adopt
 63261	toward the government?â
 63262	
 63263	âWhy, the position of assistants. The society need not be secret if the
 63264	government allows it. Not merely is it not hostile to government, but
 63265	it is a society of true conservativesâa society of gentlemen in the full
 63266	meaning of that word. It is only to prevent some PugachÃ«v or other from
 63267	killing my children and yours, and ArakchÃ©ev from sending me off to some
 63268	Military Settlement. We join hands only for the public welfare and the
 63269	general safety.â
 63270	
 63271	âYes, but itâs a secret society and therefore a hostile and harmful one
 63272	which can only cause harm.â
 63273	
 63274	âWhy? Did the Tugendbund which saved Europeâ (they did not then venture
 63275	to suggest that Russia had saved Europe) âdo any harm? The Tugendbund
 63276	is an alliance of virtue: it is love, mutual help... it is what Christ
 63277	preached on the Cross.â
 63278	
 63279	NatÃ¡sha, who had come in during the conversation, looked joyfully at
 63280	her husband. It was not what he was saying that pleased herâthat did not
 63281	even interest her, for it seemed to her that was all extremely simple
 63282	and that she had known it a long time (it seemed so to her because she
 63283	knew that it sprang from Pierreâs whole soul), but it was his animated
 63284	and enthusiastic appearance that made her glad.
 63285	
 63286	The boy with the thin neck stretching out from the turn-down collarâwhom
 63287	everyone had forgottenâgazed at Pierre with even greater and more
 63288	rapturous joy. Every word of Pierreâs burned into his heart, and with a
 63289	nervous movement of his fingers he unconsciously broke the sealing wax
 63290	and quill pens his hands came upon on his uncleâs table.
 63291	
 63292	âIt is not at all what you suppose; but that is what the German
 63293	Tugendbund was, and what I am proposing.â
 63294	
 63295	âNo, my fwiend! The Tugendbund is all vewy well for the sausage eaters,
 63296	but I donât understand it and canât even pwonounce it,â interposed
 63297	DenÃ­sov in a loud and resolute voice. âI agwee that evewything here is
 63298	wotten and howwible, but the Tugendbund I donât understand. If weâre
 63299	not satisfied, let us have a bunt of our own. Thatâs all wight. Je suis
 63300	votâe homme!â *
 63301	
 63302	    * âIâm your man.â
 63303	
 63304	
 63305	Pierre smiled, NatÃ¡sha began to laugh, but Nicholas knitted his brows
 63306	still more and began proving to Pierre that there was no prospect of
 63307	any great change and that all the danger he spoke of existed only in his
 63308	imagination. Pierre maintained the contrary, and as his mental faculties
 63309	were greater and more resourceful, Nicholas felt himself cornered. This
 63310	made him still angrier, for he was fully convinced, not by reasoning
 63311	but by something within him stronger than reason, of the justice of his
 63312	opinion.
 63313	
 63314	âI will tell you this,â he said, rising and trying with nervously
 63315	twitching fingers to prop up his pipe in a corner, but finally
 63316	abandoning the attempt. âI canât prove it to you. You say that
 63317	everything here is rotten and that an overthrow is coming: I donât
 63318	see it. But you also say that our oath of allegiance is a conditional
 63319	matter, and to that I reply: âYou are my best friend, as you know,
 63320	but if you formed a secret society and began working against the
 63321	governmentâbe it what it mayâI know it is my duty to obey the
 63322	government. And if ArakchÃ©ev ordered me to lead a squadron against you
 63323	and cut you down, I should not hesitate an instant, but should do it.â
 63324	And you may argue about that as you like!â
 63325	
 63326	An awkward silence followed these words. NatÃ¡sha was the first to speak,
 63327	defending her husband and attacking her brother. Her defense was weak
 63328	and inapt but she attained her object. The conversation was resumed, and
 63329	no longer in the unpleasantly hostile tone of Nicholasâ last remark.
 63330	
 63331	When they all got up to go in to supper, little Nicholas BolkÃ³nski went
 63332	up to Pierre, pale and with shining, radiant eyes.
 63333	
 63334	âUncle Pierre, you... no... If Papa were alive... would he agree with
 63335	you?â he asked.
 63336	
 63337	And Pierre suddenly realized what a special, independent, complex, and
 63338	powerful process of thought and feeling must have been going on in
 63339	this boy during that conversation, and remembering all he had said he
 63340	regretted that the lad should have heard him. He had, however, to give
 63341	him an answer.
 63342	
 63343	âYes, I think so,â he said reluctantly, and left the study.
 63344	
 63345	The lad looked down and seemed now for the first time to notice what he
 63346	had done to the things on the table. He flushed and went up to Nicholas.
 63347	
 63348	âUncle, forgive me, I did that... unintentionally,â he said, pointing to
 63349	the broken sealing wax and pens.
 63350	
 63351	Nicholas started angrily.
 63352	
 63353	âAll right, all right,â he said, throwing the bits under the table.
 63354	
 63355	And evidently suppressing his vexation with difficulty, he turned away
 63356	from the boy.
 63357	
 63358	âYou ought not to have been here at all,â he said.
 63359	
 63360	
 63361	
 63362	
 63363	
 63364	CHAPTER XV
 63365	
 63366	The conversation at supper was not about politics or societies, but
 63367	turned on the subject Nicholas liked bestârecollections of 1812. DenÃ­sov
 63368	started these and Pierre was particularly agreeable and amusing about
 63369	them. The family separated on the most friendly terms.
 63370	
 63371	After supper Nicholas, having undressed in his study and given
 63372	instructions to the steward who had been waiting for him, went to the
 63373	bedroom in his dressing gown, where he found his wife still at her
 63374	table, writing.
 63375	
 63376	âWhat are you writing, Mary?â Nicholas asked.
 63377	
 63378	Countess Mary blushed. She was afraid that what she was writing would
 63379	not be understood or approved by her husband.
 63380	
 63381	She had wanted to conceal what she was writing from him, but at the same
 63382	time was glad he had surprised her at it and that she would now have to
 63383	tell him.
 63384	
 63385	âA diary, Nicholas,â she replied, handing him a blue exercise book
 63386	filled with her firm, bold writing.
 63387	
 63388	âA diary?â Nicholas repeated with a shade of irony, and he took up the
 63389	book.
 63390	
 63391	It was in French.
 63392	
 63393	
 63394	December 4. Today when AndrÃºsha (her eldest boy) woke up he did not
 63395	wish to dress and Mademoiselle Louise sent for me. He was naughty and
 63396	obstinate. I tried threats, but he only grew angrier. Then I took the
 63397	matter in hand: I left him alone and began with nurseâs help to get the
 63398	other children up, telling him that I did not love him. For a long time
 63399	he was silent, as if astonished, then he jumped out of bed, ran to me in
 63400	his shirt, and sobbed so that I could not calm him for a long time.
 63401	It was plain that what troubled him most was that he had grieved me.
 63402	Afterwards in the evening when I gave him his ticket, he again began
 63403	crying piteously and kissing me. One can do anything with him by
 63404	tenderness.
 63405	
 63406	
 63407	âWhat is a âticketâ?â Nicholas inquired.
 63408	
 63409	âI have begun giving the elder ones marks every evening, showing how
 63410	they have behaved.â
 63411	
 63412	Nicholas looked into the radiant eyes that were gazing at him, and
 63413	continued to turn over the pages and read. In the diary was set down
 63414	everything in the childrenâs lives that seemed noteworthy to their
 63415	mother as showing their characters or suggesting general reflections
 63416	on educational methods. They were for the most part quite insignificant
 63417	trifles, but did not seem so to the mother or to the father either, now
 63418	that he read this diary about his children for the first time.
 63419	
 63420	Under the date â5â was entered:
 63421	
 63422	
 63423	MÃ­tya was naughty at table. Papa said he was to have no pudding. He had
 63424	none, but looked so unhappily and greedily at the others while they were
 63425	eating! I think that punishment by depriving children of sweets only
 63426	develops their greediness. Must tell Nicholas this.
 63427	
 63428	Nicholas put down the book and looked at his wife. The radiant eyes
 63429	gazed at him questioningly: would he approve or disapprove of her
 63430	diary? There could be no doubt not only of his approval but also of his
 63431	admiration for his wife.
 63432	
 63433	Perhaps it need not be done so pedantically, thought Nicholas, or even
 63434	done at all, but this untiring, continual spiritual effort of which the
 63435	sole aim was the childrenâs moral welfare delighted him. Had Nicholas
 63436	been able to analyze his feelings he would have found that his steady,
 63437	tender, and proud love of his wife rested on his feeling of wonder at
 63438	her spirituality and at the lofty moral world, almost beyond his reach,
 63439	in which she had her being.
 63440	
 63441	He was proud of her intelligence and goodness, recognized his own
 63442	insignificance beside her in the spiritual world, and rejoiced all the
 63443	more that she with such a soul not only belonged to him but was part of
 63444	himself.
 63445	
 63446	âI quite, quite approve, my dearest!â said he with a significant look,
 63447	and after a short pause he added: âAnd I behaved badly today. You
 63448	werenât in the study. We began disputingâPierre and Iâand I lost my
 63449	temper. But he is impossible: such a child! I donât know what would
 63450	become of him if NatÃ¡sha didnât keep him in hand.... Have you any idea
 63451	why he went to Petersburg? They have formed...â
 63452	
 63453	âYes, I know,â said Countess Mary. âNatÃ¡sha told me.â
 63454	
 63455	âWell, then, you know,â Nicholas went on, growing hot at the mere
 63456	recollection of their discussion, âhe wanted to convince me that it is
 63457	every honest manâs duty to go against the government, and that the oath
 63458	of allegiance and duty... I am sorry you werenât there. They all fell on
 63459	meâDenÃ­sov and NatÃ¡sha... NatÃ¡sha is absurd. How she rules over him! And
 63460	yet there need only be a discussion and she has no words of her own
 63461	but only repeats his sayings...â added Nicholas, yielding to that
 63462	irresistible inclination which tempts us to judge those nearest and
 63463	dearest to us. He forgot that what he was saying about NatÃ¡sha could
 63464	have been applied word for word to himself in relation to his wife.
 63465	
 63466	âYes, I have noticed that,â said Countess Mary.
 63467	
 63468	âWhen I told him that duty and the oath were above everything, he
 63469	started proving goodness knows what! A pity you were not thereâwhat
 63470	would you have said?â
 63471	
 63472	âAs I see it you were quite right, and I told NatÃ¡sha so. Pierre says
 63473	everybody is suffering, tortured, and being corrupted, and that it
 63474	is our duty to help our neighbor. Of course he is right there,â said
 63475	Countess Mary, âbut he forgets that we have other duties nearer to us,
 63476	duties indicated to us by God Himself, and that though we might expose
 63477	ourselves to risks we must not risk our children.â
 63478	
 63479	âYes, thatâs it! Thatâs just what I said to him,â put in Nicholas, who
 63480	fancied he really had said it. âBut they insisted on their own view:
 63481	love of oneâs neighbor and Christianityâand all this in the presence of
 63482	young Nicholas, who had gone into my study and broke all my things.â
 63483	
 63484	âAh, Nicholas, do you know I am often troubled about little Nicholas,â
 63485	said Countess Mary. âHe is such an exceptional boy. I am afraid I
 63486	neglect him in favor of my own: we all have children and relations while
 63487	he has no one. He is constantly alone with his thoughts.â
 63488	
 63489	âWell, I donât think you need reproach yourself on his account. All that
 63490	the fondest mother could do for her son you have done and are doing for
 63491	him, and of course I am glad of it. He is a fine lad, a fine lad! This
 63492	evening he listened to Pierre in a sort of trance, and fancyâas we were
 63493	going in to supper I looked and he had broken everything on my table to
 63494	bits, and he told me of it himself at once! I never knew him to tell an
 63495	untruth. A fine lad, a fine lad!â repeated Nicholas, who at heart was
 63496	not fond of Nicholas BolkÃ³nski but was always anxious to recognize that
 63497	he was a fine lad.
 63498	
 63499	âStill, I am not the same as his own mother,â said Countess Mary. âI
 63500	feel I am not the same and it troubles me. A wonderful boy, but I am
 63501	dreadfully afraid for him. It would be good for him to have companions.â
 63502	
 63503	âWell it wonât be for long. Next summer Iâll take him to Petersburg,â
 63504	said Nicholas. âYes, Pierre always was a dreamer and always will be,â
 63505	he continued, returning to the talk in the study which had evidently
 63506	disturbed him. âWell, what business is it of mine what goes on
 63507	thereâwhether ArakchÃ©ev is bad, and all that? What business was it of
 63508	mine when I married and was so deep in debt that I was threatened with
 63509	prison, and had a mother who could not see or understand it? And
 63510	then there are you and the children and our affairs. Is it for my own
 63511	pleasure that I am at the farm or in the office from morning to night?
 63512	No, but I know I must work to comfort my mother, to repay you, and not
 63513	to leave the children such beggars as I was.â
 63514	
 63515	Countess Mary wanted to tell him that man does not live by bread alone
 63516	and that he attached too much importance to these matters. But she knew
 63517	she must not say this and that it would be useless to do so. She only
 63518	took his hand and kissed it. He took this as a sign of approval and
 63519	a confirmation of his thoughts, and after a few minutesâ reflection
 63520	continued to think aloud.
 63521	
 63522	âYou know, Mary, today Elias MitrofÃ¡nychâ (this was his overseer) âcame
 63523	back from the TambÃ³v estate and told me they are already offering eighty
 63524	thousand rubles for the forest.â
 63525	
 63526	And with an eager face Nicholas began to speak of the possibility of
 63527	repurchasing OtrÃ¡dnoe before long, and added: âAnother ten years of life
 63528	and I shall leave the children... in an excellent position.â
 63529	
 63530	Countess Mary listened to her husband and understood all that he told
 63531	her. She knew that when he thought aloud in this way he would sometimes
 63532	ask her what he had been saying, and be vexed if he noticed that she
 63533	had been thinking about something else. But she had to force herself to
 63534	attend, for what he was saying did not interest her at all. She looked
 63535	at him and did not think, but felt, about something different. She felt
 63536	a submissive tender love for this man who would never understand all
 63537	that she understood, and this seemed to make her love for him still
 63538	stronger and added a touch of passionate tenderness. Besides this
 63539	feeling which absorbed her altogether and hindered her from following
 63540	the details of her husbandâs plans, thoughts that had no connection with
 63541	what he was saying flitted through her mind. She thought of her nephew.
 63542	Her husbandâs account of the boyâs agitation while Pierre was speaking
 63543	struck her forcibly, and various traits of his gentle, sensitive
 63544	character recurred to her mind; and while thinking of her nephew she
 63545	thought also of her own children. She did not compare them with him, but
 63546	compared her feeling for them with her feeling for him, and felt
 63547	with regret that there was something lacking in her feeling for young
 63548	Nicholas.
 63549	
 63550	Sometimes it seemed to her that this difference arose from the
 63551	difference in their ages, but she felt herself to blame toward him and
 63552	promised in her heart to do better and to accomplish the impossibleâin
 63553	this life to love her husband, her children, little Nicholas, and all
 63554	her neighbors, as Christ loved mankind. Countess Maryâs soul always
 63555	strove toward the infinite, the eternal, and the absolute, and could
 63556	therefore never be at peace. A stern expression of the lofty, secret
 63557	suffering of a soul burdened by the body appeared on her face. Nicholas
 63558	gazed at her. âO God! What will become of us if she dies, as I always
 63559	fear when her face is like that?â thought he, and placing himself before
 63560	the icon he began to say his evening prayers.
 63561	
 63562

 63564	
 63565	
 63566	CHAPTER XVI
 63567	
 63568	NatÃ¡sha and Pierre, left alone, also began to talk as only a husband
 63569	and wife can talk, that is, with extraordinary clearness and rapidity,
 63570	understanding and expressing each otherâs thoughts in ways contrary to
 63571	all rules of logic, without premises, deductions, or conclusions, and in
 63572	a quite peculiar way. NatÃ¡sha was so used to this kind of talk with her
 63573	husband that for her it was the surest sign of something being wrong
 63574	between them if Pierre followed a line of logical reasoning. When he
 63575	began proving anything, or talking argumentatively and calmly and she,
 63576	led on by his example, began to do the same, she knew that they were on
 63577	the verge of a quarrel.
 63578	
 63579	From the moment they were alone and NatÃ¡sha came up to him with
 63580	wide-open happy eyes, and quickly seizing his head pressed it to her
 63581	bosom, saying: âNow you are all mine, mine! You wonât escape!ââfrom that
 63582	moment this conversation began, contrary to all the laws of logic and
 63583	contrary to them because quite different subjects were talked about at
 63584	one and the same time. This simultaneous discussion of many topics did
 63585	not prevent a clear understanding but on the contrary was the surest
 63586	sign that they fully understood one another.
 63587	
 63588	Just as in a dream when all is uncertain, unreasoning, and
 63589	contradictory, except the feeling that guides the dream, so in this
 63590	intercourse contrary to all laws of reason, the words themselves were
 63591	not consecutive and clear but only the feeling that prompted them.
 63592	
 63593	NatÃ¡sha spoke to Pierre about her brotherâs life and doings, of how she
 63594	had suffered and lacked life during his own absence, and of how she
 63595	was fonder than ever of Mary, and how Mary was in every way better than
 63596	herself. In saying this NatÃ¡sha was sincere in acknowledging Maryâs
 63597	superiority, but at the same time by saying it she made a demand on
 63598	Pierre that he should, all the same, prefer her to Mary and to all
 63599	other women, and that now, especially after having seen many women in
 63600	Petersburg, he should tell her so afresh.
 63601	
 63602	Pierre, answering NatÃ¡shaâs words, told her how intolerable it had been
 63603	for him to meet ladies at dinners and balls in Petersburg.
 63604	
 63605	âI have quite lost the knack of talking to ladies,â he said. âIt was
 63606	simply dull. Besides, I was very busy.â
 63607	
 63608	NatÃ¡sha looked intently at him and went on:
 63609	
 63610	âMary is so splendid,â she said. âHow she understands children! It is as
 63611	if she saw straight into their souls. Yesterday, for instance, MÃ­tya was
 63612	naughty...â
 63613	
 63614	âHow like his father he is,â Pierre interjected.
 63615	
 63616	NatÃ¡sha knew why he mentioned MÃ­tyaâs likeness to Nicholas: the
 63617	recollection of his dispute with his brother-in-law was unpleasant and
 63618	he wanted to know what NatÃ¡sha thought of it.
 63619	
 63620	âNicholas has the weakness of never agreeing with anything not generally
 63621	accepted. But I understand that you value what opens up a fresh line,â
 63622	said she, repeating words Pierre had once uttered.
 63623	
 63624	âNo, the chief point is that to Nicholas ideas and discussions are
 63625	an amusementâalmost a pastime,â said Pierre. âFor instance, he is
 63626	collecting a library and has made it a rule not to buy a new book
 63627	till he has read what he had already boughtâSismondi and Rousseau and
 63628	Montesquieu,â he added with a smile. âYou know how much I...â he began
 63629	to soften down what he had said; but NatÃ¡sha interrupted him to show
 63630	that this was unnecessary.
 63631	
 63632	âSo you say ideas are an amusement to him....â
 63633	
 63634	âYes, and for me nothing else is serious. All the time in Petersburg I
 63635	saw everyone as in a dream. When I am taken up by a thought, all else is
 63636	mere amusement.â
 63637	
 63638	âAh, Iâm so sorry I wasnât there when you met the children,â said
 63639	NatÃ¡sha. âWhich was most delighted? Lisa, Iâm sure.â
 63640	
 63641	âYes,â Pierre replied, and went on with what was in his mind. âNicholas
 63642	says we ought not to think. But I canât help it. Besides, when I was in
 63643	Petersburg I felt (I can say this to you) that the whole affair would go
 63644	to pieces without meâeveryone was pulling his own way. But I succeeded
 63645	in uniting them all; and then my idea is so clear and simple. You see,
 63646	I donât say that we ought to oppose this and that. We may be mistaken.
 63647	What I say is: âJoin hands, you who love the right, and let there be but
 63648	one bannerâthat of active virtue.â Prince SergÃ©y is a fine fellow and
 63649	clever.â
 63650	
 63651	NatÃ¡sha would have had no doubt as to the greatness of Pierreâs idea,
 63652	but one thing disconcerted her. âCan a man so important and necessary to
 63653	society be also my husband? How did this happen?â She wished to express
 63654	this doubt to him. âNow who could decide whether he is really cleverer
 63655	than all the others?â she asked herself, and passed in review all those
 63656	whom Pierre most respected. Judging by what he had said there was no one
 63657	he had respected so highly as PlatÃ³n KaratÃ¡ev.
 63658	
 63659	âDo you know what I am thinking about?â she asked. âAbout PlatÃ³n
 63660	KaratÃ¡ev. Would he have approved of you now, do you think?â
 63661	
 63662	Pierre was not at all surprised at this question. He understood his
 63663	wifeâs line of thought.
 63664	
 63665	âPlatÃ³n KaratÃ¡ev?â he repeated, and pondered, evidently sincerely
 63666	trying to imagine KaratÃ¡evâs opinion on the subject. âHe would not have
 63667	understood... yet perhaps he would.â
 63668	
 63669	âI love you awfully!â NatÃ¡sha suddenly said. âAwfully, awfully!â
 63670	
 63671	âNo, he would not have approved,â said Pierre, after reflection. âWhat
 63672	he would have approved of is our family life. He was always so anxious
 63673	to find seemliness, happiness, and peace in everything, and I should
 63674	have been proud to let him see us. There nowâyou talk of my absence,
 63675	but you wouldnât believe what a special feeling I have for you after a
 63676	separation....â
 63677	
 63678	âYes, I should think...â NatÃ¡sha began.
 63679	
 63680	âNo, itâs not that. I never leave off loving you. And one couldnât love
 63681	more, but this is something special.... Yes, of courseââ he did not
 63682	finish because their eyes meeting said the rest.
 63683	
 63684	âWhat nonsense it is,â NatÃ¡sha suddenly exclaimed, âabout honeymoons,
 63685	and that the greatest happiness is at first! On the contrary, now is
 63686	the best of all. If only you did not go away! Do you remember how
 63687	we quarreled? And it was always my fault. Always mine. And what we
 63688	quarreled aboutâI donât even remember!â
 63689	
 63690	âAlways about the same thing,â said Pierre with a smile. âJealo...â
 63691	
 63692	âDonât say it! I canât bear it!â NatÃ¡sha cried, and her eyes glittered
 63693	coldly and vindictively. âDid you see her?â she added, after a pause.
 63694	
 63695	âNo, and if I had I shouldnât have recognized her.â
 63696	
 63697	They were silent for a while.
 63698	
 63699	âOh, do you know? While you were talking in the study I was looking at
 63700	you,â NatÃ¡sha began, evidently anxious to disperse the cloud that had
 63701	come over them. âYou are as like him as two peasâlike the boy.â (She
 63702	meant her little son.) âOh, itâs time to go to him.... The milkâs
 63703	come.... But Iâm sorry to leave you.â
 63704	
 63705	They were silent for a few seconds. Then suddenly turning to one
 63706	another at the same time they both began to speak. Pierre began with
 63707	self-satisfaction and enthusiasm, NatÃ¡sha with a quiet, happy smile.
 63708	Having interrupted one another they both stopped to let the other
 63709	continue.
 63710	
 63711	âNo. What did you say? Go on, go on.â
 63712	
 63713	âNo, you go on, I was talking nonsense,â said NatÃ¡sha.
 63714	
 63715	Pierre finished what he had begun. It was the sequel to his complacent
 63716	reflections on his success in Petersburg. At that moment it seemed to
 63717	him that he was chosen to give a new direction to the whole of Russian
 63718	society and to the whole world.
 63719	
 63720	âI only wished to say that ideas that have great results are always
 63721	simple ones. My whole idea is that if vicious people are united and
 63722	constitute a power, then honest folk must do the same. Now thatâs simple
 63723	enough.â
 63724	
 63725	âYes.â
 63726	
 63727	âAnd what were you going to say?â
 63728	
 63729	âI? Only nonsense.â
 63730	
 63731	âBut all the same?â
 63732	
 63733	âOh nothing, only a trifle,â said NatÃ¡sha, smiling still more brightly.
 63734	âI only wanted to tell you about PÃ©tya: today nurse was coming to take
 63735	him from me, and he laughed, shut his eyes, and clung to me. Iâm sure
 63736	he thought he was hiding. Awfully sweet! There, now heâs crying. Well,
 63737	good-by!â and she left the room.
 63738	
 63739	
 63740	Meanwhile downstairs in young Nicholas BolkÃ³nskiâs bedroom a little lamp
 63741	was burning as usual. (The boy was afraid of the dark and they could
 63742	not cure him of it.) Dessalles slept propped up on four pillows and his
 63743	Roman nose emitted sounds of rhythmic snoring. Little Nicholas, who had
 63744	just waked up in a cold perspiration, sat up in bed and gazed before him
 63745	with wide-open eyes. He had awaked from a terrible dream. He had dreamed
 63746	that he and Uncle Pierre, wearing helmets such as were depicted in
 63747	his Plutarch, were leading a huge army. The army was made up of white
 63748	slanting lines that filled the air like the cobwebs that float about in
 63749	autumn and which Dessalles called les fils de la ViÃ¨rge. In front was
 63750	Glory, which was similar to those threads but rather thicker. He and
 63751	Pierre were borne along lightly and joyously, nearer and nearer to their
 63752	goal. Suddenly the threads that moved them began to slacken and become
 63753	entangled and it grew difficult to move. And Uncle Nicholas stood before
 63754	them in a stern and threatening attitude.
 63755	
 63756	âHave you done this?â he said, pointing to some broken sealing wax and
 63757	pens. âI loved you, but I have orders from ArakchÃ©ev and will kill
 63758	the first of you who moves forward.â Little Nicholas turned to look
 63759	at Pierre but Pierre was no longer there. In his place was his
 63760	fatherâPrince Andrewâand his father had neither shape nor form, but he
 63761	existed, and when little Nicholas perceived him he grew faint with love:
 63762	he felt himself powerless, limp, and formless. His father caressed and
 63763	pitied him. But Uncle Nicholas came nearer and nearer to them. Terror
 63764	seized young Nicholas and he awoke.
 63765	
 63766	âMy father!â he thought. (Though there were two good portraits of Prince
 63767	Andrew in the house, Nicholas never imagined him in human form.) âMy
 63768	father has been with me and caressed me. He approved of me and of Uncle
 63769	Pierre. Whatever he may tell me, I will do it. Mucius Scaevola burned
 63770	his hand. Why should not the same sort of thing happen to me? I know
 63771	they want me to learn. And I will learn. But someday I shall have
 63772	finished learning, and then I will do something. I only pray God that
 63773	something may happen to me such as happened to Plutarchâs men, and I
 63774	will act as they did. I will do better. Everyone shall know me, love me,
 63775	and be delighted with me!â And suddenly his bosom heaved with sobs and
 63776	he began to cry.
 63777	
 63778	âAre you ill?â he heard Dessallesâ voice asking.
 63779	
 63780	âNo,â answered Nicholas, and lay back on his pillow.
 63781	
 63782	âHe is good and kind and I am fond of him!â he thought of Dessalles.
 63783	âBut Uncle Pierre! Oh, what a wonderful man he is! And my father? Oh,
 63784	Father, Father! Yes, I will do something with which even he would be
 63785	satisfied....â
 63786	
 63787	
 63788	
 63789	
 63790	
 63791	SECOND EPILOGUE
 63792	
 63793	
 63794	
 63795	
 63796	
 63797	CHAPTER I
 63798	
 63799	History is the life of nations and of humanity. To seize and put into
 63800	words, to describe directly the life of humanity or even of a single
 63801	nation, appears impossible.
 63802	
 63803	The ancient historians all employed one and the same method to describe
 63804	and seize the apparently elusiveâthe life of a people. They described
 63805	the activity of individuals who ruled the people, and regarded the
 63806	activity of those men as representing the activity of the whole nation.
 63807	
 63808	The question: how did individuals make nations act as they wished and by
 63809	what was the will of these individuals themselves guided? the ancients
 63810	met by recognizing a divinity which subjected the nations to the will of
 63811	a chosen man, and guided the will of that chosen man so as to accomplish
 63812	ends that were predestined.
 63813	
 63814	For the ancients these questions were solved by a belief in the direct
 63815	participation of the Deity in human affairs.
 63816	
 63817	Modern history, in theory, rejects both these principles.
 63818	
 63819	It would seem that having rejected the belief of the ancients in manâs
 63820	subjection to the Deity and in a predetermined aim toward which nations
 63821	are led, modern history should study not the manifestations of power but
 63822	the causes that produce it. But modern history has not done this. Having
 63823	in theory rejected the view held by the ancients, it still follows them
 63824	in practice.
 63825	
 63826	Instead of men endowed with divine authority and directly guided by
 63827	the will of God, modern history has given us either heroes endowed with
 63828	extraordinary, superhuman capacities, or simply men of very various
 63829	kinds, from monarchs to journalists, who lead the masses. Instead of the
 63830	former divinely appointed aims of the Jewish, Greek, or Roman nations,
 63831	which ancient historians regarded as representing the progress of
 63832	humanity, modern history has postulated its own aimsâthe welfare of the
 63833	French, German, or English people, or, in its highest abstraction, the
 63834	welfare and civilization of humanity in general, by which is usually
 63835	meant that of the peoples occupying a small northwesterly portion of a
 63836	large continent.
 63837	
 63838	Modern history has rejected the beliefs of the ancients without
 63839	replacing them by a new conception, and the logic of the situation has
 63840	obliged the historians, after they had apparently rejected the divine
 63841	authority of the kings and the âfateâ of the ancients, to reach the same
 63842	conclusion by another road, that is, to recognize (1) nations guided
 63843	by individual men, and (2) the existence of a known aim to which these
 63844	nations and humanity at large are tending.
 63845	
 63846	At the basis of the works of all the modern historians from Gibbon to
 63847	Buckle, despite their seeming disagreements and the apparent novelty of
 63848	their outlooks, lie those two old, unavoidable assumptions.
 63849	
 63850	In the first place the historian describes the activity of individuals
 63851	who in his opinion have directed humanity (one historian considers
 63852	only monarchs, generals, and ministers as being such men, while another
 63853	includes also orators, learned men, reformers, philosophers, and poets).
 63854	Secondly, it is assumed that the goal toward which humanity is being led
 63855	is known to the historians: to one of them this goal is the greatness of
 63856	the Roman, Spanish, or French realm; to another it is liberty, equality,
 63857	and a certain kind of civilization of a small corner of the world called
 63858	Europe.
 63859	
 63860	In 1789 a ferment arises in Paris; it grows, spreads, and is expressed
 63861	by a movement of peoples from west to east. Several times it moves
 63862	eastward and collides with a countermovement from the east westward.
 63863	In 1812 it reaches its extreme limit, Moscow, and then, with remarkable
 63864	symmetry, a countermovement occurs from east to west, attracting to
 63865	it, as the first movement had done, the nations of middle Europe. The
 63866	counter movement reaches the starting point of the first movement in the
 63867	westâParisâand subsides.
 63868	
 63869	During that twenty-year period an immense number of fields were left
 63870	untilled, houses were burned, trade changed its direction, millions
 63871	of men migrated, were impoverished, or were enriched, and millions
 63872	of Christian men professing the law of love of their fellows slew one
 63873	another.
 63874	
 63875	What does all this mean? Why did it happen? What made those people burn
 63876	houses and slay their fellow men? What were the causes of these events?
 63877	What force made men act so? These are the instinctive, plain, and
 63878	most legitimate questions humanity asks itself when it encounters the
 63879	monuments and tradition of that period.
 63880	
 63881	For a reply to these questions the common sense of mankind turns to the
 63882	science of history, whose aim is to enable nations and humanity to know
 63883	themselves.
 63884	
 63885	If history had retained the conception of the ancients it would have
 63886	said that God, to reward or punish his people, gave Napoleon power and
 63887	directed his will to the fulfillment of the divine ends, and that reply
 63888	would have been clear and complete. One might believe or disbelieve
 63889	in the divine significance of Napoleon, but for anyone believing in
 63890	it there would have been nothing unintelligible in the history of that
 63891	period, nor would there have been any contradictions.
 63892	
 63893	But modern history cannot give that reply. Science does not admit the
 63894	conception of the ancients as to the direct participation of the Deity
 63895	in human affairs, and therefore history ought to give other answers.
 63896	
 63897	Modern history replying to these questions says: you want to know what
 63898	this movement means, what caused it, and what force produced these
 63899	events? Then listen:
 63900	
 63901	âLouis XIV was a very proud and self-confident man; he had such and such
 63902	mistresses and such and such ministers and he ruled France badly. His
 63903	descendants were weak men and they too ruled France badly. And they had
 63904	such and such favorites and such and such mistresses. Moreover, certain
 63905	men wrote some books at that time. At the end of the eighteenth century
 63906	there were a couple of dozen men in Paris who began to talk about all
 63907	men being free and equal. This caused people all over France to begin
 63908	to slash at and drown one another. They killed the king and many other
 63909	people. At that time there was in France a man of geniusâNapoleon. He
 63910	conquered everybody everywhereâthat is, he killed many people because
 63911	he was a great genius. And for some reason he went to kill Africans, and
 63912	killed them so well and was so cunning and wise that when he returned to
 63913	France he ordered everybody to obey him, and they all obeyed him. Having
 63914	become an Emperor he again went out to kill people in Italy, Austria,
 63915	and Prussia. And there too he killed a great many. In Russia there
 63916	was an Emperor, Alexander, who decided to restore order in Europe and
 63917	therefore fought against Napoleon. In 1807 he suddenly made friends
 63918	with him, but in 1811 they again quarreled and again began killing many
 63919	people. Napoleon led six hundred thousand men into Russia and captured
 63920	Moscow; then he suddenly ran away from Moscow, and the Emperor
 63921	Alexander, helped by the advice of Stein and others, united Europe to
 63922	arm against the disturber of its peace. All Napoleonâs allies suddenly
 63923	became his enemies and their forces advanced against the fresh forces he
 63924	raised. The Allies defeated Napoleon, entered Paris, forced Napoleon to
 63925	abdicate, and sent him to the island of Elba, not depriving him of the
 63926	title of Emperor and showing him every respect, though five years before
 63927	and one year later they all regarded him as an outlaw and a brigand.
 63928	Then Louis XVIII, who till then had been the laughingstock both of the
 63929	French and the Allies, began to reign. And Napoleon, shedding tears
 63930	before his Old Guards, renounced the throne and went into exile. Then
 63931	the skillful statesmen and diplomatists (especially Talleyrand, who
 63932	managed to sit down in a particular chair before anyone else and
 63933	thereby extended the frontiers of France) talked in Vienna and by
 63934	these conversations made the nations happy or unhappy. Suddenly the
 63935	diplomatists and monarchs nearly quarreled and were on the point of
 63936	again ordering their armies to kill one another, but just then Napoleon
 63937	arrived in France with a battalion, and the French, who had been hating
 63938	him, immediately all submitted to him. But the Allied monarchs were
 63939	angry at this and went to fight the French once more. And they defeated
 63940	the genius Napoleon and, suddenly recognizing him as a brigand, sent him
 63941	to the island of St. Helena. And the exile, separated from the beloved
 63942	France so dear to his heart, died a lingering death on that rock and
 63943	bequeathed his great deeds to posterity. But in Europe a reaction
 63944	occurred and the sovereigns once again all began to oppress their
 63945	subjects.â
 63946	
 63947	It would be a mistake to think that this is ironicâa caricature of the
 63948	historical accounts. On the contrary it is a very mild expression of
 63949	the contradictory replies, not meeting the questions, which all the
 63950	historians give, from the compilers of memoirs and the histories
 63951	of separate states to the writers of general histories and the new
 63952	histories of the culture of that period.
 63953	
 63954	The strangeness and absurdity of these replies arise from the fact that
 63955	modern history, like a deaf man, answers questions no one has asked.
 63956	
 63957	If the purpose of history be to give a description of the movement of
 63958	humanity and of the peoples, the first questionâin the absence of a
 63959	reply to which all the rest will be incomprehensibleâis: what is the
 63960	power that moves peoples? To this, modern history laboriously replies
 63961	either that Napoleon was a great genius, or that Louis XIV was very
 63962	proud, or that certain writers wrote certain books.
 63963	
 63964	All that may be so and mankind is ready to agree with it, but it is not
 63965	what was asked. All that would be interesting if we recognized a divine
 63966	power based on itself and always consistently directing its nations
 63967	through Napoleons, Louis-es, and writers; but we do not acknowledge such
 63968	a power, and therefore before speaking about Napoleons, Louis-es, and
 63969	authors, we ought to be shown the connection existing between these men
 63970	and the movement of the nations.
 63971	
 63972	If instead of a divine power some other force has appeared, it should
 63973	be explained in what this new force consists, for the whole interest of
 63974	history lies precisely in that force.
 63975	
 63976	History seems to assume that this force is self-evident and known to
 63977	everyone. But in spite of every desire to regard it as known, anyone
 63978	reading many historical works cannot help doubting whether this new
 63979	force, so variously understood by the historians themselves, is really
 63980	quite well known to everybody.
 63981	
 63982	
 63983	
 63984	
 63985	
 63986	CHAPTER II
 63987	
 63988	What force moves the nations?
 63989	
 63990	Biographical historians and historians of separate nations understand
 63991	this force as a power inherent in heroes and rulers. In their narration
 63992	events occur solely by the will of a Napoleon, and Alexander, or in
 63993	general of the persons they describe. The answers given by this kind
 63994	of historian to the question of what force causes events to happen are
 63995	satisfactory only as long as there is but one historian to each event.
 63996	As soon as historians of different nationalities and tendencies begin
 63997	to describe the same event, the replies they give immediately lose all
 63998	meaning, for this force is understood by them all not only differently
 63999	but often in quite contradictory ways. One historian says that an
 64000	event was produced by Napoleonâs power, another that it was produced by
 64001	Alexanderâs, a third that it was due to the power of some other person.
 64002	Besides this, historians of that kind contradict each other even
 64003	in their statement as to the force on which the authority of some
 64004	particular person was based. Thiers, a Bonapartist, says that Napoleonâs
 64005	power was based on his virtue and genius. Lanfrey, a Republican, says it
 64006	was based on his trickery and deception of the people. So the historians
 64007	of this class, by mutually destroying one anotherâs positions, destroy
 64008	the understanding of the force which produces events, and furnish no
 64009	reply to historyâs essential question.
 64010	
 64011	Writers of universal history who deal with all the nations seem to
 64012	recognize how erroneous is the specialist historiansâ view of the force
 64013	which produces events. They do not recognize it as a power inherent in
 64014	heroes and rulers, but as the resultant of a multiplicity of variously
 64015	directed forces. In describing a war or the subjugation of a people, a
 64016	general historian looks for the cause of the event not in the power
 64017	of one man, but in the interaction of many persons connected with the
 64018	event.
 64019	
 64020	According to this view the power of historical personages, represented
 64021	as the product of many forces, can no longer, it would seem, be regarded
 64022	as a force that itself produces events. Yet in most cases universal
 64023	historians still employ the conception of power as a force that itself
 64024	produces events, and treat it as their cause. In their exposition, an
 64025	historic character is first the product of his time, and his power only
 64026	the resultant of various forces, and then his power is itself a force
 64027	producing events. Gervinus, Schlosser, and others, for instance, at one
 64028	time prove Napoleon to be a product of the Revolution, of the ideas of
 64029	1789 and so forth, and at another plainly say that the campaign of 1812
 64030	and other things they do not like were simply the product of Napoleonâs
 64031	misdirected will, and that the very ideas of 1789 were arrested in their
 64032	development by Napoleonâs caprice. The ideas of the Revolution and the
 64033	general temper of the age produced Napoleonâs power. But Napoleonâs
 64034	power suppressed the ideas of the Revolution and the general temper of
 64035	the age.
 64036	
 64037	This curious contradiction is not accidental. Not only does it occur at
 64038	every step, but the universal historiansâ accounts are all made up of
 64039	a chain of such contradictions. This contradiction occurs because after
 64040	entering the field of analysis the universal historians stop halfway.
 64041	
 64042	To find component forces equal to the composite or resultant force, the
 64043	sum of the components must equal the resultant. This condition is never
 64044	observed by the universal historians, and so to explain the resultant
 64045	forces they are obliged to admit, in addition to the insufficient
 64046	components, another unexplained force affecting the resultant action.
 64047	
 64048	Specialist historians describing the campaign of 1813 or the restoration
 64049	of the Bourbons plainly assert that these events were produced by the
 64050	will of Alexander. But the universal historian Gervinus, refuting this
 64051	opinion of the specialist historian, tries to prove that the campaign of
 64052	1813 and the restoration of the Bourbons were due to other things beside
 64053	Alexanderâs willâsuch as the activity of Stein, Metternich, Madame de
 64054	StaÃ«l, Talleyrand, Fichte, Chateaubriand, and others. The historian
 64055	evidently decomposes Alexanderâs power into the components: Talleyrand,
 64056	Chateaubriand, and the restâbut the sum of the components, that is,
 64057	the interactions of Chateaubriand, Talleyrand, Madame de StaÃ«l, and the
 64058	others, evidently does not equal the resultant, namely the phenomenon
 64059	of millions of Frenchmen submitting to the Bourbons. That Chateaubriand,
 64060	Madame de StaÃ«l, and others spoke certain words to one another only
 64061	affected their mutual relations but does not account for the submission
 64062	of millions. And therefore to explain how from these relations of theirs
 64063	the submission of millions of people resultedâthat is, how component
 64064	forces equal to one A gave a resultant equal to a thousand times Aâthe
 64065	historian is again obliged to fall back on powerâthe force he had
 64066	deniedâand to recognize it as the resultant of the forces, that is, he
 64067	has to admit an unexplained force acting on the resultant. And that is
 64068	just what the universal historians do, and consequently they not only
 64069	contradict the specialist historians but contradict themselves.
 64070	
 64071	Peasants having no clear idea of the cause of rain, say, according to
 64072	whether they want rain or fine weather: âThe wind has blown the clouds
 64073	away,â or, âThe wind has brought up the clouds.â And in the same way the
 64074	universal historians sometimes, when it pleases them and fits in with
 64075	their theory, say that power is the result of events, and sometimes,
 64076	when they want to prove something else, say that power produces events.
 64077	
 64078	A third class of historiansâthe so-called historians of
 64079	cultureâfollowing the path laid down by the universal historians who
 64080	sometimes accept writers and ladies as forces producing eventsâagain
 64081	take that force to be something quite different. They see it in what is
 64082	called cultureâin mental activity.
 64083	
 64084	The historians of culture are quite consistent in regard to their
 64085	progenitors, the writers of universal histories, for if historical
 64086	events may be explained by the fact that certain persons treated one
 64087	another in such and such ways, why not explain them by the fact that
 64088	such and such people wrote such and such books? Of the immense number of
 64089	indications accompanying every vital phenomenon, these historians select
 64090	the indication of intellectual activity and say that this indication is
 64091	the cause. But despite their endeavors to prove that the cause of events
 64092	lies in intellectual activity, only by a great stretch can one admit
 64093	that there is any connection between intellectual activity and the
 64094	movement of peoples, and in no case can one admit that intellectual
 64095	activity controls peopleâs actions, for that view is not confirmed by
 64096	such facts as the very cruel murders of the French Revolution resulting
 64097	from the doctrine of the equality of man, or the very cruel wars and
 64098	executions resulting from the preaching of love.
 64099	
 64100	But even admitting as correct all the cunningly devised arguments with
 64101	which these histories are filledâadmitting that nations are governed by
 64102	some undefined force called an ideaâhistoryâs essential question still
 64103	remains unanswered, and to the former power of monarchs and to the
 64104	influence of advisers and other people introduced by the universal
 64105	historians, another, newer forceâthe ideaâis added, the connection of
 64106	which with the masses needs explanation. It is possible to understand
 64107	that Napoleon had power and so events occurred; with some effort one may
 64108	even conceive that Napoleon together with other influences was the cause
 64109	of an event; but how a book, Le Contrat Social, had the effect of making
 64110	Frenchmen begin to drown one another cannot be understood without an
 64111	explanation of the causal nexus of this new force with the event.
 64112	
 64113	Undoubtedly some relation exists between all who live contemporaneously,
 64114	and so it is possible to find some connection between the intellectual
 64115	activity of men and their historical movements, just as such a
 64116	connection may be found between the movements of humanity and commerce,
 64117	handicraft, gardening, or anything else you please. But why intellectual
 64118	activity is considered by the historians of culture to be the cause or
 64119	expression of the whole historical movement is hard to understand.
 64120	Only the following considerations can have led the historians to such
 64121	a conclusion: (1) that history is written by learned men, and so it is
 64122	natural and agreeable for them to think that the activity of their class
 64123	supplies the basis of the movement of all humanity, just as a similar
 64124	belief is natural and agreeable to traders, agriculturists, and soldiers
 64125	(if they do not express it, that is merely because traders and soldiers
 64126	do not write history), and (2) that spiritual activity, enlightenment,
 64127	civilization, culture, ideas, are all indistinct, indefinite conceptions
 64128	under whose banner it is very easy to use words having a still less
 64129	definite meaning, and which can therefore be readily introduced into any
 64130	theory.
 64131	
 64132	But not to speak of the intrinsic quality of histories of this kind
 64133	(which may possibly even be of use to someone for something) the
 64134	histories of culture, to which all general histories tend more and more
 64135	to approximate, are significant from the fact that after seriously
 64136	and minutely examining various religious, philosophic, and political
 64137	doctrines as causes of events, as soon as they have to describe an
 64138	actual historic event such as the campaign of 1812 for instance, they
 64139	involuntarily describe it as resulting from an exercise of powerâand say
 64140	plainly that that was the result of Napoleonâs will. Speaking so, the
 64141	historians of culture involuntarily contradict themselves, and show that
 64142	the new force they have devised does not account for what happens in
 64143	history, and that history can only be explained by introducing a power
 64144	which they apparently do not recognize.
 64145	
 64146	
 64147	
 64148	
 64149	
 64150	CHAPTER III
 64151	
 64152	A locomotive is moving. Someone asks: âWhat moves it?â A peasant says
 64153	the devil moves it. Another man says the locomotive moves because its
 64154	wheels go round. A third asserts that the cause of its movement lies in
 64155	the smoke which the wind carries away.
 64156	
 64157	The peasant is irrefutable. He has devised a complete explanation. To
 64158	refute him someone would have to prove to him that there is no devil,
 64159	or another peasant would have to explain to him that it is not the devil
 64160	but a German, who moves the locomotive. Only then, as a result of the
 64161	contradiction, will they see that they are both wrong. But the man who
 64162	says that the movement of the wheels is the cause refutes himself, for
 64163	having once begun to analyze he ought to go on and explain further why
 64164	the wheels go round; and till he has reached the ultimate cause of the
 64165	movement of the locomotive in the pressure of steam in the boiler, he
 64166	has no right to stop in his search for the cause. The man who explains
 64167	the movement of the locomotive by the smoke that is carried back has
 64168	noticed that the wheels do not supply an explanation and has taken the
 64169	first sign that occurs to him and in his turn has offered that as an
 64170	explanation.
 64171	
 64172	The only conception that can explain the movement of the locomotive is
 64173	that of a force commensurate with the movement observed.
 64174	
 64175	The only conception that can explain the movement of the peoples is that
 64176	of some force commensurate with the whole movement of the peoples.
 64177	
 64178	Yet to supply this conception various historians take forces of
 64179	different kinds, all of which are incommensurate with the movement
 64180	observed. Some see it as a force directly inherent in heroes, as the
 64181	peasant sees the devil in the locomotive; others as a force resulting
 64182	from several other forces, like the movement of the wheels; others again
 64183	as an intellectual influence, like the smoke that is blown away.
 64184	
 64185	So long as histories are written of separate individuals, whether
 64186	Caesars, Alexanders, Luthers, or Voltaires, and not the histories
 64187	of all, absolutely all those who take part in an event, it is quite
 64188	impossible to describe the movement of humanity without the conception
 64189	of a force compelling men to direct their activity toward a certain end.
 64190	And the only such conception known to historians is that of power.
 64191	
 64192	This conception is the one handle by means of which the material of
 64193	history, as at present expounded, can be dealt with, and anyone who
 64194	breaks that handle off, as Buckle did, without finding some other method
 64195	of treating historical material, merely deprives himself of the one
 64196	possible way of dealing with it. The necessity of the conception of
 64197	power as an explanation of historical events is best demonstrated by
 64198	the universal historians and historians of culture themselves, for they
 64199	professedly reject that conception but inevitably have recourse to it at
 64200	every step.
 64201	
 64202	In dealing with humanityâs inquiry, the science of history up to now
 64203	is like money in circulationâpaper money and coin. The biographies and
 64204	special national histories are like paper money. They can be used and
 64205	can circulate and fulfill their purpose without harm to anyone and even
 64206	advantageously, as long as no one asks what is the security behind them.
 64207	You need only forget to ask how the will of heroes produces events, and
 64208	such histories as Thiersâ will be interesting and instructive and may
 64209	perhaps even possess a tinge of poetry. But just as doubts of the real
 64210	value of paper money arise either because, being easy to make, too much
 64211	of it gets made or because people try to exchange it for gold, so also
 64212	doubts concerning the real value of such histories arise either because
 64213	too many of them are written or because in his simplicity of heart
 64214	someone inquires: by what force did Napoleon do this?âthat is, wants
 64215	to exchange the current paper money for the real gold of actual
 64216	comprehension.
 64217	
 64218	The writers of universal histories and of the history of culture are
 64219	like people who, recognizing the defects of paper money, decide to
 64220	substitute for it money made of metal that has not the specific gravity
 64221	of gold. It may indeed make jingling coin, but will do no more than
 64222	that. Paper money may deceive the ignorant, but nobody is deceived by
 64223	tokens of base metal that have no value but merely jingle. As gold is
 64224	gold only if it is serviceable not merely for exchange but also for use,
 64225	so universal historians will be valuable only when they can reply to
 64226	historyâs essential question: what is power? The universal historians
 64227	give contradictory replies to that question, while the historians of
 64228	culture evade it and answer something quite different. And as counters
 64229	of imitation gold can be used only among a group of people who agree to
 64230	accept them as gold, or among those who do not know the nature of
 64231	gold, so universal historians and historians of culture, not answering
 64232	humanityâs essential question, serve as currency for some purposes of
 64233	their own, only in universities and among the mass of readers who have a
 64234	taste for what they call âserious reading.â

 64239	
 64240	CHAPTER IV
 64241	
 64242	Having abandoned the conception of the ancients as to the divine
 64243	subjection of the will of a nation to some chosen man and the subjection
 64244	of that manâs will to the Deity, history cannot without contradictions
 64245	take a single step till it has chosen one of two things: either a return
 64246	to the former belief in the direct intervention of the Deity in human
 64247	affairs or a definite explanation of the meaning of the force producing
 64248	historical events and termed âpower.â
 64249	
 64250	A return to the first is impossible, the belief has been destroyed; and
 64251	so it is essential to explain what is meant by power.
 64252	
 64253	Napoleon ordered an army to be raised and go to war. We are so
 64254	accustomed to that idea and have become so used to it that the question:
 64255	why did six hundred thousand men go to fight when Napoleon uttered
 64256	certain words, seems to us senseless. He had the power and so what he
 64257	ordered was done.
 64258	
 64259	This reply is quite satisfactory if we believe that the power was given
 64260	him by God. But as soon as we do not admit that, it becomes essential to
 64261	determine what is this power of one man over others.
 64262	
 64263	It cannot be the direct physical power of a strong man over a weak oneâa
 64264	domination based on the application or threat of physical force, like
 64265	the power of Hercules; nor can it be based on the effect of moral force,
 64266	as in their simplicity some historians think who say that the leading
 64267	figures in history are heroes, that is, men gifted with a special
 64268	strength of soul and mind called genius. This power cannot be based on
 64269	the predominance of moral strength, for, not to mention heroes such as
 64270	Napoleon about whose moral qualities opinions differ widely, history
 64271	shows us that neither a Louis XI nor a Metternich, who ruled over
 64272	millions of people, had any particular moral qualities, but on the
 64273	contrary were generally morally weaker than any of the millions they
 64274	ruled over.
 64275	
 64276	If the source of power lies neither in the physical nor in the moral
 64277	qualities of him who possesses it, it must evidently be looked for
 64278	elsewhereâin the relation to the people of the man who wields the power.
 64279	
 64280	And that is how power is understood by the science of jurisprudence,
 64281	that exchange bank of history which offers to exchange historyâs
 64282	understanding of power for true gold.
 64283	
 64284	Power is the collective will of the people transferred, by expressed or
 64285	tacit consent, to their chosen rulers.
 64286	
 64287	In the domain of jurisprudence, which consists of discussions of how a
 64288	state and power might be arranged were it possible for all that to
 64289	be arranged, it is all very clear; but when applied to history that
 64290	definition of power needs explanation.
 64291	
 64292	The science of jurisprudence regards the state and power as the ancients
 64293	regarded fireânamely, as something existing absolutely. But for history,
 64294	the state and power are merely phenomena, just as for modern physics
 64295	fire is not an element but a phenomenon.
 64296	
 64297	From this fundamental difference between the view held by history and
 64298	that held by jurisprudence, it follows that jurisprudence can tell
 64299	minutely how in its opinion power should be constituted and what
 64300	powerâexisting immutably outside timeâis, but to historyâs questions
 64301	about the meaning of the mutations of power in time it can answer
 64302	nothing.
 64303	
 64304	If power be the collective will of the people transferred to their
 64305	ruler, was PugachÃ«v a representative of the will of the people? If not,
 64306	then why was Napoleon I? Why was Napoleon III a criminal when he was
 64307	taken prisoner at Boulogne, and why, later on, were those criminals whom
 64308	he arrested?
 64309	
 64310	Do palace revolutionsâin which sometimes only two or three people take
 64311	partâtransfer the will of the people to a new ruler? In international
 64312	relations, is the will of the people also transferred to their
 64313	conqueror? Was the will of the Confederation of the Rhine transferred
 64314	to Napoleon in 1806? Was the will of the Russian people transferred
 64315	to Napoleon in 1809, when our army in alliance with the French went to
 64316	fight the Austrians?
 64317	
 64318	To these questions three answers are possible:
 64319	
 64320	Either to assume (1) that the will of the people is always
 64321	unconditionally transferred to the ruler or rulers they have chosen, and
 64322	that therefore every emergence of a new power, every struggle
 64323	against the power once appointed, should be absolutely regarded as an
 64324	infringement of the real power; or (2) that the will of the people
 64325	is transferred to the rulers conditionally, under definite and known
 64326	conditions, and to show that all limitations, conflicts, and even
 64327	destructions of power result from a nonobservance by the rulers of the
 64328	conditions under which their power was entrusted to them; or (3) that
 64329	the will of the people is delegated to the rulers conditionally, but
 64330	that the conditions are unknown and indefinite, and that the appearance
 64331	of several authorities, their struggles and their falls, result solely
 64332	from the greater or lesser fulfillment by the rulers of these unknown
 64333	conditions on which the will of the people is transferred from some
 64334	people to others.
 64335	
 64336	And these are the three ways in which the historians do explain the
 64337	relation of the people to their rulers.
 64338	
 64339	Some historiansâthose biographical and specialist historians already
 64340	referred toâin their simplicity failing to understand the question of
 64341	the meaning of power, seem to consider that the collective will of
 64342	the people is unconditionally transferred to historical persons, and
 64343	therefore when describing some single state they assume that particular
 64344	power to be the one absolute and real power, and that any other force
 64345	opposing this is not a power but a violation of powerâmere violence.
 64346	
 64347	Their theory, suitable for primitive and peaceful periods of history,
 64348	has the inconvenienceâin application to complex and stormy periods in
 64349	the life of nations during which various powers arise simultaneously and
 64350	struggle with one anotherâthat a Legitimist historian will prove
 64351	that the National Convention, the Directory, and Bonaparte were mere
 64352	infringers of the true power, while a Republican and a Bonapartist will
 64353	prove: the one that the Convention and the other that the Empire was the
 64354	real power, and that all the others were violations of power.
 64355	Evidently the explanations furnished by these historians being mutually
 64356	contradictory can only satisfy young children.
 64357	
 64358	Recognizing the falsity of this view of history, another set of
 64359	historians say that power rests on a conditional delegation of the will
 64360	of the people to their rulers, and that historical leaders have power
 64361	only conditionally on carrying out the program that the will of the
 64362	people has by tacit agreement prescribed to them. But what this program
 64363	consists in these historians do not say, or if they do they continually
 64364	contradict one another.
 64365	
 64366	Each historian, according to his view of what constitutes a nationâs
 64367	progress, looks for these conditions in the greatness, wealth, freedom,
 64368	or enlightenment of citizens of France or some other country. But not
 64369	to mention the historiansâ contradictions as to the nature of this
 64370	programâor even admitting that some one general program of these
 64371	conditions existsâthe facts of history almost always contradict that
 64372	theory. If the conditions under which power is entrusted consist in the
 64373	wealth, freedom, and enlightenment of the people, how is it that Louis
 64374	XIV and IvÃ¡n the Terrible end their reigns tranquilly, while Louis XVI
 64375	and Charles I are executed by their people? To this question historians
 64376	reply that Louis XIVâs activity, contrary to the program, reacted on
 64377	Louis XVI. But why did it not react on Louis XIV or on Louis XVâwhy
 64378	should it react just on Louis XVI? And what is the time limit for such
 64379	reactions? To these questions there are and can be no answers. Equally
 64380	little does this view explain why for several centuries the collective
 64381	will is not withdrawn from certain rulers and their heirs, and
 64382	then suddenly during a period of fifty years is transferred to the
 64383	Convention, to the Directory, to Napoleon, to Alexander, to Louis XVIII,
 64384	to Napoleon again, to Charles X, to Louis Philippe, to a Republican
 64385	government, and to Napoleon III. When explaining these rapid transfers
 64386	of the peopleâs will from one individual to another, especially in view
 64387	of international relations, conquests, and alliances, the historians are
 64388	obliged to admit that some of these transfers are not normal delegations
 64389	of the peopleâs will but are accidents dependent on cunning, on
 64390	mistakes, on craft, or on the weakness of a diplomatist, a ruler, or a
 64391	party leader. So that the greater part of the events of historyâcivil
 64392	wars, revolutions, and conquestsâare presented by these historians
 64393	not as the results of free transferences of the peopleâs will, but as
 64394	results of the ill-directed will of one or more individuals, that is,
 64395	once again, as usurpations of power. And so these historians also see
 64396	and admit historical events which are exceptions to the theory.
 64397	
 64398	These historians resemble a botanist who, having noticed that some
 64399	plants grow from seeds producing two cotyledons, should insist that all
 64400	that grows does so by sprouting into two leaves, and that the palm, the
 64401	mushroom, and even the oak, which blossom into full growth and no longer
 64402	resemble two leaves, are deviations from the theory.
 64403	
 64404	Historians of the third class assume that the will of the people
 64405	is transferred to historic personages conditionally, but that the
 64406	conditions are unknown to us. They say that historical personages have
 64407	power only because they fulfill the will of the people which has been
 64408	delegated to them.
 64409	
 64410	But in that case, if the force that moves nations lies not in the
 64411	historic leaders but in the nations themselves, what significance have
 64412	those leaders?
 64413	
 64414	The leaders, these historians tell us, express the will of the people:
 64415	the activity of the leaders represents the activity of the people.
 64416	
 64417	But in that case the question arises whether all the activity of the
 64418	leaders serves as an expression of the peopleâs will or only some part
 64419	of it. If the whole activity of the leaders serves as the expression of
 64420	the peopleâs will, as some historians suppose, then all the details
 64421	of the court scandals contained in the biographies of a Napoleon or
 64422	a Catherine serve to express the life of the nation, which is evident
 64423	nonsense; but if it is only some particular side of the activity of an
 64424	historical leader which serves to express the peopleâs life, as other
 64425	so-called âphilosophicalâ historians believe, then to determine which
 64426	side of the activity of a leader expresses the nationâs life, we have
 64427	first of all to know in what the nationâs life consists.
 64428	
 64429	Met by this difficulty historians of that class devise some most
 64430	obscure, impalpable, and general abstraction which can cover all
 64431	conceivable occurrences, and declare this abstraction to be the aim of
 64432	humanityâs movement. The most usual generalizations adopted by almost
 64433	all the historians are: freedom, equality, enlightenment, progress,
 64434	civilization, and culture. Postulating some generalization as the goal
 64435	of the movement of humanity, the historians study the men of whom the
 64436	greatest number of monuments have remained: kings, ministers, generals,
 64437	authors, reformers, popes, and journalists, to the extent to which in
 64438	their opinion these persons have promoted or hindered that abstraction.
 64439	But as it is in no way proved that the aim of humanity does consist in
 64440	freedom, equality, enlightenment, or civilization, and as the connection
 64441	of the people with the rulers and enlighteners of humanity is only based
 64442	on the arbitrary assumption that the collective will of the people is
 64443	always transferred to the men whom we have noticed, it happens that the
 64444	activity of the millions who migrate, burn houses, abandon agriculture,
 64445	and destroy one another never is expressed in the account of the
 64446	activity of some dozen people who did not burn houses, practice
 64447	agriculture, or slay their fellow creatures.
 64448	
 64449	History proves this at every turn. Is the ferment of the peoples of
 64450	the west at the end of the eighteenth century and their drive eastward
 64451	explained by the activity of Louis XIV, XV, and XVI, their mistresses
 64452	and ministers, and by the lives of Napoleon, Rousseau, Diderot,
 64453	Beaumarchais, and others?
 64454	
 64455	Is the movement of the Russian people eastward to KazÃ¡n and Siberia
 64456	expressed by details of the morbid character of IvÃ¡n the Terrible and by
 64457	his correspondence with KÃºrbski?
 64458	
 64459	Is the movement of the peoples at the time of the Crusades explained by
 64460	the life and activity of the Godfreys and the Louis-es and their ladies?
 64461	For us that movement of the peoples from west to east, without
 64462	leaders, with a crowd of vagrants, and with Peter the Hermit, remains
 64463	incomprehensible. And yet more incomprehensible is the cessation of that
 64464	movement when a rational and sacred aim for the Crusadeâthe deliverance
 64465	of Jerusalemâhad been clearly defined by historic leaders. Popes, kings,
 64466	and knights incited the peoples to free the Holy Land; but the people
 64467	did not go, for the unknown cause which had previously impelled them to
 64468	go no longer existed. The history of the Godfreys and the Minnesingers
 64469	can evidently not cover the life of the peoples. And the history of the
 64470	Godfreys and the Minnesingers has remained the history of Godfreys
 64471	and Minnesingers, but the history of the life of the peoples and their
 64472	impulses has remained unknown.
 64473	
 64474	Still less does the history of authors and reformers explain to us the
 64475	life of the peoples.
 64476	
 64477	The history of culture explains to us the impulses and conditions of
 64478	life and thought of a writer or a reformer. We learn that Luther had
 64479	a hot temper and said such and such things; we learn that Rousseau was
 64480	suspicious and wrote such and such books; but we do not learn why after
 64481	the Reformation the peoples massacred one another, nor why during the
 64482	French Revolution they guillotined one another.
 64483	
 64484	If we unite both these kinds of history, as is done by the newest
 64485	historians, we shall have the history of monarchs and writers, but not
 64486	the history of the life of the peoples.
 64487	
 64488	
 64489	
 64490	
 64491	
 64492	CHAPTER V
 64493	
 64494	The life of the nations is not contained in the lives of a few men, for
 64495	the connection between those men and the nations has not been found.
 64496	The theory that this connection is based on the transference of the
 64497	collective will of a people to certain historical personages is an
 64498	hypothesis unconfirmed by the experience of history.
 64499	
 64500	The theory of the transference of the collective will of the people to
 64501	historic persons may perhaps explain much in the domain of jurisprudence
 64502	and be essential for its purposes, but in its application to history, as
 64503	soon as revolutions, conquests, or civil wars occurâthat is, as soon as
 64504	history beginsâthat theory explains nothing.
 64505	
 64506	The theory seems irrefutable just because the act of transference of the
 64507	peopleâs will cannot be verified, for it never occurred.
 64508	
 64509	Whatever happens and whoever may stand at the head of affairs, the
 64510	theory can always say that such and such a person took the lead because
 64511	the collective will was transferred to him.
 64512	
 64513	The replies this theory gives to historical questions are like the
 64514	replies of a man who, watching the movements of a herd of cattle and
 64515	paying no attention to the varying quality of the pasturage in different
 64516	parts of the field, or to the driving of the herdsman, should attribute
 64517	the direction the herd takes to what animal happens to be at its head.
 64518	
 64519	âThe herd goes in that direction because the animal in front leads
 64520	it and the collective will of all the other animals is vested in that
 64521	leader.â This is what historians of the first class sayâthose who assume
 64522	the unconditional transference of the peopleâs will.
 64523	
 64524	âIf the animals leading the herd change, this happens because the
 64525	collective will of all the animals is transferred from one leader to
 64526	another, according to whether the animal is or is not leading them in
 64527	the direction selected by the whole herd.â Such is the reply historians
 64528	who assume that the collective will of the people is delegated to
 64529	rulers under conditions which they regard as known. (With this method
 64530	of observation it often happens that the observer, influenced by the
 64531	direction he himself prefers, regards those as leaders who, owing to the
 64532	peopleâs change of direction, are no longer in front, but on one side,
 64533	or even in the rear.)
 64534	
 64535	âIf the animals in front are continually changing and the direction of
 64536	the whole herd is constantly altered, this is because in order to follow
 64537	a given direction the animals transfer their will to the animals that
 64538	have attracted our attention, and to study the movements of the herd
 64539	we must watch the movements of all the prominent animals moving on all
 64540	sides of the herd.â So say the third class of historians who regard all
 64541	historical persons, from monarchs to journalists, as the expression of
 64542	their age.
 64543	
 64544	The theory of the transference of the will of the people to historic
 64545	persons is merely a paraphraseâa restatement of the question in other
 64546	words.
 64547	
 64548	What causes historical events? Power. What is power? Power is the
 64549	collective will of the people transferred to one person. Under what
 64550	condition is the will of the people delegated to one person? On
 64551	condition that that person expresses the will of the whole people. That
 64552	is, power is power: in other words, power is a word the meaning of which
 64553	we do not understand.
 64554	
 64555	If the realm of human knowledge were confined to abstract reasoning,
 64556	then having subjected to criticism the explanation of âpowerâ that
 64557	juridical science gives us, humanity would conclude that power is merely
 64558	a word and has no real existence. But to understand phenomena man
 64559	has, besides abstract reasoning, experience by which he verifies his
 64560	reflections. And experience tells us that power is not merely a word but
 64561	an actually existing phenomenon.
 64562	
 64563	Not to speak of the fact that no description of the collective activity
 64564	of men can do without the conception of power, the existence of power is
 64565	proved both by history and by observing contemporary events.
 64566	
 64567	Whenever an event occurs a man appears or men appear, by whose will the
 64568	event seems to have taken place. Napoleon III issues a decree and the
 64569	French go to Mexico. The King of Prussia and Bismarck issue decrees and
 64570	an army enters Bohemia. Napoleon I issues a decree and an army enters
 64571	Russia. Alexander I gives a command and the French submit to the
 64572	Bourbons. Experience shows us that whatever event occurs it is always
 64573	related to the will of one or of several men who have decreed it.
 64574	
 64575	The historians, in accord with the old habit of acknowledging divine
 64576	intervention in human affairs, want to see the cause of events in
 64577	the expression of the will of someone endowed with power, but that
 64578	supposition is not confirmed either by reason or by experience.
 64579	
 64580	On the one side reflection shows that the expression of a manâs willâhis
 64581	wordsâare only part of the general activity expressed in an event,
 64582	as for instance in a war or a revolution, and so without assuming an
 64583	incomprehensible, supernatural forceâa miracleâone cannot admit that
 64584	words can be the immediate cause of the movements of millions of men.
 64585	On the other hand, even if we admitted that words could be the cause
 64586	of events, history shows that the expression of the will of historical
 64587	personages does not in most cases produce any effect, that is to say,
 64588	their commands are often not executed, and sometimes the very opposite
 64589	of what they order occurs.
 64590	
 64591	Without admitting divine intervention in the affairs of humanity we
 64592	cannot regard âpowerâ as the cause of events.
 64593	
 64594	Power, from the standpoint of experience, is merely the relation that
 64595	exists between the expression of someoneâs will and the execution of
 64596	that will by others.
 64597	
 64598	To explain the conditions of that relationship we must first establish a
 64599	conception of the expression of will, referring it to man and not to the
 64600	Deity.
 64601	
 64602	If the Deity issues a command, expresses His will, as ancient history
 64603	tells us, the expression of that will is independent of time and is not
 64604	caused by anything, for the Divinity is not controlled by an event. But
 64605	speaking of commands that are the expression of the will of men acting
 64606	in time and in relation to one another, to explain the connection of
 64607	commands with events we must restore: (1) the condition of all that
 64608	takes place: the continuity of movement in time both of the events and
 64609	of the person who commands, and (2) the inevitability of the connection
 64610	between the person commanding and those who execute his command.
 64611	
 64612	
 64613	
 64614	
 64615	
 64616	CHAPTER VI
 64617	
 64618	Only the expression of the will of the Deity, not dependent on time, can
 64619	relate to a whole series of events occurring over a period of years or
 64620	centuries, and only the Deity, independent of everything, can by His
 64621	sole will determine the direction of humanityâs movement; but man acts
 64622	in time and himself takes part in what occurs.
 64623	
 64624	Reinstating the first condition omitted, that of time, we see that no
 64625	command can be executed without some preceding order having been given
 64626	rendering the execution of the last command possible.
 64627	
 64628	No command ever appears spontaneously, or itself covers a whole series
 64629	of occurrences; but each command follows from another, and never refers
 64630	to a whole series of events but always to one moment only of an event.
 64631	
 64632	When, for instance, we say that Napoleon ordered armies to go to war,
 64633	we combine in one simultaneous expression a whole series of consecutive
 64634	commands dependent one on another. Napoleon could not have commanded
 64635	an invasion of Russia and never did so. Today he ordered such and such
 64636	papers to be written to Vienna, to Berlin, and to Petersburg;
 64637	tomorrow such and such decrees and orders to the army, the fleet, the
 64638	commissariat, and so on and so onâmillions of commands, which formed
 64639	a whole series corresponding to a series of events which brought the
 64640	French armies into Russia.
 64641	
 64642	If throughout his reign Napoleon gave commands concerning an invasion
 64643	of England and expended on no other undertaking so much time and effort,
 64644	and yet during his whole reign never once attempted to execute that
 64645	design but undertook an expedition into Russia, with which country he
 64646	considered it desirable to be in alliance (a conviction he repeatedly
 64647	expressed)âthis came about because his commands did not correspond to
 64648	the course of events in the first case, but did so correspond in the
 64649	latter.
 64650	
 64651	For an order to be certainly executed, it is necessary that a man should
 64652	order what can be executed. But to know what can and what cannot be
 64653	executed is impossible, not only in the case of Napoleonâs invasion of
 64654	Russia in which millions participated, but even in the simplest event,
 64655	for in either case millions of obstacles may arise to prevent its
 64656	execution. Every order executed is always one of an immense number
 64657	unexecuted. All the impossible orders inconsistent with the course of
 64658	events remain unexecuted. Only the possible ones get linked up with a
 64659	consecutive series of commands corresponding to a series of events, and
 64660	are executed.
 64661	
 64662	Our false conception that an event is caused by a command which precedes
 64663	it is due to the fact that when the event has taken place and out of
 64664	thousands of others those few commands which were consistent with that
 64665	event have been executed, we forget about the others that were not
 64666	executed because they could not be. Apart from that, the chief source
 64667	of our error in this matter is due to the fact that in the historical
 64668	accounts a whole series of innumerable, diverse, and petty events, such
 64669	for instance as all those which led the French armies to Russia, is
 64670	generalized into one event in accord with the result produced by that
 64671	series of events, and corresponding with this generalization the whole
 64672	series of commands is also generalized into a single expression of will.
 64673	
 64674	We say that Napoleon wished to invade Russia and invaded it. In
 64675	reality in all Napoleonâs activity we never find anything resembling an
 64676	expression of that wish, but find a series of orders, or expressions of
 64677	his will, very variously and indefinitely directed. Amid a long series
 64678	of unexecuted orders of Napoleonâs one series, for the campaign of 1812,
 64679	was carried outânot because those orders differed in any way from the
 64680	other, unexecuted orders but because they coincided with the course of
 64681	events that led the French army into Russia; just as in stencil work
 64682	this or that figure comes out not because the color was laid on from
 64683	this side or in that way, but because it was laid on from all sides over
 64684	the figure cut in the stencil.
 64685	
 64686	So that examining the relation in time of the commands to the events,
 64687	we find that a command can never be the cause of the event, but that a
 64688	certain definite dependence exists between the two.
 64689	
 64690	To understand in what this dependence consists it is necessary to
 64691	reinstate another omitted condition of every command proceeding not from
 64692	the Deity but from a man, which is, that the man who gives the command
 64693	himself takes part in the event.
 64694	
 64695	This relation of the commander to those he commands is just what is
 64696	called power. This relation consists in the following:
 64697	
 64698	For common action people always unite in certain combinations, in which
 64699	regardless of the difference of the aims set for the common action, the
 64700	relation between those taking part in it is always the same.
 64701	
 64702	Men uniting in these combinations always assume such relations toward
 64703	one another that the larger number take a more direct share, and the
 64704	smaller number a less direct share, in the collective action for which
 64705	they have combined.
 64706	
 64707	Of all the combinations in which men unite for collective action one of
 64708	the most striking and definite examples is an army.
 64709	
 64710	Every army is composed of lower grades of the serviceâthe rank and
 64711	fileâof whom there are always the greatest number; of the next higher
 64712	military rankâcorporals and noncommissioned officers of whom there are
 64713	fewer, and of still-higher officers of whom there are still fewer,
 64714	and so on to the highest military command which is concentrated in one
 64715	person.
 64716	
 64717	A military organization may be quite correctly compared to a cone, of
 64718	which the base with the largest diameter consists of the rank and file;
 64719	the next higher and smaller section of the cone consists of the next
 64720	higher grades of the army, and so on to the apex, the point of which
 64721	will represent the commander in chief.
 64722	
 64723	The soldiers, of whom there are the most, form the lower section of
 64724	the cone and its base. The soldier himself does the stabbing, hacking,
 64725	burning, and pillaging, and always receives orders for these actions
 64726	from men above him; he himself never gives an order. The noncommissioned
 64727	officers (of whom there are fewer) perform the action itself less
 64728	frequently than the soldiers, but they already give commands. An
 64729	officer still less often acts directly himself, but commands still more
 64730	frequently. A general does nothing but command the troops, indicates the
 64731	objective, and hardly ever uses a weapon himself. The commander in chief
 64732	never takes direct part in the action itself, but only gives general
 64733	orders concerning the movement of the mass of the troops. A similar
 64734	relation of people to one another is seen in every combination of men
 64735	for common activityâin agriculture, trade, and every administration.
 64736	
 64737	And so without particularly analyzing all the contiguous sections of
 64738	a cone and of the ranks of an army, or the ranks and positions in
 64739	any administrative or public business whatever from the lowest to the
 64740	highest, we see a law by which men, to take associated action, combine
 64741	in such relations that the more directly they participate in performing
 64742	the action the less they can command and the more numerous they are,
 64743	while the less their direct participation in the action itself, the more
 64744	they command and the fewer of them there are; rising in this way from
 64745	the lowest ranks to the man at the top, who takes the least direct share
 64746	in the action and directs his activity chiefly to commanding.
 64747	
 64748	This relation of the men who command to those they command is what
 64749	constitutes the essence of the conception called power.
 64750	
 64751	Having restored the condition of time under which all events occur,
 64752	we find that a command is executed only when it is related to a
 64753	corresponding series of events. Restoring the essential condition of
 64754	relation between those who command and those who execute, we find that
 64755	by the very nature of the case those who command take the smallest part
 64756	in the action itself and that their activity is exclusively directed to
 64757	commanding.
 64758	
 64759	
 64760	
 64761	
 64762	
 64763	CHAPTER VII
 64764	
 64765	When an event is taking place people express their opinions and wishes
 64766	about it, and as the event results from the collective activity of
 64767	many people, some one of the opinions or wishes expressed is sure to be
 64768	fulfilled if but approximately. When one of the opinions expressed
 64769	is fulfilled, that opinion gets connected with the event as a command
 64770	preceding it.
 64771	
 64772	Men are hauling a log. Each of them expresses his opinion as to how and
 64773	where to haul it. They haul the log away, and it happens that this is
 64774	done as one of them said. He ordered it. There we have command and power
 64775	in their primary form. The man who worked most with his hands could not
 64776	think so much about what he was doing, or reflect on or command what
 64777	would result from the common activity; while the man who commanded
 64778	more would evidently work less with his hands on account of his greater
 64779	verbal activity.
 64780	
 64781	When some larger concourse of men direct their activity to a common aim
 64782	there is a yet sharper division of those who, because their activity is
 64783	given to directing and commanding, take less part in the direct work.
 64784	
 64785	When a man works alone he always has a certain set of reflections which
 64786	as it seems to him directed his past activity, justify his present
 64787	activity, and guide him in planning his future actions. Just the same is
 64788	done by a concourse of people, allowing those who do not take a direct
 64789	part in the activity to devise considerations, justifications, and
 64790	surmises concerning their collective activity.
 64791	
 64792	For reasons known or unknown to us the French began to drown and kill
 64793	one another. And corresponding to the event its justification appears in
 64794	peopleâs belief that this was necessary for the welfare of France, for
 64795	liberty, and for equality. People ceased to kill one another, and
 64796	this event was accompanied by its justification in the necessity for a
 64797	centralization of power, resistance to Europe, and so on. Men went
 64798	from the west to the east killing their fellow men, and the event
 64799	was accompanied by phrases about the glory of France, the baseness of
 64800	England, and so on. History shows us that these justifications of the
 64801	events have no common sense and are all contradictory, as in the case of
 64802	killing a man as the result of recognizing his rights, and the killing
 64803	of millions in Russia for the humiliation of England. But these
 64804	justifications have a very necessary significance in their own day.
 64805	
 64806	These justifications release those who produce the events from moral
 64807	responsibility. These temporary aims are like the broom fixed in front
 64808	of a locomotive to clear the snow from the rails in front: they clear
 64809	menâs moral responsibilities from their path.
 64810	
 64811	Without such justification there would be no reply to the simplest
 64812	question that presents itself when examining each historical event. How
 64813	is it that millions of men commit collective crimesâmake war, commit
 64814	murder, and so on?
 64815	
 64816	With the present complex forms of political and social life in Europe
 64817	can any event that is not prescribed, decreed, or ordered by monarchs,
 64818	ministers, parliaments, or newspapers be imagined? Is there any
 64819	collective action which cannot find its justification in political
 64820	unity, in patriotism, in the balance of power, or in civilization? So
 64821	that every event that occurs inevitably coincides with some expressed
 64822	wish and, receiving a justification, presents itself as the result of
 64823	the will of one man or of several men.
 64824	
 64825	In whatever direction a ship moves, the flow of the waves it cuts
 64826	will always be noticeable ahead of it. To those on board the ship the
 64827	movement of those waves will be the only perceptible motion.
 64828	
 64829	Only by watching closely moment by moment the movement of that flow and
 64830	comparing it with the movement of the ship do we convince ourselves that
 64831	every bit of it is occasioned by the forward movement of the ship,
 64832	and that we were led into error by the fact that we ourselves were
 64833	imperceptibly moving.
 64834	
 64835	We see the same if we watch moment by moment the movement of historical
 64836	characters (that is, re-establish the inevitable condition of all that
 64837	occursâthe continuity of movement in time) and do not lose sight of the
 64838	essential connection of historical persons with the masses.
 64839	
 64840	When the ship moves in one direction there is one and the same wave
 64841	ahead of it, when it turns frequently the wave ahead of it also turns
 64842	frequently. But wherever it may turn there always will be the wave
 64843	anticipating its movement.
 64844	
 64845	Whatever happens it always appears that just that event was foreseen
 64846	and decreed. Wherever the ship may go, the rush of water which neither
 64847	directs nor increases its movement foams ahead of it, and at a distance
 64848	seems to us not merely to move of itself but to govern the shipâs
 64849	movement also.
 64850	
 64851	Examining only those expressions of the will of historical persons
 64852	which, as commands, were related to events, historians have assumed
 64853	that the events depended on those commands. But examining the events
 64854	themselves and the connection in which the historical persons stood to
 64855	the people, we have found that they and their orders were dependent on
 64856	events. The incontestable proof of this deduction is that, however many
 64857	commands were issued, the event does not take place unless there are
 64858	other causes for it, but as soon as an event occursâbe it what it
 64859	mayâthen out of all the continually expressed wishes of different people
 64860	some will always be found which by their meaning and their time of
 64861	utterance are related as commands to the events.
 64862	
 64863	Arriving at this conclusion we can reply directly and positively to
 64864	these two essential questions of history:
 64865	
 64866	(1) What is power?
 64867	
 64868	(2) What force produces the movement of the nations?
 64869	
 64870	(1) Power is the relation of a given person to other individuals,
 64871	in which the more this person expresses opinions, predictions, and
 64872	justifications of the collective action that is performed, the less is
 64873	his participation in that action.
 64874	
 64875	(2) The movement of nations is caused not by power, nor by intellectual
 64876	activity, nor even by a combination of the two as historians have
 64877	supposed, but by the activity of all the people who participate in
 64878	the events, and who always combine in such a way that those taking
 64879	the largest direct share in the event take on themselves the least
 64880	responsibility and vice versa.
 64881	
 64882	Morally the wielder of power appears to cause the event; physically
 64883	it is those who submit to the power. But as the moral activity is
 64884	inconceivable without the physical, the cause of the event is neither in
 64885	the one nor in the other but in the union of the two.
 64886	
 64887	Or in other words, the conception of a cause is inapplicable to the
 64888	phenomena we are examining.
 64889	
 64890	In the last analysis we reach the circle of infinityâthat final limit
 64891	to which in every domain of thought manâs reason arrives if it is not
 64892	playing with the subject. Electricity produces heat, heat produces
 64893	electricity. Atoms attract each other and atoms repel one another.
 64894	
 64895	Speaking of the interaction of heat and electricity and of atoms, we
 64896	cannot say why this occurs, and we say that it is so because it is
 64897	inconceivable otherwise, because it must be so and that it is a law. The
 64898	same applies to historical events. Why war and revolution occur we do
 64899	not know. We only know that to produce the one or the other action,
 64900	people combine in a certain formation in which they all take part, and
 64901	we say that this is so because it is unthinkable otherwise, or in other
 64902	words that it is a law.
 64903	
 64904	
 64905	
 64906	
 64907	
 64908	CHAPTER VIII
 64909	
 64910	If history dealt only with external phenomena, the establishment of this
 64911	simple and obvious law would suffice and we should have finished our
 64912	argument. But the law of history relates to man. A particle of matter
 64913	cannot tell us that it does not feel the law of attraction or repulsion
 64914	and that that law is untrue, but man, who is the subject of history,
 64915	says plainly: I am free and am therefore not subject to the law.
 64916	
 64917	The presence of the problem of manâs free will, though unexpressed, is
 64918	felt at every step of history.
 64919	
 64920	All seriously thinking historians have involuntarily encountered this
 64921	question. All the contradictions and obscurities of history and the
 64922	false path historical science has followed are due solely to the lack of
 64923	a solution of that question.
 64924	
 64925	If the will of every man were free, that is, if each man could act as he
 64926	pleased, all history would be a series of disconnected incidents.
 64927	
 64928	If in a thousand years even one man in a million could act freely, that
 64929	is, as he chose, it is evident that one single free act of that manâs
 64930	in violation of the laws governing human action would destroy the
 64931	possibility of the existence of any laws for the whole of humanity.
 64932	
 64933	If there be a single law governing the actions of men, free will cannot
 64934	exist, for then manâs will is subject to that law.
 64935	
 64936	In this contradiction lies the problem of free will, which from most
 64937	ancient times has occupied the best human minds and from most ancient
 64938	times has been presented in its whole tremendous significance.
 64939	
 64940	The problem is that regarding man as a subject of observation
 64941	from whatever point of viewâtheological, historical, ethical, or
 64942	philosophicâwe find a general law of necessity to which he (like all
 64943	that exists) is subject. But regarding him from within ourselves as what
 64944	we are conscious of, we feel ourselves to be free.
 64945	
 64946	This consciousness is a source of self-cognition quite apart from and
 64947	independent of reason. Through his reason man observes himself, but only
 64948	through consciousness does he know himself.
 64949	
 64950	Apart from consciousness of self no observation or application of reason
 64951	is conceivable.
 64952	
 64953	To understand, observe, and draw conclusions, man must first of all be
 64954	conscious of himself as living. A man is only conscious of himself as
 64955	a living being by the fact that he wills, that is, is conscious of
 64956	his volition. But his willâwhich forms the essence of his lifeâman
 64957	recognizes (and can but recognize) as free.
 64958	
 64959	If, observing himself, man sees that his will is always directed by
 64960	one and the same law (whether he observes the necessity of taking
 64961	food, using his brain, or anything else) he cannot recognize this
 64962	never-varying direction of his will otherwise than as a limitation of
 64963	it. Were it not free it could not be limited. A manâs will seems to him
 64964	to be limited just because he is not conscious of it except as free.
 64965	
 64966	You say: I am not free. But I have lifted my hand and let it fall.
 64967	Everyone understands that this illogical reply is an irrefutable
 64968	demonstration of freedom.
 64969	
 64970	That reply is the expression of a consciousness that is not subject to
 64971	reason.
 64972	
 64973	If the consciousness of freedom were not a separate and independent
 64974	source of self-consciousness it would be subject to reasoning and
 64975	to experience, but in fact such subjection does not exist and is
 64976	inconceivable.
 64977	
 64978	A series of experiments and arguments proves to every man that he, as
 64979	an object of observation, is subject to certain laws, and man submits to
 64980	them and never resists the laws of gravity or impermeability once he
 64981	has become acquainted with them. But the same series of experiments
 64982	and arguments proves to him that the complete freedom of which he is
 64983	conscious in himself is impossible, and that his every action depends
 64984	on his organization, his character, and the motives acting upon him; yet
 64985	man never submits to the deductions of these experiments and arguments.
 64986	Having learned from experiment and argument that a stone falls
 64987	downwards, a man indubitably believes this and always expects the law
 64988	that he has learned to be fulfilled.
 64989	
 64990	But learning just as certainly that his will is subject to laws, he does
 64991	not and cannot believe this.
 64992	
 64993	However often experiment and reasoning may show a man that under the
 64994	same conditions and with the same character he will do the same thing as
 64995	before, yet when under the same conditions and with the same character
 64996	he approaches for the thousandth time the action that always ends in the
 64997	same way, he feels as certainly convinced as before the experiment
 64998	that he can act as he pleases. Every man, savage or sage, however
 64999	incontestably reason and experiment may prove to him that it is
 65000	impossible to imagine two different courses of action in precisely the
 65001	same conditions, feels that without this irrational conception (which
 65002	constitutes the essence of freedom) he cannot imagine life. He feels
 65003	that however impossible it may be, it is so, for without this conception
 65004	of freedom not only would he be unable to understand life, but he would
 65005	be unable to live for a single moment.
 65006	
 65007	He could not live, because all manâs efforts, all his impulses to life,
 65008	are only efforts to increase freedom. Wealth and poverty, fame and
 65009	obscurity, power and subordination, strength and weakness, health and
 65010	disease, culture and ignorance, work and leisure, repletion and hunger,
 65011	virtue and vice, are only greater or lesser degrees of freedom.
 65012	
 65013	A man having no freedom cannot be conceived of except as deprived of
 65014	life.
 65015	
 65016	If the conception of freedom appears to reason to be a senseless
 65017	contradiction like the possibility of performing two actions at one and
 65018	the same instant of time, or of an effect without a cause, that only
 65019	proves that consciousness is not subject to reason.
 65020	
 65021	This unshakable, irrefutable consciousness of freedom, uncontrolled by
 65022	experiment or argument, recognized by all thinkers and felt by everyone
 65023	without exception, this consciousness without which no conception of man
 65024	is possible constitutes the other side of the question.
 65025	
 65026	Man is the creation of an all-powerful, all-good, and all-seeing God.
 65027	What is sin, the conception of which arises from the consciousness of
 65028	manâs freedom? That is a question for theology.
 65029	
 65030	The actions of men are subject to general immutable laws expressed in
 65031	statistics. What is manâs responsibility to society, the conception of
 65032	which results from the conception of freedom? That is a question for
 65033	jurisprudence.
 65034	
 65035	Manâs actions proceed from his innate character and the motives acting
 65036	upon him. What is conscience and the perception of right and wrong
 65037	in actions that follows from the consciousness of freedom? That is a
 65038	question for ethics.
 65039	
 65040	Man in connection with the general life of humanity appears subject
 65041	to laws which determine that life. But the same man apart from that
 65042	connection appears to be free. How should the past life of nations and
 65043	of humanity be regardedâas the result of the free, or as the result of
 65044	the constrained, activity of man? That is a question for history.
 65045	
 65046	Only in our self-confident day of the popularization of knowledgeâthanks
 65047	to that most powerful engine of ignorance, the diffusion of printed
 65048	matterâhas the question of the freedom of will been put on a level on
 65049	which the question itself cannot exist. In our time the majority of
 65050	so-called advanced peopleâthat is, the crowd of ignoramusesâhave taken
 65051	the work of the naturalists who deal with one side of the question for a
 65052	solution of the whole problem.
 65053	
 65054	They say and write and print that the soul and freedom do not exist,
 65055	for the life of man is expressed by muscular movements and muscular
 65056	movements are conditioned by the activity of the nerves; the soul and
 65057	free will do not exist because at an unknown period of time we sprang
 65058	from the apes. They say this, not at all suspecting that thousands of
 65059	years ago that same law of necessity which with such ardor they are now
 65060	trying to prove by physiology and comparative zoology was not merely
 65061	acknowledged by all the religions and all the thinkers, but has never
 65062	been denied. They do not see that the role of the natural sciences in
 65063	this matter is merely to serve as an instrument for the illumination
 65064	of one side of it. For the fact that, from the point of view of
 65065	observation, reason and the will are merely secretions of the brain, and
 65066	that man following the general law may have developed from lower animals
 65067	at some unknown period of time, only explains from a fresh side
 65068	the truth admitted thousands of years ago by all the religious and
 65069	philosophic theoriesâthat from the point of view of reason man is
 65070	subject to the law of necessity; but it does not advance by a hairâs
 65071	breadth the solution of the question, which has another, opposite, side,
 65072	based on the consciousness of freedom.
 65073	
 65074	If men descended from the apes at an unknown period of time, that is
 65075	as comprehensible as that they were made from a handful of earth at a
 65076	certain period of time (in the first case the unknown quantity is the
 65077	time, in the second case it is the origin); and the question of how
 65078	manâs consciousness of freedom is to be reconciled with the law of
 65079	necessity to which he is subject cannot be solved by comparative
 65080	physiology and zoology, for in a frog, a rabbit, or an ape, we can
 65081	observe only the muscular nervous activity, but in man we observe
 65082	consciousness as well as the muscular and nervous activity.
 65083	
 65084	The naturalists and their followers, thinking they can solve this
 65085	question, are like plasterers set to plaster one side of the walls of
 65086	a church who, availing themselves of the absence of the chief
 65087	superintendent of the work, should in an access of zeal plaster over the
 65088	windows, icons, woodwork, and still unbuttressed walls, and should be
 65089	delighted that from their point of view as plasterers, everything is now
 65090	so smooth and regular.

 65096	CHAPTER IX
 65097	
 65098	For the solution of the question of free will or inevitability, history
 65099	has this advantage over other branches of knowledge in which the
 65100	question is dealt with, that for history this question does not refer
 65101	to the essence of manâs free will but its manifestation in the past and
 65102	under certain conditions.
 65103	
 65104	In regard to this question, history stands to the other sciences as
 65105	experimental science stands to abstract science.
 65106	
 65107	The subject for history is not manâs will itself but our presentation of
 65108	it.
 65109	
 65110	And so for history, the insoluble mystery presented by the
 65111	incompatibility of free will and inevitability does not exist as it does
 65112	for theology, ethics, and philosophy. History surveys a presentation of
 65113	manâs life in which the union of these two contradictions has already
 65114	taken place.
 65115	
 65116	In actual life each historic event, each human action, is very clearly
 65117	and definitely understood without any sense of contradiction, although
 65118	each event presents itself as partly free and partly compulsory.
 65119	
 65120	To solve the question of how freedom and necessity are combined and
 65121	what constitutes the essence of these two conceptions, the philosophy
 65122	of history can and should follow a path contrary to that taken by other
 65123	sciences. Instead of first defining the conceptions of freedom and
 65124	inevitability in themselves, and then ranging the phenomena of life
 65125	under those definitions, history should deduce a definition of the
 65126	conception of freedom and inevitability themselves from the immense
 65127	quantity of phenomena of which it is cognizant and that always appear
 65128	dependent on these two elements.
 65129	
 65130	Whatever presentation of the activity of many men or of an individual
 65131	we may consider, we always regard it as the result partly of manâs free
 65132	will and partly of the law of inevitability.
 65133	
 65134	Whether we speak of the migration of the peoples and the incursions
 65135	of the barbarians, or of the decrees of Napoleon III, or of someoneâs
 65136	action an hour ago in choosing one direction out of several for his
 65137	walk, we are unconscious of any contradiction. The degree of freedom and
 65138	inevitability governing the actions of these people is clearly defined
 65139	for us.
 65140	
 65141	Our conception of the degree of freedom often varies according to
 65142	differences in the point of view from which we regard the event, but
 65143	every human action appears to us as a certain combination of freedom and
 65144	inevitability. In every action we examine we see a certain measure of
 65145	freedom and a certain measure of inevitability. And always the more
 65146	freedom we see in any action the less inevitability do we perceive, and
 65147	the more inevitability the less freedom.
 65148	
 65149	The proportion of freedom to inevitability decreases and increases
 65150	according to the point of view from which the action is regarded, but
 65151	their relation is always one of inverse proportion.
 65152	
 65153	A sinking man who clutches at another and drowns him; or a hungry mother
 65154	exhausted by feeding her baby, who steals some food; or a man trained
 65155	to discipline who on duty at the word of command kills a defenseless
 65156	manâseem less guilty, that is, less free and more subject to the law of
 65157	necessity, to one who knows the circumstances in which these people were
 65158	placed, and more free to one who does not know that the man was himself
 65159	drowning, that the mother was hungry, that the soldier was in the ranks,
 65160	and so on. Similarly a man who committed a murder twenty years ago and
 65161	has since lived peaceably and harmlessly in society seems less guilty
 65162	and his action more due to the law of inevitability, to someone who
 65163	considers his action after twenty years have elapsed than to one who
 65164	examined it the day after it was committed. And in the same way every
 65165	action of an insane, intoxicated, or highly excited man appears less
 65166	free and more inevitable to one who knows the mental condition of him
 65167	who committed the action, and seems more free and less inevitable to one
 65168	who does not know it. In all these cases the conception of freedom
 65169	is increased or diminished and the conception of compulsion is
 65170	correspondingly decreased or increased, according to the point of view
 65171	from which the action is regarded. So that the greater the conception of
 65172	necessity the smaller the conception of freedom and vice versa.
 65173	
 65174	Religion, the common sense of mankind, the science of jurisprudence,
 65175	and history itself understand alike this relation between necessity and
 65176	freedom.
 65177	
 65178	All cases without exception in which our conception of freedom and
 65179	necessity is increased and diminished depend on three considerations:
 65180	
 65181	(1) The relation to the external world of the man who commits the deeds.
 65182	
 65183	(2) His relation to time.
 65184	
 65185	(3) His relation to the causes leading to the action.
 65186	
 65187	The first consideration is the clearness of our perception of the manâs
 65188	relation to the external world and the greater or lesser clearness
 65189	of our understanding of the definite position occupied by the man
 65190	in relation to everything coexisting with him. This is what makes it
 65191	evident that a drowning man is less free and more subject to necessity
 65192	than one standing on dry ground, and that makes the actions of a man
 65193	closely connected with others in a thickly populated district, or of one
 65194	bound by family, official, or business duties, seem certainly less free
 65195	and more subject to necessity than those of a man living in solitude and
 65196	seclusion.
 65197	
 65198	If we consider a man alone, apart from his relation to everything around
 65199	him, each action of his seems to us free. But if we see his relation
 65200	to anything around him, if we see his connection with anything
 65201	whateverâwith a man who speaks to him, a book he reads, the work on
 65202	which he is engaged, even with the air he breathes or the light that
 65203	falls on the things about himâwe see that each of these circumstances
 65204	has an influence on him and controls at least some side of his activity.
 65205	And the more we perceive of these influences the more our conception of
 65206	his freedom diminishes and the more our conception of the necessity that
 65207	weighs on him increases.
 65208	
 65209	The second consideration is the more or less evident time relation of
 65210	the man to the world and the clearness of our perception of the place
 65211	the manâs action occupies in time. That is the ground which makes the
 65212	fall of the first man, resulting in the production of the human race,
 65213	appear evidently less free than a manâs entry into marriage today. It is
 65214	the reason why the life and activity of people who lived centuries ago
 65215	and are connected with me in time cannot seem to me as free as the life
 65216	of a contemporary, the consequences of which are still unknown to me.
 65217	
 65218	The degree of our conception of freedom or inevitability depends in this
 65219	respect on the greater or lesser lapse of time between the performance
 65220	of the action and our judgment of it.
 65221	
 65222	If I examine an act I performed a moment ago in approximately the same
 65223	circumstances as those I am in now, my action appears to me undoubtedly
 65224	free. But if I examine an act performed a month ago, then being in
 65225	different circumstances, I cannot help recognizing that if that act had
 65226	not been committed much that resulted from itâgood, agreeable, and even
 65227	essentialâwould not have taken place. If I reflect on an action still
 65228	more remote, ten years ago or more, then the consequences of my action
 65229	are still plainer to me and I find it hard to imagine what would have
 65230	happened had that action not been performed. The farther I go back
 65231	in memory, or what is the same thing the farther I go forward in my
 65232	judgment, the more doubtful becomes my belief in the freedom of my
 65233	action.
 65234	
 65235	In history we find a very similar progress of conviction concerning
 65236	the part played by free will in the general affairs of humanity. A
 65237	contemporary event seems to us to be indubitably the doing of all the
 65238	known participants, but with a more remote event we already see its
 65239	inevitable results which prevent our considering anything else possible.
 65240	And the farther we go back in examining events the less arbitrary do
 65241	they appear.
 65242	
 65243	The Austro-Prussian war appears to us undoubtedly the result of the
 65244	crafty conduct of Bismarck, and so on. The Napoleonic wars still seem
 65245	to us, though already questionably, to be the outcome of their heroesâ
 65246	will. But in the Crusades we already see an event occupying its definite
 65247	place in history and without which we cannot imagine the modern history
 65248	of Europe, though to the chroniclers of the Crusades that event appeared
 65249	as merely due to the will of certain people. In regard to the migration
 65250	of the peoples it does not enter anyoneâs head today to suppose that
 65251	the renovation of the European world depended on Attilaâs caprice. The
 65252	farther back in history the object of our observation lies, the more
 65253	doubtful does the free will of those concerned in the event become and
 65254	the more manifest the law of inevitability.
 65255	
 65256	The third consideration is the degree to which we apprehend that
 65257	endless chain of causation inevitably demanded by reason, in which each
 65258	phenomenon comprehended, and therefore manâs every action, must have
 65259	its definite place as a result of what has gone before and as a cause of
 65260	what will follow.
 65261	
 65262	The better we are acquainted with the physiological, psychological, and
 65263	historical laws deduced by observation and by which man is controlled,
 65264	and the more correctly we perceive the physiological, psychological,
 65265	and historical causes of the action, and the simpler the action we are
 65266	observing and the less complex the character and mind of the man in
 65267	question, the more subject to inevitability and the less free do our
 65268	actions and those of others appear.
 65269	
 65270	When we do not at all understand the cause of an action, whether a
 65271	crime, a good action, or even one that is simply nonmoral, we ascribe a
 65272	greater amount of freedom to it. In the case of a crime we most urgently
 65273	demand the punishment for such an act; in the case of a virtuous act we
 65274	rate its merit most highly. In an indifferent case we recognize in it
 65275	more individuality, originality, and independence. But if even one of
 65276	the innumerable causes of the act is known to us we recognize a certain
 65277	element of necessity and are less insistent on punishment for the crime,
 65278	or the acknowledgment of the merit of the virtuous act, or the freedom
 65279	of the apparently original action. That a criminal was reared among
 65280	malefactors mitigates his fault in our eyes. The self-sacrifice of a father
 65281	or mother, or self-sacrifice with the possibility of a reward, is more
 65282	comprehensible than gratuitous self-sacrifice, and therefore seems less
 65283	deserving of sympathy and less the result of free will. The founder of a
 65284	sect or party, or an inventor, impresses us less when we know how or by
 65285	what the way was prepared for his activity. If we have a large range
 65286	of examples, if our observation is constantly directed to seeking the
 65287	correlation of cause and effect in peopleâs actions, their actions
 65288	appear to us more under compulsion and less free the more correctly we
 65289	connect the effects with the causes. If we examined simple actions and
 65290	had a vast number of such actions under observation, our conception of
 65291	their inevitability would be still greater. The dishonest conduct of the
 65292	son of a dishonest father, the misconduct of a woman who had fallen
 65293	into bad company, a drunkardâs relapse into drunkenness, and so on are
 65294	actions that seem to us less free the better we understand their cause.
 65295	If the man whose actions we are considering is on a very low stage of
 65296	mental development, like a child, a madman, or a simpletonâthen,
 65297	knowing the causes of the act and the simplicity of the character and
 65298	intelligence in question, we see so large an element of necessity and so
 65299	little free will that as soon as we know the cause prompting the action
 65300	we can foretell the result.
 65301	
 65302	On these three considerations alone is based the conception of
 65303	irresponsibility for crimes and the extenuating circumstances admitted
 65304	by all legislative codes. The responsibility appears greater or less
 65305	according to our greater or lesser knowledge of the circumstances in
 65306	which the man was placed whose action is being judged, and according
 65307	to the greater or lesser interval of time between the commission of the
 65308	action and its investigation, and according to the greater or lesser
 65309	understanding of the causes that led to the action.
 65310	
 65311	
 65312	
 65313	
 65314	
 65315	CHAPTER X
 65316	
 65317	Thus our conception of free will and inevitability gradually diminishes
 65318	or increases according to the greater or lesser connection with the
 65319	external world, the greater or lesser remoteness of time, and the
 65320	greater or lesser dependence on the causes in relation to which we
 65321	contemplate a manâs life.
 65322	
 65323	So that if we examine the case of a man whose connection with the
 65324	external world is well known, where the time between the action and
 65325	its examination is great, and where the causes of the action are most
 65326	accessible, we get the conception of a maximum of inevitability and a
 65327	minimum of free will. If we examine a man little dependent on external
 65328	conditions, whose action was performed very recently, and the causes of
 65329	whose action are beyond our ken, we get the conception of a minimum of
 65330	inevitability and a maximum of freedom.
 65331	
 65332	In neither caseâhowever we may change our point of view, however plain
 65333	we may make to ourselves the connection between the man and the external
 65334	world, however inaccessible it may be to us, however long or short the
 65335	period of time, however intelligible or incomprehensible the causes
 65336	of the action may beâcan we ever conceive either complete freedom or
 65337	complete necessity.
 65338	
 65339	(1) To whatever degree we may imagine a man to be exempt from the
 65340	influence of the external world, we never get a conception of freedom
 65341	in space. Every human action is inevitably conditioned by what surrounds
 65342	him and by his own body. I lift my arm and let it fall. My action seems
 65343	to me free; but asking myself whether I could raise my arm in every
 65344	direction, I see that I raised it in the direction in which there was
 65345	least obstruction to that action either from things around me or from
 65346	the construction of my own body. I chose one out of all the possible
 65347	directions because in it there were fewest obstacles. For my action
 65348	to be free it was necessary that it should encounter no obstacles. To
 65349	conceive of a man being free we must imagine him outside space, which is
 65350	evidently impossible.
 65351	
 65352	(2) However much we approximate the time of judgment to the time of the
 65353	deed, we never get a conception of freedom in time. For if I examine
 65354	an action committed a second ago I must still recognize it as not
 65355	being free, for it is irrevocably linked to the moment at which it was
 65356	committed. Can I lift my arm? I lift it, but ask myself: could I have
 65357	abstained from lifting my arm at the moment that has already passed? To
 65358	convince myself of this I do not lift it the next moment. But I am
 65359	not now abstaining from doing so at the first moment when I asked the
 65360	question. Time has gone by which I could not detain, the arm I then
 65361	lifted is no longer the same as the arm I now refrain from lifting,
 65362	nor is the air in which I lifted it the same that now surrounds me. The
 65363	moment in which the first movement was made is irrevocable, and at that
 65364	moment I could make only one movement, and whatever movement I made
 65365	would be the only one. That I did not lift my arm a moment later does
 65366	not prove that I could have abstained from lifting it then. And since I
 65367	could make only one movement at that single moment of time, it could not
 65368	have been any other. To imagine it as free, it is necessary to imagine
 65369	it in the present, on the boundary between the past and the futureâthat
 65370	is, outside time, which is impossible.
 65371	
 65372	(3) However much the difficulty of understanding the causes may be
 65373	increased, we never reach a conception of complete freedom, that is,
 65374	an absence of cause. However inaccessible to us may be the cause of the
 65375	expression of will in any action, our own or anotherâs, the first demand
 65376	of reason is the assumption of and search for a cause, for without a
 65377	cause no phenomenon is conceivable. I raise my arm to perform an action
 65378	independently of any cause, but my wish to perform an action without a
 65379	cause is the cause of my action.
 65380	
 65381	But even ifâimagining a man quite exempt from all influences, examining
 65382	only his momentary action in the present, unevoked by any causeâwe were
 65383	to admit so infinitely small a remainder of inevitability as equaled
 65384	zero, we should even then not have arrived at the conception of complete
 65385	freedom in man, for a being uninfluenced by the external world, standing
 65386	outside of time and independent of cause, is no longer a man.
 65387	
 65388	In the same way we can never imagine the action of a man quite devoid of
 65389	freedom and entirely subject to the law of inevitability.
 65390	
 65391	(1) However we may increase our knowledge of the conditions of space
 65392	in which man is situated, that knowledge can never be complete, for the
 65393	number of those conditions is as infinite as the infinity of space. And
 65394	therefore so long as not all the conditions influencing men are defined,
 65395	there is no complete inevitability but a certain measure of freedom
 65396	remains.
 65397	
 65398	(2) However we may prolong the period of time between the action we are
 65399	examining and the judgment upon it, that period will be finite, while
 65400	time is infinite, and so in this respect too there can never be absolute
 65401	inevitability.
 65402	
 65403	(3) However accessible may be the chain of causation of any action, we
 65404	shall never know the whole chain since it is endless, and so again we
 65405	never reach absolute inevitability.
 65406	
 65407	But besides this, even if, admitting the remaining minimum of freedom to
 65408	equal zero, we assumed in some given caseâas for instance in that of a
 65409	dying man, an unborn babe, or an idiotâcomplete absence of freedom, by
 65410	so doing we should destroy the very conception of man in the case we are
 65411	examining, for as soon as there is no freedom there is also no man. And
 65412	so the conception of the action of a man subject solely to the law of
 65413	inevitability without any element of freedom is just as impossible as
 65414	the conception of a manâs completely free action.
 65415	
 65416	And so to imagine the action of a man entirely subject to the law of
 65417	inevitability without any freedom, we must assume the knowledge of an
 65418	infinite number of space relations, an infinitely long period of time,
 65419	and an infinite series of causes.
 65420	
 65421	To imagine a man perfectly free and not subject to the law of
 65422	inevitability, we must imagine him all alone, beyond space, beyond time,
 65423	and free from dependence on cause.
 65424	
 65425	In the first case, if inevitability were possible without freedom
 65426	we should have reached a definition of inevitability by the laws of
 65427	inevitability itself, that is, a mere form without content.
 65428	
 65429	In the second case, if freedom were possible without inevitability we
 65430	should have arrived at unconditioned freedom beyond space, time, and
 65431	cause, which by the fact of its being unconditioned and unlimited would
 65432	be nothing, or mere content without form.
 65433	
 65434	We should in fact have reached those two fundamentals of which manâs
 65435	whole outlook on the universe is constructedâthe incomprehensible
 65436	essence of life, and the laws defining that essence.
 65437	
 65438	Reason says: (1) space with all the forms of matter that give it
 65439	visibility is infinite, and cannot be imagined otherwise. (2) Time is
 65440	infinite motion without a moment of rest and is unthinkable otherwise.
 65441	(3) The connection between cause and effect has no beginning and can
 65442	have no end.
 65443	
 65444	Consciousness says: (1) I alone am, and all that exists is but me,
 65445	consequently I include space. (2) I measure flowing time by the fixed
 65446	moment of the present in which alone I am conscious of myself as living,
 65447	consequently I am outside time. (3) I am beyond cause, for I feel myself
 65448	to be the cause of every manifestation of my life.
 65449	
 65450	Reason gives expression to the laws of inevitability. Consciousness
 65451	gives expression to the essence of freedom.
 65452	
 65453	Freedom not limited by anything is the essence of life, in manâs
 65454	consciousness. Inevitability without content is manâs reason in its
 65455	three forms.
 65456	
 65457	Freedom is the thing examined. Inevitability is what examines. Freedom
 65458	is the content. Inevitability is the form.
 65459	
 65460	Only by separating the two sources of cognition, related to one another
 65461	as form to content, do we get the mutually exclusive and separately
 65462	incomprehensible conceptions of freedom and inevitability.
 65463	
 65464	Only by uniting them do we get a clear conception of manâs life.
 65465	
 65466	Apart from these two concepts which in their union mutually define one
 65467	another as form and content, no conception of life is possible.
 65468	
 65469	All that we know of the life of man is merely a certain relation of free
 65470	will to inevitability, that is, of consciousness to the laws of reason.
 65471	
 65472	All that we know of the external world of nature is only a certain
 65473	relation of the forces of nature to inevitability, or of the essence of
 65474	life to the laws of reason.
 65475	
 65476	The great natural forces lie outside us and we are not conscious of
 65477	them; we call those forces gravitation, inertia, electricity, animal
 65478	force, and so on, but we are conscious of the force of life in man and
 65479	we call that freedom.
 65480	
 65481	But just as the force of gravitation, incomprehensible in itself but
 65482	felt by every man, is understood by us only to the extent to which we
 65483	know the laws of inevitability to which it is subject (from the first
 65484	knowledge that all bodies have weight, up to Newtonâs law), so too the
 65485	force of free will, incomprehensible in itself but of which everyone is
 65486	conscious, is intelligible to us only in as far as we know the laws of
 65487	inevitability to which it is subject (from the fact that every man dies,
 65488	up to the knowledge of the most complex economic and historic laws).
 65489	
 65490	All knowledge is merely a bringing of this essence of life under the
 65491	laws of reason.
 65492	
 65493	Manâs free will differs from every other force in that man is directly
 65494	conscious of it, but in the eyes of reason it in no way differs from
 65495	any other force. The forces of gravitation, electricity, or chemical
 65496	affinity are only distinguished from one another in that they are
 65497	differently defined by reason. Just so the force of manâs free will
 65498	is distinguished by reason from the other forces of nature only by the
 65499	definition reason gives it. Freedom, apart from necessity, that is,
 65500	apart from the laws of reason that define it, differs in no way from
 65501	gravitation, or heat, or the force that makes things grow; for reason,
 65502	it is only a momentary undefinable sensation of life.
 65503	
 65504	And as the undefinable essence of the force moving the heavenly bodies,
 65505	the undefinable essence of the forces of heat and electricity, or
 65506	of chemical affinity, or of the vital force, forms the content of
 65507	astronomy, physics, chemistry, botany, zoology, and so on, just in the
 65508	same way does the force of free will form the content of history.
 65509	But just as the subject of every science is the manifestation of this
 65510	unknown essence of life while that essence itself can only be the
 65511	subject of metaphysics, even the manifestation of the force of free will
 65512	in human beings in space, in time, and in dependence on cause forms
 65513	the subject of history, while free will itself is the subject of
 65514	metaphysics.
 65515	
 65516	In the experimental sciences what we know we call the laws of
 65517	inevitability, what is unknown to us we call vital force. Vital force is
 65518	only an expression for the unknown remainder over and above what we know
 65519	of the essence of life.
 65520	
 65521	So also in history what is known to us we call laws of inevitability,
 65522	what is unknown we call free will. Free will is for history only an
 65523	expression for the unknown remainder of what we know about the laws of
 65524	human life.
 65525	
 65526

 65529	
 65530	CHAPTER XI
 65531	
 65532	History examines the manifestations of manâs free will in connection
 65533	with the external world in time and in dependence on cause, that is, it
 65534	defines this freedom by the laws of reason, and so history is a science
 65535	only in so far as this free will is defined by those laws.
 65536	
 65537	The recognition of manâs free will as something capable of influencing
 65538	historical events, that is, as not subject to laws, is the same for
 65539	history as the recognition of a free force moving the heavenly bodies
 65540	would be for astronomy.
 65541	
 65542	That assumption would destroy the possibility of the existence of laws,
 65543	that is, of any science whatever. If there is even a single body
 65544	moving freely, then the laws of Kepler and Newton are negatived and no
 65545	conception of the movement of the heavenly bodies any longer exists. If
 65546	any single action is due to free will, then not a single historical law
 65547	can exist, nor any conception of historical events.
 65548	
 65549	For history, lines exist of the movement of human wills, one end
 65550	of which is hidden in the unknown but at the other end of which a
 65551	consciousness of manâs will in the present moves in space, time, and
 65552	dependence on cause.
 65553	
 65554	The more this field of motion spreads out before our eyes, the more
 65555	evident are the laws of that movement. To discover and define those laws
 65556	is the problem of history.
 65557	
 65558	From the standpoint from which the science of history now regards its
 65559	subject on the path it now follows, seeking the causes of events in
 65560	manâs free will, a scientific enunciation of those laws is impossible,
 65561	for however manâs free will may be restricted, as soon as we recognize
 65562	it as a force not subject to law, the existence of law becomes
 65563	impossible.
 65564	
 65565	Only by reducing this element of free will to the infinitesimal, that
 65566	is, by regarding it as an infinitely small quantity, can we convince
 65567	ourselves of the absolute inaccessibility of the causes, and then
 65568	instead of seeking causes, history will take the discovery of laws as
 65569	its problem.
 65570	
 65571	The search for these laws has long been begun and the new methods of
 65572	thought which history must adopt are being worked out simultaneously
 65573	with the self-destruction toward whichâever dissecting and dissecting
 65574	the causes of phenomenaâthe old method of history is moving.
 65575	
 65576	All human sciences have traveled along that path. Arriving at
 65577	infinitesimals, mathematics, the most exact of sciences, abandons the
 65578	process of analysis and enters on the new process of the integration
 65579	of unknown, infinitely small, quantities. Abandoning the conception
 65580	of cause, mathematics seeks law, that is, the property common to all
 65581	unknown, infinitely small, elements.
 65582	
 65583	In another form but along the same path of reflection the other sciences
 65584	have proceeded. When Newton enunciated the law of gravity he did not say
 65585	that the sun or the earth had a property of attraction; he said that all
 65586	bodies from the largest to the smallest have the property of attracting
 65587	one another, that is, leaving aside the question of the cause of the
 65588	movement of the bodies, he expressed the property common to all bodies
 65589	from the infinitely large to the infinitely small. The same is done by
 65590	the natural sciences: leaving aside the question of cause, they seek for
 65591	laws. History stands on the same path. And if history has for its object
 65592	the study of the movement of the nations and of humanity and not the
 65593	narration of episodes in the lives of individuals, it too, setting
 65594	aside the conception of cause, should seek the laws common to all the
 65595	inseparably interconnected infinitesimal elements of free will.
 65596	
 65597	
 65598	
 65599	
 65600	
 65601	CHAPTER XII
 65602	
 65603	From the time the law of Copernicus was discovered and proved, the mere
 65604	recognition of the fact that it was not the sun but the earth that moves
 65605	sufficed to destroy the whole cosmography of the ancients. By disproving
 65606	that law it might have been possible to retain the old conception of
 65607	the movements of the bodies, but without disproving it, it would seem
 65608	impossible to continue studying the Ptolemaic worlds. But even after
 65609	the discovery of the law of Copernicus the Ptolemaic worlds were still
 65610	studied for a long time.
 65611	
 65612	From the time the first person said and proved that the number of births
 65613	or of crimes is subject to mathematical laws, and that this or that
 65614	mode of government is determined by certain geographical and economic
 65615	conditions, and that certain relations of population to soil produce
 65616	migrations of peoples, the foundations on which history had been built
 65617	were destroyed in their essence.
 65618	
 65619	By refuting these new laws the former view of history might have been
 65620	retained; but without refuting them it would seem impossible to continue
 65621	studying historic events as the results of manâs free will. For if a
 65622	certain mode of government was established or certain migrations
 65623	of peoples took place in consequence of such and such geographic,
 65624	ethnographic, or economic conditions, then the free will of those
 65625	individuals who appear to us to have established that mode of government
 65626	or occasioned the migrations can no longer be regarded as the cause.
 65627	
 65628	And yet the former history continues to be studied side by side with the
 65629	laws of statistics, geography, political economy, comparative philology,
 65630	and geology, which directly contradict its assumptions.
 65631	
 65632	The struggle between the old views and the new was long and stubbornly
 65633	fought out in physical philosophy. Theology stood on guard for the
 65634	old views and accused the new of violating revelation. But when truth
 65635	conquered, theology established itself just as firmly on the new
 65636	foundation.
 65637	
 65638	Just as prolonged and stubborn is the struggle now proceeding between
 65639	the old and the new conception of history, and theology in the same way
 65640	stands on guard for the old view, and accuses the new view of subverting
 65641	revelation.
 65642	
 65643	In the one case as in the other, on both sides the struggle provokes
 65644	passion and stifles truth. On the one hand there is fear and regret for
 65645	the loss of the whole edifice constructed through the ages, on the other
 65646	is the passion for destruction.
 65647	
 65648	To the men who fought against the rising truths of physical philosophy,
 65649	it seemed that if they admitted that truth it would destroy faith in
 65650	God, in the creation of the firmament, and in the miracle of Joshua the
 65651	son of Nun. To the defenders of the laws of Copernicus and Newton, to
 65652	Voltaire for example, it seemed that the laws of astronomy destroyed
 65653	religion, and he utilized the law of gravitation as a weapon against
 65654	religion.
 65655	
 65656	Just so it now seems as if we have only to admit the law of
 65657	inevitability, to destroy the conception of the soul, of good and evil,
 65658	and all the institutions of state and church that have been built up on
 65659	those conceptions.
 65660	
 65661	So too, like Voltaire in his time, uninvited defenders of the law of
 65662	inevitability today use that law as a weapon against religion, though
 65663	the law of inevitability in history, like the law of Copernicus in
 65664	astronomy, far from destroying, even strengthens the foundation on which
 65665	the institutions of state and church are erected.
 65666	
 65667	As in the question of astronomy then, so in the question of history
 65668	now, the whole difference of opinion is based on the recognition or
 65669	nonrecognition of something absolute, serving as the measure of visible
 65670	phenomena. In astronomy it was the immovability of the earth, in history
 65671	it is the independence of personalityâfree will.
 65672	
 65673	As with astronomy the difficulty of recognizing the motion of the earth
 65674	lay in abandoning the immediate sensation of the earthâs fixity and of
 65675	the motion of the planets, so in history the difficulty of recognizing
 65676	the subjection of personality to the laws of space, time, and cause
 65677	lies in renouncing the direct feeling of the independence of oneâs own
 65678	personality. But as in astronomy the new view said: âIt is true that we
 65679	do not feel the movement of the earth, but by admitting its immobility
 65680	we arrive at absurdity, while by admitting its motion (which we do not
 65681	feel) we arrive at laws,â so also in history the new view says: âIt is
 65682	true that we are not conscious of our dependence, but by admitting our
 65683	free will we arrive at absurdity, while by admitting our dependence on
 65684	the external world, on time, and on cause, we arrive at laws.â
 65685	
 65686	In the first case it was necessary to renounce the consciousness of an
 65687	unreal immobility in space and to recognize a motion we did not feel;
 65688	in the present case it is similarly necessary to renounce a freedom
 65689	that does not exist, and to recognize a dependence of which we are not
 65690	conscious.

 65950	Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
 65951	
 65952	Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
 65953	electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
 65954	including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
 65955	because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
 65956	people in all walks of life.
 65957	
 65958	Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
 65959	assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tmâs
 65960	goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain
 65961	freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg
 65962	Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and
 65963	permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To
 65964	learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and
 65965	how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the
 65966	Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

 65994	Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
 65995	Archive Foundation
 65996	
 65997	Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
 65998	public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing
 65999	the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely
 66000	distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array
 66001	of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to
 66002	$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with
 66003	the IRS.
 66004	
 66005	The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
 66006	charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
 66007	States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
 66008	considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
 66009	with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
 66010	where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
 66011	DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
 66012	visit http://pglaf.org
 66013	
 66014	While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
 66015	have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
 66016	against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
 66017	approach us with offers to donate.
 66018	
 66019	International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
 66020	statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside
 66021	the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
 66022	
 66023	Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
 66024	methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways
 66025	including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate,
 66026	please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

 66029	Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 66030	works.
 66031	
 66032	Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
 66033	concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
 66034	with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
 66035	Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
 66036	
 66037	
 66038	Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
 66039	editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless
 66040	a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks
 66041	in compliance with any particular paper edition.
 66042	
 66043	
 66044	Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
 66045	
 66046	     http://www.gutenberg.org
 66047	
 66048	This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including
 66049	how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
 66050	Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to
 66051	our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
