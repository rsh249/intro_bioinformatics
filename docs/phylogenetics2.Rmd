# Corrections for Phylogenetics Lesson

Last week we had some trouble getting RAxML to work for everyone that wanted to create a phylogenetic tree for our organisms:

+ Schizosaccharomyces pombe (fungus)
+ Arabidopsis (plant)
+ Kluyveromyces lactis (fungus)
+ Eremothecium gossypii (fungus)
+ C. elegans (roundworm)
+ A. gambiae (mosquito)
+ D. melanogaster (fruit fly)
+ G. gallus (chicken)
+ H. sapiens (human)
+ P. troglodytes (chimp)
+ B. taurus (cow)
+ R. norvegicus (rat)
+ X. tropicalis (frog)
+ D. rerio (fish)

Today we will solve our file conversion issues so that we get valid phylip files for input to RAxML.

### New Script

To save time here is the code for the updated script:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}

#!/bin/bash
echo "This is a bash script to do multiple sequence alignment with
muscle and phylogenetic tree construction with RAxML. Welcome!"

#Set up variables
infile='data/co1.fa'
outfile='out.phy'
jobname='tree2'
mu_maxiters=10

#Trim taxon names out of fasta header
cat $infile |  sed "s/[|]//g" | awk -F " " '{if($2 ~ /[A-Za-z_0-9]/){print ">" $2                                         }else{print $0}}' > trim.fa

wcin=$(cat trim.fa | wc -m)

./muscle -in trim.fa -phyiout $outfile -maxiters $mu_maxiters

wcout=$(cat $outfile | wc -m)

wcchange=$(expr $wcout - $wcin)

echo "Muscle added $wcchange characters.\n"


./raxml -p 12345 -s $outfile -m GTRCAT -n $jobname

echo "RAxML Finished!"


```

Changes made:
+ Use bash substitutions to trim taxon names from the fasta headers first.
+ Change output of Muscle from -out to -phyiout. This flag outputs the aligned sequences as an "Interleaved phylip file".
+ Added iterations to muscle (now 10)

Then you should be able to run the new script.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
#either:
bash script
#or
./script

```

Look at the tree in RStudio:

First install a couple new packages:
```{R, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('devtools') #fingers crossed
install.packages('dplyr')
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github('GuangchuangYu/ggtree')
```

```{R, eval =FALSE}
library("ape")
library("ggplot2")
library("ggtree")

setwd('C:/Users/rharbert/msa')
tree <- read.tree('RAxML_bestTree.tree1')
tree

ggtree(tree) + geom_tiplab()
```

### Bootstrapping

The way that RAxML (and all phylogenetics programs) work is by first building a draft tree structure (based on sequence distance, %similarity, or parsimony criteria). This initial tree is then manipulated to change branch pairings and branch lengths to see what improves the model. IF a change makes the likelihood greater then it is kept and more changes are tried. All of this injects a level of *randomness* into the tree searching algorithms. This means that you could get different arrangements on different runs or with slight variation in your dataset.

To account for potential variation you should use a Bootstrap analysis. This works like a regular statistical bootstrap where the initial data are resampled n times and the analysis is run for each of n samples. Then the consensus outcome represents the most reliable parts of the outcome.

To do this in RAxML we set the flag -f -x and -N:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}

./raxml -f a -p 12345 -x 12345 -N 20 -s out.phy -m GTRCAT -n boot1

```

And we need a second call to raxml to summarize the 20 trees into one "consensus" tree.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
./raxml -f b -t ref -z RAxML_bootstrap.boot1 -m GTRCAT -n consensus
```

And do a slightly different ggtree plotting method:

```{R, eval=FALSE}
setwd('C:/Users/rharbert/msa')
tree <- read.tree('RAxML_bipartitions.boot1')
tree

ggtree(tree) + geom_tiplab() + geom_nodelab(size=5, col='red')
```

# Homework:

Edit your script (or a new one) to do a muscle alignment with 100 iterations and a bootstrap analysis with RAxML with 100 replicates. Create ggtree figures of the output and post to [#trees](https://bio200-bioinformatics.slack.com/messages/CDMEAPW2Y)
